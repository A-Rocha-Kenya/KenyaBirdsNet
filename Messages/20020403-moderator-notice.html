  <pre>Dear friends.
It is five months since we first initiated &#34;KENYABIRDSNET&#34;
mailing group.
As it been described before, the aim of this group is to improve the 
communication among Kenyan birders and other who are interested in 
Kenya birds. With that in mind, it will also serve as communication 
tool for informing each other about interesting bird findings and 
rare observations, as well as announcing on birding activities held 
in the country.

At first we had some problem to get it started and I had to circulate 
a mail to all members regarding advertising this group with other 
bird-watchers that might have an interest.
Today we are standing on 46 members that are mostly Kenyan&#39;s and
some 
from across the globe (Netherlands, USA, Britain, Norway...), and we 
can proudly say that the list is working and being alive with an 
average of 8 messages a month (a reasonable average for this kind of 
list), though an addition of Kenyan members would make it a more 
efficient &#34;informing tool&#34; for field observations.

It is our belief that after this period of time, members will be able 
to say whether they are happy with this service? And more 
specifically, to see if you are getting what you wanted: Are there 
too many boring messages?  Would it be better to have a more strict 
moderation? Or from the other side, are there too little messages? 
And would it be better to leave this group open for the public with 
no moderation at all?

It will be great to get your opinion on this subject.
With best regards, 
Itai Shanni, group moderator.
