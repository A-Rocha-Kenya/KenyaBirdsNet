  <hr/>
  <pre>Dear friends.
today during Nature Kenya Wendsday morning bird-walk, in the area near the &#34;Carnivore&#34; we 
all had great views of a pair of Grey rumped Swallows, a good species to get around Nairobi.
later on a Long billed Pipit was spotted and by the way the bird looked and behaved it is 
probably one of these &#34;Nairobi Pipit&#34;  birds.

all the best for you all.
Itai Shanni
