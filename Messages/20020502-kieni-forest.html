  <pre>During the most recent Fundamentals of Ornithology course run by Ornithology 
Dept, NMK and NatureKenya, we had a field trip to Kieni Forest. Despite major 
and extensive and depressing damage and removal of trees that has happened over 
the 6 years that we&#39;ve been going there for the course, we had some great 
birding - best birds being Bar-tailed Trogon and Abyssinian Ground Thrush. But 
also Black-fronted Bush Shrike, Fine-banded Woodpecker, Montane Oriole, and 
crippling views of Black-throated Apalis. For about the 4th year running 
though, we&#39;ve not even heard Barred Long-tailed Cuckoo for which the site was 
well known. A good site to visit, whatever - and the more birders visiting 
there, the better... (and you can always pick up one of our endemics, Sharpe&#39;s 
Longclaw, in the fields by the road on the way out to the fly over en route 
home...)
