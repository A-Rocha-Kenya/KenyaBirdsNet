  <pre>Dear all,

Sorry that this record is already a bit overdue.... on Saturday 20 April Brian Finch and Bernd de Bruijn found a &#39;large gull&#39; at Athi Basin dam in Nairobi National Park. A Lesser Black-backed would have been nice enough in the park, but to our surprise it turned out to be a second calender-year Heuglin&#39;s Gull! As far as we are aware, this is the first record of this, usually coastal, species in Nairobi. 

Best wishes and good birding,
Bernd
