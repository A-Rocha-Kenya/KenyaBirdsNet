  <pre>Dear all

On June 3, 2002, we took a delightful boat ride from Lake Naivasha Lodge
past Ossoto (?) seasonal island and near Yatch Club Island and Crescent
Island.  Notable birds included:

Great Egret, some in breeding plumage(plumes on lower back, heavy grey beak, but yellow loral area and eyes).
Osprey
Gull-billed Tern (non-breeding plumage)

with best wishes, Fleur Ng&#39;weno
