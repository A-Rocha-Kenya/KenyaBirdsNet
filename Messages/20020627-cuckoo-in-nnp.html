  <pre>Season&#39;s greetings to everyone

Hyena Dam in Nairobi National Park is producing interesting records this
month! On Boxing 
Day there was a crested, long-tailed, all black cuckoo with a white wing
patch in a small Balanites tree about half a km southwest of Hyena Dam.
Black morph Black-and-white Cuckoo?

Last week there was a leopard padding around on the canopy of the lone
acacia tree near the dam, mobbed by crows, kites, a Eurasian Marsh Harrier
and two Grey Crowned Cranes!

Wishing you good birding in the new year, Fleur
