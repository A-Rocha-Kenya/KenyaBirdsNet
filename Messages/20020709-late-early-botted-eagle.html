  <pre>Dear friends.
i am sorry for the delay in sending this mail, i wanted to confirm 
the sighting first.
In my last trip to Samburu (29-30/6/02) on the way back just getting 
to Isiolo town a light morph of Booted Eagle was circling for few 
seconds and kept on gliding towards west.
this is (as far as i know) the only record of this species out of the 
migration season in Kenya.
if anybody knows else please let me know.
sorry again for the delay.
happy birding to all.
Itai.
