  <pre>Dear friends and members.

The Records Sub-Committee of the EANHS Bird Committee is working on 
updating the &#34;green checklist&#34; (Birds of Kenya, 3rd edition, 1996, 
EANHS), so species like the Rufous-breasted Sparrowhawk, would not 
stay under &#34;B&#34; category.
as an example, this species is defiantly not a &#34;B&#34; species, but just 
being overlooked, in it&#39;s habitat.
for that reason i urge all of you to keep on sending records to the 
Records Sub-Committee: Department of Ornithology, NMK P.O. Box 40658, 
GPO 00100, Nairobi, Kenya. e-mail: kbirds@africaonline.co.ke 
so when coming to do the update, we will have all these records on 
hand.

thanks a lot.
Itai Shanni
