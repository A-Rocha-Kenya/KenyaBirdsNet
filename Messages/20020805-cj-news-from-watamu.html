  <pre>Been fairly quiet here...
- an Af. Skimmer at Sabaki on 27/7/02 and four Green-backed Twinspots 
ringed at Mwamba this past week. Two black morph Black-and-White 
Cuckoos together by the Gede-Mld road on 28th.

Also on 24th July a good observer, Jeremy Bird, who was visiting had 
good views of what could only be a Barred Long-tailed Cuckoo in 
Arabuko-Sokoke Forest and another (not so expert observer) described 
a bird he saw hopping across the road near him in a way that sounded 
VERY like an African Pitta.... 
Typical... I had walked back to collect the car from the start of our 
transect so missed them both!! A return visit the following day 
didn&#39;t turn up anything. 
Gnyah!
