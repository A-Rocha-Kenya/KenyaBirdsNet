  <pre>Dear all,

Over the past week, several very interesting observations came to our 
notice. Even though the birds were seen several weeks ago, that doesn&#39;t mean 
they&#39;re not there anymore....

On 6th July, a potential first for Kenya was observed and photographed by a 
visiting Dutch birder, Jan Bisschop: a summer adult Arctic Tern, at Sabaki 
River mouth. Descriptions and pictures will be submitted to the Rarities 
Committee.

In early July, a Dunlin in summer plumage was found at the northern en of 
Lake Nakuru by Steve Easly.

In late July, Nigel Redman and group found a Dickinson&#39;s Kestrel along the 
road to the Thika settling ponds.

Good birding!
Bernd
