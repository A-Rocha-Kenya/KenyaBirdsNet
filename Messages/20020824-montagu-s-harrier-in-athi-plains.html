  <pre>Dear friends
i am very happy to be back, thoug i had great time in Northern Kenya.
today in Athi plains, about 10 Km east of the Whisteling Thorn hotel 
on a burnt field 3 male Montagu&#39;s Harrier (1 3rd year) was flying 
over catching insects. it seems to me to be very early for that 
species isn&#39;t it?  
eitehr then that in my trip in Northern Kenya i had the great 
oppertunity of seeing (at last) some very nice Northern species  
including the Thekla Lark, Crested Lark, White-crowned Starling, and 
a House Bunting.
all the best for now and happy birding to all.
Itai
