  <pre>Dear all,

On Sunday April 7th, Brian Finch and Richard and Anne Bishop discovered an adult Pectoral Sandpiper in Athi Basin Dam in Nairobi National Park. The bird was digitally photographed and even videoed! Later that day it was &#39;twitched&#39; by Itai Shanni, Shailesh Patel and Bernd de Bruijn (perhaps the first mobile-phone twitch in Kenia?). This Pectoral Sandpiper is only the third record for Kenia.

On the same day the latter three observers found an adult and a juvenile White-backed Night-Heron in the park. 

On Wednesday April 3th, Brian Finch and Bernd de Bruijn observed a White-headed Wagtail, the race (or species, according to some?) leucocephala of Yellow Wagtail. It was among hundreds, perhaps a thousand Yellow Wagtails that were present on the recently burnt grasslands north of Athi Basin Dam, the majority being the yellow-headed Caspian (lutea).

Also on behalf of the mentioned observers,
good birding,

Bernd de Bruijn
