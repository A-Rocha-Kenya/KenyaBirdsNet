  <pre>Dear friends,

To add to Bernd&#39;s last note, regarding Wood-Hoope in Malewa, I have 
uploaded picture of a bird, seen near the main gate of Nakuru N&#34;P by 
Arnout Linckens and Jan Bisschop on the 19th of June, 2002. The bird 
was identified as Violet Wood-Hoope by the observers, and 
looks &#34;Exactly as the ones&#34; Bernd saw in Malewa.

If accepted as Violet, it will be an interesting expantion for this 
species distribution. 

Would like to give your opinion? 

In order to see the photos you can either click on the following

or go to the group home page,

and get in to the Photos link (on the left bar) and inside you will 
find a &#34;Mystory&#34; album that you should click in and find it 
there.

All the best and happy birding,
Itai
