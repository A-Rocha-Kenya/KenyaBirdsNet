  <pre>Dear all 
yesterday (3/11) while looking at a big group of Athi Short-toed 
Larks and White-tailed Larks in the Athi basin, a strange &#34;Tchuk&#34; 
from one of the bushes caught my attention.
when looking on the source of the call, expecting to see an Olivacous 
Warbler, a bigger bird with a black tail that kept on moving 
sideways, was seen.
this was an Upcher&#39;s Warbler that was jumping inside the bushes.

other note worthy species were:
Open-billed Stork
Black Stork

and a day earlier in Peponi dam, together with Gordon Boy and Tom 
Heaton, a Temminck&#39;s Stint was spotted.

happy birding to all
Itai
