  <pre>Dear all.
to add to Richard&#39;s mail from the 10/06; today in Endashant swamp 
together with Shailesh Patel:
at least 20 Lesser Moorhen&#39;s, approx. 7 Dwarf Bittern&#39;s, 1 F Southern 
Pochard, 1 Madagascar Squacco Heron, and many Red billed and 
Hottentot Teals.
either then that:Tiny cisticola&#39;s, Southern Grosbeak Canary, Straw 
tailed and Paradise Whydah&#39;s, Black Cuckoo and also big flock of 
Nyanza and Motteled Swifts and handful of Cardinal Quelea&#39;s.

as mentioned by Richard the place looks very good for Crakes and it 
will be wise to come with rubber boots.

on behalf of Shailesh and myself
happy birding to all.
Itai
