  <pre>Dear all.
Yesterday (19/05/02) while birding in the Ngong race course, i 
spotted an Ad. male Grey Cuckoo-Shrike feeding in the forest.
this spc. is described as a common bird in mountain forests, but 
still a very local one. 
though not a new one, still a good record for the Nairobi area.
good birding to all.
Itai
