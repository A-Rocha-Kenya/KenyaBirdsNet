  <pre>Dear all,

Last Sat&#39;  together with Bernd de Bruijn and Brian Finch, an 
interesting birding day in the park.

It all started very quiet, when we did not see/hear any migrant 
around. Towards the late morning things have started to change. 
Driving towards Massai gate, we saw a bird that looks very much like 
a genuine Pallid Swift flying very low, and when reaching Massai 
gate we found an Adult Greater-Spotted Eagle flying almost overhead.
down at the river (near the gate) a couple of migrants (Willow, 
Olivaceous) join in, and the most interesting one would be a Marsh 
Warbler that is not so common around hear as it is in Ngulia.
Another interesting bird around was a Brown Parisoma that was 
jumping in the trees.

later on, looking for more Swifts in Baboon cliffs we saw a group of 
no less then 300 White Storks and many Swifts were flying low (it 
might worth keeping an open eye around and look for more Pallids).

Coming to Athi dam, we found a very strange &#34;Phoenicuroides&#34;
Red-talied Shrike (it was very red in his flanks and also did not 
have a pronounced white above his eye).
in Athi dam a full breeding Whiskered Tern was flying by and 
disappeared after a short while. and overall there were around 8 
Montague&#39;s Harriers and few more Pallid&#39;s.

as a all, a great day of birding.

all the best for now,
Itai
