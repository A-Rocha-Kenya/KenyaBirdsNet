  <pre>Dear all,

Yesterday 28th Brian Finch and Bernd de Bruijn found a White Wagtail along 
the large seasonal river a few kms past Olepolos, on Magadi Road. It was 
foraging alongside an imm. Afr. Pied Wagtail.
A (genuine) Pearl-spotted Owlet here attracted no less than 25 species, 
amongst which a Barred Warbler.

A pair and two single Bush Pipits were in the area west of Ngong Hills 
(along the road from Kisamese to Endashant), which seems to be out of their 
usual &#39;season&#39; here.

For those herpetologically interested: two Kenya Dwarf Gecko&#39;s constituted a 
southward range extension.

Good birding and very best wishes for the new year!
Bernd de Bruijn
