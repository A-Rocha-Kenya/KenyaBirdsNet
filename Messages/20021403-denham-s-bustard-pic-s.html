&gt;Anthony Wandera (Nature Kenya member) has sighted Denham&#39;s Bustard 
&gt;several times at Kuki Gallman&#39;s ranch in Laikipia. The bird has been 
&gt;sighted at least once a month. He has also kindly availed several 
&gt;good shots of the bird (using a Sony Digital Mavica FD 95 camera) to 
&gt;the office. As you probably already know, the bird is considered a 
&gt;threatened species in Kenya with reduced numbers (&lt;300) and is 
&gt;largely confined to the Laikipia Plateau and high grasslands of 
&gt;northwest Maralal (Zimmerman et al). Happy birding!
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;
&gt;Dan
