  <pre>Dear friends.

i received the following mail from James Kiptoo.

&gt;Dear All 
&gt;
&gt;Yesterday 14/o6/02 we were birding in Baringo and we saw a woolly-necked stork on a nest on 
&gt;the cliff. Some young boys told us that there are four eggs in the nest. 
&gt;
&gt;Kiptoo.
&gt;
 
it will be good to hear what is going on with this nest later on and to find out if it was a 
successful breeding.

all the best
Itai
