  <pre>Dear friends.
Today, along with Alexander Georgiev, a Bulgarian Bird-watcher 
visiting the country, we had 1 Ad Baillon&#39;s Crake, in Sukari Dam 
(Peponi School).
it seems that this place is becoming a regular place to this species, 
(last World Bird Watch, the species have been found there by Chris 
Hill and Sir Jefery James, and since then, it has been seen there at 
least another 4 times).
other interesting bird was the resident(??) African Marsh Harrier.

Happy birding to all.
Itai
