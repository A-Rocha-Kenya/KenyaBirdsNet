  <pre>Dear all,

Last weekend I observed a group of six Wood-Hoopoes sp. around Malewa River Lodge (east of Gilgil), which is right on the Malewa river in good yellow-fever tree Acacia woodland. Even when viewed at close range and in all possible lights and shades they did not appear to have any green on heads or backs, which looked all purplish-blueish instead. Sometimes a bronzy reflection was visible on the scapulars and a purplish sheen on the tail. The birds were around the same area most of the weekend; one late afternoon I saw a bird entering a hole in a dead acacia and remain inside (nest or roost?)

I have no field experience with Green niloticus (which is said to reach south to Bogoria, from where Malewa rivier would not be too far) but according to the books even these should show at least some green on head or back; Violet Wood-Hoopoes however have not been recorded further west than Nairobi National Park, as far as I&#39;m aware (but then they could be overlooked locally). Any comments welcome! (bernddebruijn@hotmail.com)

Please look out for these wood-hoopoes whenever you happen to be birding in this area. The Malewa River Lodge grounds a.e. offer good birdwatching (one of the first birds I saw there was an African Finfoot...). 

Good birding!
Bernd de Bruijn
