  <pre>Greetings from the Wednesday Morning Birdwalk

Today we saw an African Cuckoo Hawk and wonderful views of at least two
Red-throated Wrynecks at the University of Nairobi crop demonstration plot
at the end of Loresho Ridge.

You are all invited to join Nature Kenya&#39;s Sunday Birdwatch this Sunday 21
July.  Meet at the National Museum main car park at 9 am.

with best wishes from Fleur
