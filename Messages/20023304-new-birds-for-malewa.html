  <pre>i got the following mail from Eric Harris...

Thanks for all of the info passed on. Some great birds but much 
frustration at not having the time to go and see them !
 
Have just returned from four days at Malewa. Although it was not an 
ideal trip for birding - I had 53 year 8 pupils with me ! - I did see 
some good species. The following were not on the present Kigio bird 
list
 
Black Cuckoo Shrike
Black and White Cuckoo
Wahlberg&#39;s Honeybird
Black Chested Snake Eagle
Moustached Green Tinkerbird
Little Rock Thrush
Montane Nightjar
Yellow Bishop
Fish eagle (!)
