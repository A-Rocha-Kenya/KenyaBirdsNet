  <pre>Dear All 

Yesterday 13/7/2002, We saw A grey cuckoo shrike in a mixed species flock
near the Ngong road end of Tree Lane (the first turning left off Ngong road
after Karen shopping centre towards Ngong (The Ray Moore Ololua forest
site). According to Bill Harvey&#39;s check list this species is quite rare in
Nairobi (I had not seen it here before).  Other birds included one male
black throated wattleye and a thick-billed seedeater. The habitat quality
here seems to have generally declined, since I last visited. We did not see
or hear Narina&#39;s trogon which used to be regular here. 

Good birding to all.
