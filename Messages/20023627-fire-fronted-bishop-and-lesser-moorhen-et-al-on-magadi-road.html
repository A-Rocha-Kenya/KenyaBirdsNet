  <pre>Dear Members

On Sunday May 26th Brian Finch, Anne and Richard Bishop observed the
following species at the first major roadside pool (left hand side of the
road going towards Magadi) on the Magadi road immediately after the descent
from the Highlands, before reaching Oltepesi and Orllegasaillie.

Lesser moorhen- 1 juvenile
Steel blue whydah- 1+ males in breeding plumage
Fire fronted bishop- 4+ males in breeding plumage

Good birding to all,

Brian, Richard and Anne
