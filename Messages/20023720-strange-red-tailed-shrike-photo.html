  <pre>Dear friends,
i have uploaded the photo that Brian Finch took, of the strange 
Red-tailed Shrike from NNP last Sat&#39; (see message 85). It can br 
found under the Mystery file (in the photos section).

on a more thorough review it looks more like an adult 
male &#34;isabellinus&#34; but still there are some fetures that looks odd.

you are all wellcome to look and send your remarks.

all the best for now,
Itai
