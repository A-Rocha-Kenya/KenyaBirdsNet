  <pre>Dear All,

i just came back from 3 night in Ngulia, and here are some records..

on the 6th of Dec&#39; when driving to Ngulia i found a very late 
Eleonora&#39;s Falcon just after the turn to Mchakos on the main road. 
the bird was of a dark morph, straggeling to hold with the strong 
wind, and flying very low.
when coming to the park through Tsavo gate, Jamson&#39;s Firefinches and 
Purple Indigobirds were jumping all over, especially when climbing 
the escarpment. other interesting birds along the road to Ngulia 
lodge, were at least 3 Common Button-Quails, and 1 Corncrake!!

and last but surly not least, an adult dark morph Long-legged Buzzard 
was passing by mid day yesterday (the 8th) above the lodge on his way 
south.

happy birding to all,
Itai
