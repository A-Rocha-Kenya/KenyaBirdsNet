  <hr/>
  <pre>Dear members,
today in Nairobi NP (just at the tip of Hyna dam, where the creek 
from &#34;SPLASH&#34; is joining the dam), Brian Finch found a pair of 
YELLOW-BACKED WEAVERS!!!!! the male was in a breeding plumage!

the birds were spotted when a Little Bittern was coming down to the 
reeds, and they were mobbing it.

this is a very strange and unusual record for a bird that is known in 
Kenya to be confined to the reed beds of Lake Victoria, up to Ahero.

all the best for now and Merry Christmes
Itai Shanni.
