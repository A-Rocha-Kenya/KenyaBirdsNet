  <pre>Mr &amp; Mrs. Don Turner and Mr &amp; Mrs. Dave Richards were very pleased to 
confirm sightings of the rarely observed Brown-chested Plover in the Masai 
Mara on Sunday, 6th October, 2002, during a very successful but sadly short 
safari, at IL MORAN Camp.

Further details on request.

&#34;We travel together on a little space ship,
dependent upon its vulnerable reserves of air and soil,
committed for our safety to its security and peace,
preserved from annihilation only by the care, the work,
and I will say, the love we give our fragile craft&#34;
