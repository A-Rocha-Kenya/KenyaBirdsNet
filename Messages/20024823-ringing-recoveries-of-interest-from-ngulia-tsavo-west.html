  <pre>Dear friends,
here is an e-mail from Graeme Bakhurst, the cordinator of the 
Ringing Scheme of Eastern Africa:

Now I can pass on five ringing recoveries of interest, all of birds 
ringed at Ngulia, Tsavo West by members of the Ngulia Ringing Group:

Barn Swallow, ringed 28.11.2000, controlled Chokpak, Kazakhstan 
26.04.2002

Marsh Warbler, ringed 25.11.1998, found dead Kuwait 05.05.2001 (only 
just notified)

Marsh Warbler, ringed 21.11.2000, killed by cat, Fyn, Denmark 
25.07.2002

Marsh Warbler, ringed 25.11.2001, controlled Bandirma, Turkey, 
09.05.2002

Sprosser, ringed 15.12.2001, killed Alnigehah, N Egypt, 22.08.2002

&#34;Controlled&#34; means caught and released with ring intact by another 
ringer. Turkey is a &#34;new&#34; country for Ngulia recoveries and Kuwait 
is a &#34;new&#34; country for an Ngulia Marsh Warbler (we have had two 
Red-tailed Shrikes recovered there in the 1970s).
