  <pre>Dear All,

Here is the best I could do for a photo of the Yellow-backed Weaver 
at Hyena Dam in Nairobi Park yesterday 22/12. It spent most of the 
time buried in the reeds, and has a female type bird accompanying it. 
Anyway in spite of the poor quality, it is easy to see what it is, 
and is in full breeding plumage and on territory where the creek from 
Splash enters Hyena Dam. The exact same area also had Little Bittern 
(2 payesi), Purple Heron, Great and Yellow-billed Egrets, Black 
Stork, Booted and Fish Eagles and loads of Sedge Warblers. Also 
Female Jackson&#39;s Widowbird probably nesting in same place.

Compliments of the season to everyone

Brian
