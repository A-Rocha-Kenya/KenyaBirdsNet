  <pre>Dear all,

This morning a Fan-tailed Raven flew over Loresho in northwest Nbi, mobbed by a pack of Pied Crows. It was the second sighting in this locality, after one (presumably the same?) bird was seen on Oct 21st last year, so it might be &#39;around&#39;. 

By the way, now is a good time to see Peregrines in Westlands, since a pair has bred again on the Agip building (Barclays) and what seemed like (at least) one young bird is flying around. 

Good birding,
Bernd
