  <pre>Dear all,

Last Sun&#39; (26th) Brian Finch found an adult Lesser Spotted Eagle, in 
Vulture pool at Athi,  the same individual was seen later on at Ruai 
Dam, NNP.

Other interesting records are of probable Ictrine Warbler in Rhino 
Circuit. The bird was just been heard but never located. 
Also a pair of Violet Wood-hoopoes in the same place.

all the best for now,
Itai
