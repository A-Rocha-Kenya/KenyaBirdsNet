  <pre>Dear friends,
i just came back from a few days in Taita Discovery Center (TDC) and 
from Ngulia (where we had another ringing session).
and here are the most interesting records:

in TDC 26-28/12/02

* Grasshooper Buzzards are all over the place and in good numbers.
* Black-cheeked Waxbills are jumping in the bushes (not even one 
Black-faced Waxbill, though).
* Scaly Chatrers are in TDC and also in the bushes around and the 
same is true for Golden Pipits.

in Ngulia 28/12/02-02/01/03

* Ayre&#39;s Hawk-Eagle flying around the lodge.
* Sedge Warblers, Barred Warblers, few were cought and ringed.
* possibly Short-toed Snake Eagle, seen by Bernd de Bruijn on the way 
to Mzima springs.

Happy New-Year to you all, and happy birding
Itai
