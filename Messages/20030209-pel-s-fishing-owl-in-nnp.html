  <pre>Dear all,

Today in the afternoon, Brian Finch located a Pele&#39;s Fishing Owl on a 
big Fig tree along the Mbagathi river in Nairobi NP.
the bird was seen from a very close distance and later flew along the 
river towards Hippo pools.

here is a description of the exact location...

coming from Hippo pools towards Leopard cliff observation point, you 
should cross the bridge of the Mokoyeti river (just after the Baboon 
picnic site, when descending).
Immediately after the bridge there is a turn to the left and about 
100 meters later the road forks, take the left fork. this road will 
take you down to the Mbagathi river into a dead end. just in this 
dead-end there is a very very big Fig tree and the bird was seen 
first on this tree,later on flying down stream.

all the best for you all,
Itai
