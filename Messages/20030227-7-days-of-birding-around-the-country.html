  <pre>Greetings all,

Well, I was on a birding trip from 10th-17th Feb with some visitors from Denmark. 
Coming from Masai-Mara to Naivasha, we saw Caspian Plovers along the
Mara plains and in Hippo camp site, at Naivasha: 1 Great Crested Grebe, 30 Collared Pratincolas, 1 Temminck&#39;s Stint and 1 Spotted Redshank.

At L.Nakuru NP: 2 Little Ringed Plovers and 1 Northern Puffback.

in Buffalo Springs NR: 3 Somali Coursers,1 Albino Roller and in Samburu NR: 1 Booted eagle and Samburu Lodge provided us with a Shining Sunbird!

On our way back to Nairobi, overnight stay at Mountain Lodge, we saw 6 males Eastern Bronze-naped Pigeon, 1 Mountain Buzzard, few Common House Martins and some Waller&#39;s Starlings.

Shailesh
