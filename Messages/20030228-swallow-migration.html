  <pre>Whilst there are reports of the first Barn Swallows having reached SA some while back 
already, here on the Kenya coast at Watamu, we had our first proper movement of 
Swallows yesterday with a steady stream of birds pounding south just along and in 
from the beach much of the morning. There were also several flocks of Eurasian Bee-
eaters and one of Blue-cheeked heading south too - just so neat to see migration in 
action!
