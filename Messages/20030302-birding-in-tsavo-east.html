  <pre>Hallo Birders,

I  and other two friends had a good time birding in the Tsavo E. 
we had a chance of seeing some good birds among them; Bare eyed Thrush, Black bellied Sunbird, Blue capped Cordon bleu, Mouse coloured Penduline Tit and Upcher&#39;s Warbler around voi gate. 
also Somali ostrich at mudanda rock and finally quite a number of Golden Pipits and Euresian Rollers widely distributed in the park.
