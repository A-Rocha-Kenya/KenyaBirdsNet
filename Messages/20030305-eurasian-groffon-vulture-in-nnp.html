  <pre>Dear All,

Today just after noon time, Bernd de Bruijn and Myself found 2 
Eurasian Griffon Vulture in NNP.

The 1st bird was spotted within a group of Ruppell&#39;s and African 
White-backed Vultures at the &#34;Vultures Pool&#34;.
While taking photos and admiring the bird (which was a JUV bird) a 
second bird landed with another group of Vultures and this 
individual seems to be in an Imm plumage (much more rufous then the 
Juv&#39;).

Both birds were photo and can be seen under the Photos section of 
the group, in the Rarity Sub-folder.

Either then that, it is just the increase in Lesser Kestrels in the 
park that is of interest.

Happy birding to all,

Itai
