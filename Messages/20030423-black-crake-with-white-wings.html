  <pre>Greetings all

Seen at Splash Waterworld on the Wednesday Morning Birdwalk today 23 April
2003: a Black Crake with white wings.

You think I am joking?  See for yourself.  There are many Black Crakes and
Common Moorhens in and around the constructed wetlands at Splash.  This one
was seen on the pond nearest to the mini-golf.  It looked like a Black Crake
in every way (red legs, greenish-yellow conical bill, red eye) except for a
slight grey-green tinge to the black plumage, and large areas of white on
the wings when it flew.

Hope you find it, Fleur
