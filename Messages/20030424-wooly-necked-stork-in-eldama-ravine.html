  <pre>Dear all,

i got the following record from Dino Martins, a wadudu (insects) man 
that is also interested in birds...

&gt;Dear Itai and Fleur
&gt;I would like to report the sighting of a woolly-necked stork at a 
&gt;swamp in a forest east of Eldama Ravine and at Lake Nakuru- at a 
&gt;waterhole on 27th of April 
&gt;
&gt;the one at Eldama ravine was feeding amongst some hadada ibises...

happy birding to all,
Itai
