  <pre>Greetings to all

This morning (28 April) after a heavy rain in the evening, there was an
Abdim&#39;s Stork at &#34;proposed Seasonal Wetlands Biodiversity Park&#34;, the rocky
hillside near the Carnivore.  The stork was limping as it fed in the new
grass; perhaps left behind by a passing flock?

Also new to the site list was a Red-throated Wryneck seen on 23 April 2003.

Best wishes, Fleur
