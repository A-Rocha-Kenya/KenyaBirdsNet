  <pre>Greetings

More good birding on the rocky hillside with seasonal pools near the
Carnivore on a steamy Wednesday Morning 30 April.

As soon as we arrived, two Saddle-billed Storks walking the site.  A few
minutes later, a flock of big black birds flying towards us: African
Open-billed Storks.  Bernard Chege counted 41.

Several migrants were still hanging around: 2 Wood Sandpipers, 1 Common
Cuckoo, many Willow Warblers, a Sedge Warbler and a Red-backed Shrike (1st
winter?  Head rather rufous, back rufous, tail dark.)

And a mystery quail.... A small bird appeared in the sky above us, flying
like a bat (for an instant we thought it was a bat).  It was about the size
of the Little Swifts nearby, but much plumper, no visible tail, wings broad
but rather pointed at the tip.  It flew round and round, but the light was
blinding, and it was difficult to see colours.  Then the bird batted its way
towards the National Park and dipped into the wetland along the fence.

Best wishes, Fleur
