  <pre>Weds 7th, Mida Creek at high tide in the evening - GREAT views of roosting 
waders from the bird hide including a couple of Madagascar Pratincoles which 
I&#39;ve not had &#39;on the deck&#39; at Mida before, just overhead. They were chased off 
repeatedly by mostly Whimbrel... (what do Whimbrel have against Mad 
Prats...??!). Also there was a single Eurasian Oystercatcher or &#39;Oik&#39; - only my 
second for Mida, the first being in 1991 tho&#39; I have had others in more recent 
years at Sabaki and at the mouth of the Tana.

Atr Sabaki River Mouth on Saturday 10th and had 450+ Mad Prats flying in from 
the north east (foraging over the scrublands and woodlands?? Interesting...) 
and there were a heck of a lot more I didn&#39;t count. Total probably 650-900 
birds on the estuary. Awesome! 

Also visited Lake Chemchem on 10th which is currently totally dry as well... 
(we are in the middle of a drought here on the coast...), had Mangrove 
Kingfisher there and two more around Mwamba including a juv, that was caught 
and ringed at the w/e. This species appears to be migratory around here, 
disappearing for many months and reappearing around now... Talking of Afro 
migrants, all the Red-capped Robin Chats are now back mimicing Crowned Eagles 
and Emerald Cuckoos and otehr species I don&#39;t recognise from their breeding 
grounds; and the first Spotted Ground Thrush for the year was seen on the 
nature trail in Arabuko-Sokoke near Geded Forest Station last week. A thorough 
search was made in Gede Ruins forest but none were located. Af. Pygmy 
Kingfishers returned about a month ago now with one flying into my house 
yesterday afternoon and perching on the ceiling fan briefly (the fan wasn&#39;t 
switched on!!).
