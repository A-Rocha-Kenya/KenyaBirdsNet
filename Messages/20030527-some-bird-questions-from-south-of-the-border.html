  <pre>Dear all.
Please find below an e-mail with a few questions for all group members from
the &#39;Tanzanian Bird Atlas&#39;.
Any comments and observations are most welcome:

Dear all,
For the past few years we have noticed a range expansion of White-browed
Sparrow Weavers southwards from border areas to Tarangire NP and along the
Pangani Valley. Has there been a coresponding increase in range within Kenya
or, are we seeing a shift in the population.

During the last 2 years we have noticed an increase in Speke&#39;s Weavers to
the south and east of the range when we arrived in West Kilimanjaro in 97.
Again, is anyone noticing a range expansion or shift in population of this
species.

There have been several notices on the Tanzania birdnet about large numbers
of breeding condition male whydahs and indigobirds this year. Has anyone
noticed a similar increase in concentrations in Kenya?

Many thanks,
Neil.
