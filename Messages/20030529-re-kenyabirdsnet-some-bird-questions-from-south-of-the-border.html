  <pre>Re range expansion of White-browed Sparrow-Weaver:

White-browed Sparrow-Weavers have expanded their range considerably within
Nairobi in the last twenty years.  They once occurred mainly on the eastern
edge of the city, and now they are right in the centre, building nests in
the Parliament building gardens.

Best wishes, Fleur Ng&#39;weno
