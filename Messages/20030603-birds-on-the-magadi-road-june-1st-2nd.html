  <pre>Dear All

On June 1st there was a fire fronted bishop directly adjacent to the
seasonal pool on the left hand side of the road at the base of the descent,
a couple of kilometers on the Nairobi side of Oltepesi.

Other interesting sightings were a capped wheater on the entrance track into
Orlegasaille prehistoric site, several cardinal queleas in full breeding
plumage, and numerous breeding chestnut weavers all over the general area.
There was also a male and female house sparrow present at Orlegasaille (we
had not seen them there before). 

Good birding,
