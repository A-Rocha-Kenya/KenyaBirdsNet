  <pre>Dear all,

yesterday when writing the Larks message i didn&#39;t put
this record just to confirm my sighting first.

on the morning of the 14th while drinking Coffee in
Kilaguni, an Ad. Barbary Falcon was flying very fast
(hunting?) low above the grass in front of the lodge.

i was very amazed to see the species in mid June and
therefore, in spite of a long experience with the
species from Israel, i decided to check the books
first before publishing it.

the &#34;peregrine like&#34; structure with a longer tail
(longer than a Peregrine) and more pale coloures on
the upper-side (much paler than our Peregrine) and
also the lack of any distinct barring on the tail
(like a Peregrine and unlike any Lanner i know). 
all these together with my experience with the species
gave me more then a reason to believe that this is
indeed a Barbary Falcon. it is just this date (14th in
June) that makes it so hard to believe...

all the best to you all,
Itai
