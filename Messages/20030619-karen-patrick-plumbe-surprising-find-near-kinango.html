  <pre>Dear Everyone
After a few days last week at Tiwi, where we saw several Brown 
Breasted Barbets, an abundance of Green Pigeons, and Eurasian Golden 
Orioles, Black Bellied Starlings and an Ashy Flycatcher, we decided 
to avoid the hassles of the Ferry and Mombasa town and take the Kwale 
Kinango Mariakani route on our return to Nairobi. Passing thru very 
dry scrubby bush and parched mealie plantations, our attention was 
caught by a Golden Pipit, so stopped for a better look when a flash 
of red and green materialized into a Narina Trogon which kindly posed 
briefly for us. It seemed surprising to find this bird in such dry 
habitat??  
 
Karen and Patrick Plumbe
