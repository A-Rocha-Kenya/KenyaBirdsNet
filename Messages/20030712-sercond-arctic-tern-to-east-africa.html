  <pre>Dear all,

On the photos section (under Mystery) you can find a Tern photo that 
was taken by Brian Finch a week ago in Nakuru NP.
It seems very likely that this is a sub-adult, winter plumage, 
Arctic Tern; the short whole red bill and very short red legs are 
very distinct for this species.  The faint remaining of a dark 
carpal patch and the white tip of the forehead seems as good signs 
for the age.   
As this species is first recorded in Kenya (and East Africa) just 
last July 6th by Jan Bisschop and Arnout Linckens at Sabaki River 
mouth (a record that still need to be approved by the Rarity 
Committee), this second claim, at the same month and almost the same 
day, is very interesting.

The bird was seen on the southern most tip of Lake Nakuru and may 
very well still be there.

I call all who have any experience with the species (and the will) 
and other who have the interest and time, to have a look at this 
photo (or try and find it again in Nakuru NP) and send me your 
comments.

All the best and happy birding,
Itai
