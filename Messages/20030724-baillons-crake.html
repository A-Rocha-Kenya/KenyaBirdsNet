  <pre>On 6th July, Marc Languy and I visited Ndashant wetland and found 2 Lesser Moorhen and 2 Baillons Crake, but no sign of any Striped Crake, though the water/grass conditions looked good, but then again they are very elusive.  A pair of Crowned Cranes were also present with three small chicks.

Best wishes to all

Nigel Hunter
