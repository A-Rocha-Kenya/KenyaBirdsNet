  <pre>Dear all,

i got the following from Neil Baker...

&#34; Your note on the White-headed Vulture sighting in NNP prompts this 
msg. 
Can you paste this map on your web site? It will give your members a 
feel for this bird in Tanzania. Could it be shown alongside a similar 
map for Kenya?
I can then alert TZ birdnet members to this.&#34;

i uploaded Neil&#39;s map and it can be seen under the photos section.
as for our (Kenya) map, unfortunately we don&#39;t have a digital format 
yet. BUT, the current work on the &#34;Kagu Project&#34; (the new Records 
Database for Kenya) might be of assistance in the future.

for any more references to Tanzania Atlas project please look at the 
following details:
