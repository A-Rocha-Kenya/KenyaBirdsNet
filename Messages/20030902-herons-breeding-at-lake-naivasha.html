  <pre>Greetings birders

Lake Naivasha has risen considerably with the rains in recent weeks.

On a boat ride on Saturday 30 August 03, we noted a thick bed of reeds just
beyond the tip of Crescent Island.  It was packed with dozens of Long-tailed
Cormorants and Grey, Purple, and Common Squacco Herons, with a few Cattle
Egrets.  Some of the Grey Herons were in breeding plumage with pink-red
beaks.

A wonderful wheeling flock of Whiskered and White-winged Terns rounded off a
delightful boat ride.   Fleur
