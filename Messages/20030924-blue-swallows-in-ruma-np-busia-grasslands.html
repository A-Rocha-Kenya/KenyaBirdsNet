  <pre>Its great to report that during a rapid survey of Blue
Swallows (27 Aug - 5 Sept) in Kenyan sites, we saw
over 40 Blue swallows in Ruma National park (27-30
August)and over 15 in two sites (Iseka and Musokoto)in
Busia near Mungatsi (2 &amp; 3 Sept.

Quite a number of those seen in Ruma NP were seen
perched mostly on short dry Acacia drepanolobium
trees, on sparcely wooded grasslands between the
Airstrip and Wiga gate.

A detailed report is in the pipeline.
