  <pre>DEAR BIRDERS,
ON THE 28TH SEPT, I WAS IN AMBOSELI AS I WAS DRIVING
THROUGH THE TALL ELEPHANT GRASS I HEARD A FLOCK OF
BIRD CALLS WHICH DREW MY IMMEDIATE ATTENTION AND ON
TOP OFF THE GRASS WERE 12 ZEBRA WAX BILLS PERCHED.HAS
THEIR BEEN A RECORD OF THESE BEAUTIFUL BIRDS BEFORE IN
AMBOSELI?
  YOUR RESPONSE WILL BE HIGHLY APPRECIATED.
       GOOD BIRDING.
                   MEL
