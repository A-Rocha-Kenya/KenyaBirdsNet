  <pre>Dear all, 

On 8-10 September an expedition was mounted by botanist Quentin Luke to Ngaia Forest in Nyambeni Hills, north of Maua near Kioteni. According to literature, this forest may be one of the last localities in Kenya for Black-and-White Flycatcher, the medianus race of Broadbill (display heard by Quentin Luke during an earlier visit) and the keniensis race of Chestnut-fronted Helmet-Shrike. Sadly however, none of these were recorded during this most recent, short visit; which is not to say that they are not there of course. It had been quite dry and song activity was low; most time was spent in the lower (1,100 m) part of the forest and only a few hours in the higher, more lush area at 1,400 m. Although most of the forest appeared to be in good shape, there was quite some firewood cutting going on. 

The most interesting record was that of Fischer&#39;s Greenbuls, being fairly common and associated with mixed flocks usually containing Blue-mantled Crested and Paradise Flycatchers (white morph dominant), Black-headed Apalis and Collared Sunbird. According to Zimmerman et al., although Fischer&#39;s extends inland only slightly along the Tana, there are no inland records. 
Other nice records (but also known from Meru NP) were Peter&#39;s Twinspots, Red-capped Robin-Chat (with juvenile), Eastern Nicator and Bat Hawk. A Brown-chested Alethe was very tame, actually approaching us up to 30 cm and waiting for us to stir up some insects. 

Apparently there may still be things to discover in this now unique, little visited forest; this has already been the case for several trees and plants. It is hoped that another visit, with more extensive exploration of the higher areas will bring more information on the species mentioned earlier. 

Good birding,
Bernd de Bruijn
