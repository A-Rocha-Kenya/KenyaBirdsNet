  <hr/>
  <pre>I&#39;ve been contacted by a good Portuguese friend and manic and good birder, Goncalo 
Elias, who is coming birding here at the end of the Nov / beginning of Dec to visit 
Ngulia and then travel north to bird northern Kenya and Kakamega for a week or so. 
He&#39;s asked me if I know of anyone who&#39;d be interested in joining him for the trip and 
help share costs of transport etc. Anyone interested can write to him direct: 
&lt;goncalo.elias@vodafone.com&gt;
