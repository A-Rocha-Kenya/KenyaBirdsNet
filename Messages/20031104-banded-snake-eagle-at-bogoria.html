  <pre>Hi All,

A further record from our recent trip (with thanks to Itai for
confirming our ID).

24th of October - Lake Bogoria - Banded Snake Eagle (Circaetus
cinerascens). This was seen in the woodland at the southern end of the
lake. Just after the turn off to the public campsite.

Regards
Helen Harris
