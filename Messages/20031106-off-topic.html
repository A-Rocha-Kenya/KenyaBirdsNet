  <pre>My apologies to everyone for this e-mail, but I believe Colin Jackson is
away for 10 days, and I urgently need some advice
 
I am on a major birding trip, wandering up from South Africa through
Mozambique up to Egypt, and then hoping to cross over to west Africa early
next year.  However, I now have to urgently get to Nairobi so I can fly back
for my father&#39;s funeral.
 
Can anyone advise me where it would be safe to leave my Landrover in Nairobi
for a week.  I am not sure if the airport would be safe, and I doubt any of
the large hotels would like a vehicle parked for so long given the security
problems.
 
Any advice would be most welcome
 
Again, apologies for the misuse of the list,
 
Giles
