  <pre>Dear All

There was a juvenile greater spotted eagle present in the evening of
Saturday 8th and early morning Sunday 9th November near the Mouth of the
Nderit river on the Southern Shore of Lake Nakuru. In the morning it was
together with about 25+ steppe eagles and 5+ Tawny Eagles.

Good birding to all.

Richard and Anne Bishop
