  <pre>with this huge flock of 1 million Lesser Flamingos (and 100,000 Grreaters) in India it&#39;s an ideal time to estimate numbers in East Africa.

we will be looking closely at all our flamingo lakes in the coming weeks and it would be great to have similar information from Kenya. Estimates of either species are good enough if counts are not possible. If we wait until January we might miss the opportunity.

Jane, our satellite tagged Greater is still at Rasini, just north of Malindi. We would love to know if she&#39;s alone or with thousands of others.

thanks
Neil
