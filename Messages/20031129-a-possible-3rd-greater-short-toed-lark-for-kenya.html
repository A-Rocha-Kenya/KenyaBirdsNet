  <pre>Dear all,

Yesterday evening a SMS came from Brian Finch (who is leading a tour 
at the moment), of a bird on the Solio plains that looks like a 
Greater Short-toed Lark. The bird was photographed and more details 
of this sighting will be available soon.

If accepted by the Rarity Committee this record will be the 3rd to 
EA!!

All the best for now,
Itai
