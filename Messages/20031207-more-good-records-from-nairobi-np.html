  <pre>Dear all,
Yesterday (6/12/03) in NNP together with Gonc&#39;alo Elias, Rui Vrito 
and Brian Finch; few interesting migrants have been located.
While stopping for a morning cap of coffee (which was lacking so we 
used Coke instead) at Kingfisher Picnic site we had a great view of 
a Sub-ad Imperial Eagle circling over our heads (this should be the 
same individual that was first spotted at the same place in late 
Nov&#39;. just above him a Sooty Falcon was flying SE. after a while at 
the Vulture Pool a Eurasian Griffon Vulture gave us a good show 
(with all the Ruppell&#39;s &amp; White-Backed Vultures around it was very 
easy to differentiate). Another bird there was a juv&#39; bird that had 
a mix characteristics of both Ruppell&#39;s and Eurasian Griffons; the 
wings looked very much like a juv&#39; Eurasian while the legs were 
mottled just like Ruppell&#39;s. In recent years, there are more and 
more records of mixed pairs of these two species both in Ethiopia 
and in Portugal; can this individual represent a Hybrid? Not far 
from the Vultures there were more then 3 individuals of Pink-
breasted Longclaws, all in full song.

Today (7/12/03), the Eurasian Griffon Vulture was spotted again, at 
the same place, this time the presumed Hybrid was not to be found.

Happy birding to all,
Itai
