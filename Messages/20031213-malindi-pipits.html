  <pre>Dear All,

Further to CJ&#39;s Malipits at Sabaki, I have found it not unusual to find
the odd ones in that area, especially just after the rains in May/June.
I&#39;ve also seen one at Mida in 2001. I can&#39;t find any records of my
having seen then outside of this period.

I guess they are probably forced south of their normal haunts after
rains. I know there was some heavy rain around Jan time, although I
don&#39;t know if this affected the coast, as I&#39;m here in the UK and rely on
Nation online for day-to-day news. This might account for CJ&#39;s obs.

Nigel
