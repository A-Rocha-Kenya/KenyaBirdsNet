Dear All

I&#39;ve recently returned from leading a Sunbird tour to Kenya during which we saw an unusually large number of Lesser Jacanas.  I&#39;m wondering if anyone else has seen this species lately and whether there might have been a bit of an arrival or invasion?

The birds I saw were along the dirt road from Ol Joro Orok to Nakuru (the road that goes via Dondori). Travelling southwest along that road from Ol Joro Orok after just a few miles the road descends into a valley and crosses a stream with a small lake on the left and a marsh on the right.  Just beyond the marsh there is a fairly big school.  We saw one Lesser Jacana on the small lake here (initially spotted by Mel Ogola).  A little further along the road, there is a much larger lake in a valley down to the left, with a dirt road that runs along the top of the dam that creates the lake.  On this lake we saw another 5-6 Lesser Jacanas and there may well have been more.

In 22 previous trips to Kenya I have only seen two single Lesser Jacanas, so 6-7 in one area seemed pretty outstanding to me.

Does anyone know of any other recent records?

(I&#39;ve only just joined this e-mail group, so should there have been any other recent correspondence about this species, please forgive me for being unaware of it).

Best wishes,

David
