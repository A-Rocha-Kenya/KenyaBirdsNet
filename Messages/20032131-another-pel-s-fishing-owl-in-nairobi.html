  <pre>Dear all,

Here is another sighting of this enigmatic species.
This time it is Mr. Will Knocker how has this great luck.
Here is his description.

Dear Itai -
Nice to hear from you &amp; I trust all is well with you.
This Pel&#39;s was a first for me &amp; I was staggered to see it  11 am in 
thick riparian forest on the Mbagathi/Embakasi River in a very quiet 
stretch just above Maasai Lodge. I flushed it &amp; by very good luck it 
put up on the branch of a fig-tree &amp; I was able to get a good look 
at it through the binocs  unmistakeable  large size, Rufous colour 
&amp; large black eyes! Hope this is enough info....if you would like to 
come out to Kitengela (I live right next to the Maasai Gate of the 
Park) we could hunt for it.........I wonder what this bird is eating 
as cat-fish not found this far up the river....
Salaams       Will Knocker
