  <pre>Dear all,

Yesterday (5th July) in NNP together with Alex
Georgiev and Elizabeth Hamilton, in spite of a very
miserable weather (drizzled most of the day); two
&#34;local rarities&#34; were spotted;

Early in the morning, 1 Zebra Waxbill was eating near
point 4 (where the tarmac road ends).
Later, near Rhino circuit (just near point 11C) an
Imm&#39; White-headed Vulture!! was seen and photographed.
The bird was perched on top of an Acacia, near the
road � this species is a scarce visitor in NNP, more
common in the Massai-Mara NR and the Tsavo�s.

All the best and happy birding,
Itai
