  <pre>Dear all i got the following from Brian:

Dear All,

Back from Eremit, best birds at least ten territories of FF bishops, 
possibly the tens of thousands of Cardinal Queleas, noisy Freckled 
Nightjars, a very late House Martin flying feeding on a small piece 
of flood water on morning 7th June, very very late, never seen a June 
bird before, and a dark Dimorphic Egret at the hot springs Magadi.

Otherwise birds were as normal, all four Whydahs, abundance of 
Chestnut Weavers and Sparrows all of which breeding, huge numbers of 
Singing Bushlarks etc. Northern Brownbuls but I had that there last 
year.

all the best,
Brian
