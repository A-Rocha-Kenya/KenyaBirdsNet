  <hr/>
  <pre>It was almost exactly a year ago that we had an adult brown morph Red-footed Booby 
washed up on the beach exhausted and unable to fly... That one Bio-ken snake farm 
managed to recuperate and I ringed and released it. On Dec 7th this year another adult 
brown morph Red-footed Booby was washed up on the beach exhausted and unable to 
fly. This time however it was too far gone and it sadly died the following morning. It&#39;s 
currently in the freezer and will be deposited in the collection at the National Museums 
Ornithology Dept.

Otherwise somewhat quiet down here at the coast... other than a Caspian Plover at 
Sabaki on 5th Dec...
