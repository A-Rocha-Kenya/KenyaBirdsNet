  <pre>Greetings to All Birders,

Over the last week of August, together with Denis
Fairbank and Amossen Helge, birders from Denmark, we
had a wonderful trip to Lake Baringo, Bogoria, Nakuru
and the Mara-tracking the migration.

Starting at Lake Baringo on 28th, we had a hard time
crossing the two bridges recently swept by water after
heavy rains in May 2003 between Marigat and Lake
Baringo. Due to heavy rains in Western Kenya and up
Kabarnet, the two majors rives were very strong and
strictly only a territory for a serious 4x4 with a
dedicated driver to cross here. After a successful
crossing with a 4x4 we went to birder�s paradise-Lake
Baringo club.

Due to the heavy rains, the Lake is wonderfully full
and only a few meters to the Lake Baringo club grounds
and full of �thick forest� of reeds and river Acacias
with a carpet of Nile cabbages. Here you wonder what
to look first, as there is colourful Northern Red and
Yellow-crowned Bishops, Little Bittens, Allen�s
Gallinule, Black Crakes and Green-backed Herons are
virtually everywhere.

A boat ride takes you even closer to all this great
collection of birds and even more interestingly to the
many Purple Herons and Madagascar Bee-Eaters patiently
perched on River Acacias. This is for sure one of the
best times to visit Lake Baringo!

Over to Lake Bogoria, which has also risen up
considerably and with respectively few Flamingos now.
Here we recorded several flocks of Magpie Starlings
and also huge flocks of Barn Swallows.

At Nakuru on 1st of September, we saw three Lesser
Jacanas at Muya�s causeway-a lovely place to pose and
wait for what would come to those fresh water pools.
Here, Whiskered, Gull-billed Terns and Sand Martins
perch on top of the sedge Grass! 

After a successful visit at the Mara and Back to
Nairobi, on 5th of September, together with
Michael-Sarus Bird Tours-Switzerland, we had
successful excursion to Nairobi NP and along Magadi
Road. It is surprisingly how fast the seasonal pools
and rivers along this area have dried. Near Ole Tepesi
shopping centre, we saw 4 Taita Fiscals. 

Nice birding to all.

Ben Mugambi.
