  <pre>              A GLIMPSE OF BIRDING IN KILGORIS:
For those who may not be aware of this location, It is 60kms to the north
of Masai Mara GR. on the
High plateau above the Oloololo escarpment. Being in a totally different
habitat from the lower Mara plains, with an indigenous forest on one side,
cultivated area and small hills on the other side, Kilgoris is a home to a
variety of birds&#39; species, some not found in the Lower Mara i.e. ludher&#39;s
bush shrike, Blue headed coucal etc. To give you a hint if what to expect
here, these are a few species I came across during a brief birding last
week on the hilly country to the east of Kilgoris.
