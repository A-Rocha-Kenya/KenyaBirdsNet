  <pre>Dear all,

Recently Mark Harries reported to Nature Kenya a group of around 8 Hinde&#39;s 
Babblers on his farm in Juja (southeast of Thika), which he had first 
noticed in November 2001 and had been around ever since. To our knowledge, 
this was only the second record from that general area in recent times, and 
earlier surveys around Thika had been without success. After communicating 
with Mr Harries we visited his farm yesterday, saw one pair and heard 
another group. The farm is on the banks of Ruiru river, not very far from Ol 
Donyo Sabuk, and (with the neighbouring farm included) there is about 50 
acres of intact bush habitat. NMK Department of Ornithology will be looking 
into possibilities to organise a survey along the river banks to assess this 
population, which as far as we are aware has so far escaped attention. It is 
very encouraging that the birds are there and in a protected, natural 
habitat.

Bird diversity in general was quite extraordinary, with up to 80 species in 
one morning on a single walk! Mr Harries&#39;s checklist stands at 200 and 
includes Finfoot, Purple-crested Turaco, Brown-hooded Kingfisher, a breeding 
pair of Wahlberg&#39;s Eagle. Food, water and cover attract huge numbers of 
birds, provoking associations with the Lake Baringo Club grounds.... Camping 
facilities and bandas will be built in the near future, providing an 
excellent bird outing within an easy drive from Nairobi.

Good birding, best wishes,

John Musina, Gert Spierenburg, Bernd de Bruijn
