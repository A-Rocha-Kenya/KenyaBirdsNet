  <pre>Dear All

On Sunday 24th Anne and I saw the following:

(1) 2+ African silverbills, near the Athi Basin dam. We have never seen this
species in the NNP before. According to the Bill Harvey checklist, the last
records were between 1972-1979.

(2) A male buttonquail on a track also near Athi basin dam

(3) Three different African Marsh owls in different locations on the outer
circuit on the way out. Has there been a population explosion? The grass is
still very long and lush for this time of year so I presume that the rodent
populations are currently high.

Good Birding

Richard and Anne.
