&gt; Hallo Birders,
&gt; While counting Water birds in Nakuru we saw a crake
&gt; that we Identified us a spotted crake. In my team of
&gt; four I spotted this shy bird and quickly pointed it
&gt; out to my mates. The most stricking feature I noted
&gt; before sharing my pair of binoculars to one of us
&gt; was
&gt; - the yellow bill and the red base of the bill
&gt; especially on upper mandible, the spotted back,
&gt; greyish underparts and head and light under tail
&gt; coverts. Mwoki who we were counting with also saw
&gt; the
&gt; bird very well(we managed to take more notes too)
&gt; and
&gt; looking at the book and the description in the text
&gt; we
&gt; ended up councluding it to be a spotted crake!
&gt; This was below the WCK hostels shore line.
&gt; Nico.
