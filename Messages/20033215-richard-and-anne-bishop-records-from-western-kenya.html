  <pre>Dear all,
here are records coming from the Bishop&#39;s...

&#34;...Western Kenya was quite rushed, as we only had three days.
However, thanks to your detailed instructions we managed to see the 
Red Patas&#39;s and Red-necked Falcon at Alupe. 
Also good views of one Lesser Jacana at the Eldoret airport dam (as 
close to the dam wall it could possibly be) and the &#34;new&#34; stonechat
(looks rather like albofasciatus without white in the wing). 

Pale breasted Illadopsis at Yala and also Yellow-bellied Wattleye in 
both Yala reserve and the Grid.

also House Sparrow in the petrol station at the Mumias/Busia junction 
much the furthest West I have seen them in Kenya.&#34;

good birding to all,
Itai
