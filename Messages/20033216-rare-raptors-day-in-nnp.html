  <pre>Dear all, 
Yesterday (16/03/03) when birding in NNP, together
with Brian Finch, we had one of the greatest
concentrations of rare raptors one can find in one
day�

We started in the forest (near Langata gate) where we
found big group of migrant Warblers in the bushes near
one of the forest pools (roughly 30 Blackcaps and
Garden Warbler on one single bush).
When driving down towards the plains (which have just
been lately burnt) we could all ready see many raptors
flying over. It was mainly Harriers and Kites, but
among them where few more �interesting-looking� birds.
First, a group of 3 Lesser Spotted Eagles were found
flying over; unfortunately the birds disappeared into
the clouds very soon and could not be detected again.
Not long after, a pale morph Long-legged Buzzard was
spotted, hovering above the plains (this bird was seen
for roughly 30 min� and with the many raptors in the
air, we had good comparative views, including with a
Common/Steppe Buzzard).

Enjoying this �raptor show�, we stayed in the area a
little more, and after a while it proved to be a good
choice. A dark Aquila was soon on the scene, and this
time a Greater Spotted Eagle, was the main actor.

We kept on driving enjoying the many Montague�s
Harriers (roughly 50 individuals were seen during the
entire day), Red-capped Larks and many other species,
when Brian noticed a big raptor perched on a dead
tree. The bird was noticeably big (for any Aquila) and
had conspicuous streaks all over the chest and dark
buff lower belly and undertail coverts; Narrow
inconspicuous bars on the tail; relatively massive
head and bill and pale brown eyes. All these features,
and more, brought us to the conclusion that the bird
was a Sub-Adult Imperial Eagle (photos have been taken
and can be seen on the Rarity sub-folder of the Photos
section).

We then continued towards Athi dam, and just before
getting there a local rarity was spotted, not a raptor
but a Sand Martin. There was nothing unusual at the
dam, but on the way back when stopping to look if
there are any Vultures at the �Vultures Pool�, we
found 3 Eurasian Griffon�s bathing among the African
White-backed and Ruppell�s Vultures (photos can be
seen in the Rarity sub-folder). In the last few years,
more and more records are coming for this species and
it might be considered a more regular visitor in the
country (or at least, listed in the Kenyan list).

After these amazing records (all in one day), we
didn�t really expect to get any other unusual birds,
but to our surprise, just before leaving the park
(again through Langata gate) a Eurasian Honey Buzzard
was flying low over our heads, looking for a roost.

So once again, Nairobi NP proves to be a �rare raptors
magnet�.
Happy birding to all,
Itai
