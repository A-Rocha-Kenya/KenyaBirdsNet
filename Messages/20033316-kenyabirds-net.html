Dear all

Not much on my birding front just now due to pressure of other work.

However my Tudor garden (on the creek) had a new visitor, a Broad Billed Roller. Not very rare, but not usually seen on Mombasa Island. Fortunately not bothered by the crows who were leaving it alone. 

I&#39;m loving reading about everybody else&#39;s exciting birding. Especially interesting to hear that Orange Winged Pytilia was seen at Maweni Cottages. Other coastal records have been from Shimba Hills area.

Have a great birding day everybody! Marlene Reid
