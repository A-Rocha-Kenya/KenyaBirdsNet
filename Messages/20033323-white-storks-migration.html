  <pre>dear all,

i just came back from a 7 days safari in the central
highlands and Massai-Mara.

after Brian&#39;s last report on the lack of migrants
around, i was quit happy to see that things are
changing, in every place we&#39;ve been throughout the
tour there were many Blackcaps and Willow Warblers and
also it seemed that the Wheatears are re-appearing. 

but the most amazing record of this tour (which was
not a birding tour) was of a huge flock of White
Storks, a rough estimate will be of 15,000 birds
flying in 4 groups over Talek area due south on the
22nd of Dec&#39;. 
it was the first time for me to see a group of that
size here in EA (a group that will be more appropriate
up in the Middle-east or the Gibraltar). 

many greetings to the coming holidays and have great
birding,

Itai
