  <pre>Hallo Friends,

I have just thought that this could be interesting!

I have just come back to Nairobi from a short tour to
the coast, where I managed to record some few nice
species, even though I was not on a bird watching
mission.

On 4th of May I visited Maweni Beach Cottages near
Capricon Beach Hotel, a kilometer from Kwale junction
on Likoni-Diani road, turn left and follow signs for
another kilometer! This is perhaps one of the many
small best birding spots of the coast, which are not
well explored. 

They have very nice grounds full of a great assortment
of fruiting trees-fig trees (several species) and
flowering shrubs making the compound to attract a wide
selection of birds. There is a small thick-bushed
typical coastal forest on the southern side of the
Cottages, offering a very nice nature walk with a
number of nice coastal specialities. Also being
adjacent to the beach, you have a great variety of
waterbirds making a nice long list, in just 45
minutes, I had 63 species!

 Although, most of the birds around here are mostly
common coastal species, Itï¿½s interesting to see the
grounds full of Purple-Banded, Olive and
Mouse-Coloured Sunbirds; perhaps one of the few places
at the coast one can see them in abudance. Other
interesting species were Black-Headed Batis,
Black-Collared Babbet and Brown-Breasted Babbet. On
our way out from the Maweni cottages, we saw an adult
male Orange-Winged Pytilia in full coloured plumage!

On 7th of May, I had a quick visit to Lake Chem Chem,
west of Malindi town along Malindi-Tsavo East, Sala
gate road. Here it was fairly quet, but with a flock
of over 200 Collared Pranticoles and a few Lesser Grey
Shrikes to remind us that the migrants are still
around!

Wishing you a happy rainy season birding!

Regards, Ben Mugambi.
