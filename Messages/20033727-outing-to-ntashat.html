  <pre>Greetings birders

Nature Kenya members enjoyed the outing to the Tana organised by Catherine
Ngarachu so much that we decided to have another outing this Saturday 31 May
2003.

The destination this time will be Ntashat (a.k.a. Ndashant, Endashant,
Indachant) behind the Ngong Hills.  Meet at the National Museum, Nairobi, at
7:15 a.m. on Saturday.  All are welcome, subject to the availability of
transport.

Good birding, Fleur
