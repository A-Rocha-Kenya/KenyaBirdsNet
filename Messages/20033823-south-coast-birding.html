  <pre>Dear all,

i just came back from a short visit to south coast (an area between 
Diani and Chale).
as a whole there are many migrants around (and some that &#39;over-
summered&#39;) the most interesting record was of an early Common Tern 
many Sand Plovers (Greaters and Lessers), Grey Plovers and Curlew 
Sandpipers. also of interested was a lone Crab Plover in South Coast 
(my 1st south of Watamu).

there is a new initiative of local communities (together with the 
National Museum) to develop the Kaya forest (this is NOT any of the 
Kaya&#39;s mentioned in the IBA book) and in a very short visit there, i 
managed to find both Black-collared and Brown-breasted Barbets and a 
few other coastal &#39;specials&#39; (like Mombassa Woodpecker, Red-tailed 
Ant Thrush and more...)

i invite all that are visiting Diani area to go and explore more 
this forests and see what other interesting species are hidden there.

Happy birding to all,
Itai
