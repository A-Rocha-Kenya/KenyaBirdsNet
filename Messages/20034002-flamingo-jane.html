  <pre>Hi everyone.
Just to let you all know that one of our sat tagged Greater Flamingos is at
Rasini just north of Malindi. She went from the Rift Valley to Mida Creek
(between 7th and 14th August) and has been at Rasini since at least the 22nd
September until the 1st October so is probably still there.

We would love to know if she&#39;s alone or with company. If the latter can we
please have numbers with age and sex.

Many thanks
Neil
