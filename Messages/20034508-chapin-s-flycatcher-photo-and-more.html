  <pre>Dear all,

I have just loaded the photo of a Chapin&#39;s Flycatcher, taken by 
Brian Finch in Kakamega forest to our photos section.

Another interesting new photo is again from Kakamega, by Brian. This 
is an Imm&#39; Ayres&#39;s Hawk-Eagle a morph that is Not very regularly 
seen in Kenya.

Just to remind you all, the photo section is for Rare, Interesting 
and Mystery birds. In few weeks I will delete most of the photos, in 
order to make place for new ones.
Therefore, if you haven&#39;t looked at this folder yet, you are all 
very welcome to do it as soon as possible.

Happy birding to all,

Itai
