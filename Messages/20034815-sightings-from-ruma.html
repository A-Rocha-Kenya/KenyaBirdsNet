  <pre>A few sightings from a wet and soggy Ruma National Park, Suba District

African crake, black coucal, rufous-chested swallow, fawn-breasted waxbill, marsh tchagra. There were several huge flocks, some of maybe three to four thousand birds,  of what I took to be Abdim&#39;s storks circling very high overhead.
