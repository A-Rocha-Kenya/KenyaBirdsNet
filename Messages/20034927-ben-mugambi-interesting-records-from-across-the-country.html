  <pre>Dear All,

In the course of my Feb -March trip with clients by the names 
Gretchen Scholtz and Tomas Guindon (Tour Leader at Costa Rica) we saw 
a number of interesting species.

Over first week of March, we saw one Adult Eurasian Wryneck at 
Narumoru River Lodge, pretty close that we did not even need to use 
binoculars. We had a wonderful time looking at it for over 20 
minutes, looking quite tame!

At Mountain Rock Lodge (Bantu Lodge) they have a big dam behind the 
lodge and there was two pairs of African Black Duck, relatively easy 
to see as they are not that shy! (I have seen them here for a couple 
of times and I presume that they should be there even now!)

At Kilaguni Lodge-Tsavo West National Park, we saw a spectacular 
breeding male Standard-Winged Nightjar flying around the water hole. 
To make the matter worse, it has a habit of flying to the floodlight 
to catch insects and that give&#39;s you a really strong look of it. It 
is suprising how far from the depicted habitat (western Kenya) and 
this makes me believe that most of these unusually seen species could 
be existing in a couple of places.

On the game drive in two different times, we saw what we strongly 
believe was a Somali-Golden-Breasted Bunting (a pair each time). 
Looking at the adult, we managed to pick up the grey rump, bright 
golden yellow below, with white flanks and having been recorded an 
African Golden-Breasted Bunting at Narumoru, these was a good 
comparison. 

Also we saw a pair of Green Pigeon nesting at the tree right out of 
the Main Lodge entrance, an easy super view! There were two pairs of 
Black-Bellied Starlings at the Kilaguni compound and more amazing in 
different intervals a Little Yellow Flycatcher. It is suprising to 
see the Little Yellow Flycatcher here a couple of kilometers from 
where it is known to occur at the coast. We managed to see them 
through a Swarovski Telescope AT80/AT80 HD, and picked up the 
features very well.
