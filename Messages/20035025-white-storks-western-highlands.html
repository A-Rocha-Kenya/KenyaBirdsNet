  <pre>Dear All,
Further to Itai&#39;s report of large flocks in Central Kenya...

Here around Eldoret there are many hundreds of white storks feeding in the
harvested wheat fields and freshly ploughed fields. I sighted a large flock
flying in a long &#39;ribbon&#39; about 10-15 birds in breadth that seemed to
stretch from the centre of the sky directly above for several miles towards
the horizon. This was above Sergiot Hill north of Eldoret, about half-way to
Iten.

Greetings to all for the holidays and happy birding!
Dino
