  <pre>Just to alert you all that these flagged birds may be along the Kenya coast. This msg in today from Tony Tree in SA.

Far too few of us have the oportunity to take a close look at this species as they rarely (never !!) come inshore or roost on the mainland. However, some of you are lucky enough to get down to the coast occasionally and onto those off shore islets and sandbars.

Tony Tree has been ringing and flaging birds in SA and Mocambique for a while now. This msg just in from him.

&#34;&#34; Two requests: firstly could you let me have details of the other breeding record for 2003 that is mentioned and secondly, could you please ask membership (in Tanzania especially) to be on the look-out for ringed and flagged birds. The flags are on the leg opposite to the ring (whether right or left) and may be green (left or right), light blue (left) and white (left). These Darvic flags are conspicuous in the field. If you are particularly interested I can forward a pdf copy of my recent paper in Ostrich on this bird.  &#34;&#34;
