  <pre>Dear All

A brief visit to Naivasha on Sunday 12th October produced a single Great
Crested Grebe at the KWS Hippo picnic-site (I think that Shailesh Patel also
saw one here earlier in the year).

With the current high water levels, there is a lot of good marshland
habitat, both at KWS and at Burch&#39;s campsite, which looks well worth
checking out, although we did not see anything unusual. 

African Water  Rail is currently very easy to see (without a tape) in the
marsh at Burch&#39;s campsite.

Good Birding

Richard and Anne Bishop
