  <pre>Hello Everyone,

On 3rd April 2003,i was birding around Udo&#39;s camp and saw possible a female Semi-Collared Flycatcher on the edge of the forest.
I saw the bird less than a minute and flew away.It was bigger and heavy in size than Af. Dusky Flycatcher this is just tocompare. It had a white patch near the shoulder and had a white on outertail feathers which would reach to the tip of the tail. As the bird flew away the outertail feathers looked like of a Honeyguide. So is it possible it could be a Semi-Collared Flycatcher?.

Shailesh.
