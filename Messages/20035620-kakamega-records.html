  <pre>Dear all,

Shailesh Patel and Bernd de Bruijn spent a few days in Kakamega forest 
reserve (Isecheno), and perhaps the following records are worth mentioning: 
a pair of Yellow-bellied Wattle-eyes was found some distance northeast of 
the forest rest house; while recording their song, a Buff-spotted Flufftail 
gave a very brief glimpse while skulking over the forest floor (another was 
heard from the rest house, very early morning). In the same general area, an 
African Broadbill was displaying and a pair of Blue-headed Bee-eaters was 
present. Another Broadbill was found in Yala reserve, where also two 
Chapin&#39;s Flycatchers came in to a Red-chested Owlet tape, always staying 
right up in the canopy and calling continuously. Also in Yala reserve, a 
&#39;live&#39; Red-chested Owlet was heard, and Little Grey Greenbuls seem to be 
rather common there. The well-known pumphouse trail proved best for Great 
Blue Turaco (5-7 birds), and a male Eastern Bronze-naped Pigeon there was a 
comparitively rare sight.

Another mention should be made of the Stonechats around Kapsabet (the larger 
swamp along the C39 road) with black wings and apparently lacking any red, 
initially reported by Brian Finch and Itai Shanni. In April, Bernd saw a 
similar Stonechat in Kalunya glade in Kakamega forest, on which a small 
white wing-patch was only visible in flight. Is this just local variation or 
might there be more to it? It would be interesting to pay attention to 
Stonechats when visiting this area.

Good birding and greetings,

Shailesh Patel
Bernd de Bruijn
