&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; Bernd&#39;s recent note promted me to write a reply. 
&gt; Although I haven&#39;t been in 
&gt; Kenya since 1995 I birded the Loresho Ridge Swamp
&gt; regularly in the early 
&gt; 90&#39;s.  I have also seen Madagascar Squacco Heron
&gt; there as well as other 
&gt; interesting birds such as Northern Anteater Chat,
&gt; African Stonechat and if 
&gt; my memory serves me correctly, Yellow-crowned
&gt; Canary.  During years when 
&gt; water levels were higher there, it was also an
&gt; excellent place to see Purple 
&gt; Swamphen.
&gt;
