  <pre>Hello Birders,
                   During the Wed.morning birdwalk on 8th September which was led by Fleur Ng&#39;weno, we went to the Nairobi Arboretum and saw a male African Golden Oriole. In the checklist of the birds of Nairobi by Bill Harvey, the Oriole is not recorded as seen at the Arboretum. In the birds of Kenya and Northern Tanzania it mentions present mainly April - August, but it was still present. So do you think it was on it&#39;s way back and are there any other records of this species seen at the Arboretum ?.
                         Bye,
                                Shailesh
