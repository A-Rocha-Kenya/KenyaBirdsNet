  <pre>Dear Birders,
Just a line to let you that in the Mara especially along the Talek River,
there has in the past week been a few sightings of the migrant blackcap
warblers with no less than 5 birds seen in a day around Mara Intrepids
camp. The Caspian plovers are still around with more birds around Rhino
ridge and Burrungat plains.
Regards
