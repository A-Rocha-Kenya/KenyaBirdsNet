  <pre>    These come a little after the ringing at Ngulia is over (end of Dec) with a total of 
    19,160 birds ringed. We thought these records would be of interest to those who 
    receive this email listing.

Ringing took place at Ngulia in Tsavo West NP as usual over the new moons in
    November from 15th Nov to 6th Dec and again from 20-30 December. There 
    were a few real surprises in terms of species caught - amazing that after 35 
    years we are still catching new species for the list there! We also caught 3 
    Marsh Warblers with foreign rings on (termed &#39;controls&#39; in ringing jargon) from 
    the Czech Republic, Germany and Sweden. There were also some interesting 
    observations:

    Hobby and over 140 Eurasian Rollers. Another 110 Amurs pased west over 
    lodge at 0600 on 3rd Dec
