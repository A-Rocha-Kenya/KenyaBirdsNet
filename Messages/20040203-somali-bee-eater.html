  <pre>Britton (1980) mentions that this species was extending it&#39;s range southwards.

Does anyone know if this range expansion has continued ?

Where are the southernmost breeding localities for this bird ? The Kenya Atlas does not show any south of the Equator, is this still the case ?

thanks
