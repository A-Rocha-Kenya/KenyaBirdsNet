  <pre>The only record for White-throated Swallow (H. albigularis) in East Africa is give in Britton (1980) as a specimen collected over Lake Jipe on the border with Kenya on 25 July 1957.

Does anyone know the reference for this statement and the whereabouts of the specimen. We want to document additional sightings and would like to quote the reference for this first record.

appologies for cross posting

thanks
Neil
