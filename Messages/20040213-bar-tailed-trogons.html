  <pre>Dear All
Just spent a couple of days in Kakamega Forest. lots of rain- and three
different sightings of bar-tailed trogons feeding on winged termite alates
in the mid- to lower forest canopy. One pair was on the main trail to the
Buyangu Hill, another group of three (a pair with an almost fully grown
youngster) just off the main road between Rondo and the junction to the
tarmac and one more sighted in the forest along the Yala River. Blue headed
bee-eaters seen along the road and black-billed turaco calling in fruiting
trees overhead on the Yala River trail.

Closer to Eldoret, large groups of Southern Pochard on small dams around
Sergoit Hill and groups of crowned cranes abundant on freshly ploughed
fields.

Cheers
Dino
