&#34;We travel together on a little space ship,
dependent upon its vulnerable reserves of air and soil,
committed for our safety to its security and peace,
preserved from annihilation only by the care, the work,
and I will say, the love we give our fragile craft&#34;

Adlai Stevenson 1900-1968, US Statesman
