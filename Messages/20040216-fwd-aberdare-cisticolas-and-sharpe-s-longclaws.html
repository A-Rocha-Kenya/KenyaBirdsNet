  <pre>Dear all,

i got the following from Mr. Eric Harris

&gt; Dear Itai,
&gt; 
&gt; I have been up to Keresoi Dam this morning and am
&gt; glad to report that the whole area is in pretty good
&gt; shape. There is some extra farming going on in one
&gt; area to the south of the dam and across the fence
&gt; but there is still a large area which remains
&gt; relatively untouched. 
&gt; The even better news is that there were sevearl
&gt; sightings of Aberdare Cisticola - some from very
&gt; close range. Also present were Sharpe&#39;s Longclaw -
&gt; in very respectable numbers.
&gt; 
&gt; Other birds of note
&gt; 
&gt; Wing Snapping Cisticola
&gt; Northern Pintail
&gt; African Snipe
&gt; Black Winged Plover
&gt; Red Capped Lark
