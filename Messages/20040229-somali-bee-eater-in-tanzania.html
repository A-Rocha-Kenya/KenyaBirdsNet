  <pre>Hi everyone

The only record for Somali Bee-eater in Tanzania is given in Britton (1980) as an observation 10 km north of Dar es Salaam in November 1970.

I have been unable to trace the origin of this record.

If anyone on these lists knows the original reference I would much appreciate hearing from them.

Many thanks
Neil
