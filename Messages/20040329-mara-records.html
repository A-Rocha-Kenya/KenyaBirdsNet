Many migrants arrived with the current rains. Out on the plains, flocks of 
White and Abdim&#39;s Storks,  Caspian Plovers and Yellow Wagtails. Both 
Montagu&#39;s and Pallid Harriers are very common and many Kori Bustards are 
displaying. Many Steppe Eagles and a couple of Lesser Spotted Eagles and 
Common Kestrels.

The bush around Governors&#39; Camp is alive with Blackcaps (singing!) with a 
few Willow and Olivaceous Warblers and several Irania.

In the Musiara Swamp, Woolly-necked and Open-billed Storks and Spur-winged 
Geese are in residence.

Breeding records: Cinnamon-chested Bee-eaters -  3 pairs using nest holes 
in the bank of the Mara River, Governors&#39; Camp.
Blue Flycatcher -  several nests, Governors&#39; Camp.
