Good to hear of large groups of Southern Pochard and Grey Crowned Cranes but it would be even better to have actual numbers and names of the wetlands / sites.  Several sites for SP in East Africa reach 1% population levels and Grey Crowned Cranes are in all sorts of trouble from the international bird trade so known numbers of this species are especially welcome.
