&gt;
&gt;Hi Carol: Would you send this on to Kenya Bird Report. Thank you.
&gt;                                                    Following  is a brief
&gt; report of some exciting birds seen on 14-16 April in Tsavo East Nat. Park.
&gt; Within 10 km of Buchuma Gate a group of 8 Amur Falcons were seen in one
&gt; tree. At first a single female was seen and than she flew to the others,
&gt; some in the tree and others flying about. We had  about 5 minute look at
&gt; close range. Seen on the Voi River road east of Aruba Dam about 8 km in
&gt; shade of a bush, a pair of Violet-tipped Coursers, also about a dozen
&gt; Temmicks Coursers at signpost entrance to Satao Camp, where there is
&gt; extensive bushed plain. After many years of birding in Kenya, and looking
&gt; for Fire-fronted Bishops, and never seeing, over these 3 days estimate 200
&gt; males seen along road from Buchuma to Aruba, and sporadically throughout
the
&gt; park. Among many Common Cuckoos, African Cuckoos--?, was one Levaillants.
&gt; Violet Woodhoopoe was another good bird for me, a group along Voi River.
&gt; These were among 100 species seen during this trip. Thank you for reports
&gt; you send me. My email while in Kenya is cjhimes@hotmail.com  Thank you
&gt; Duncan Himes of Mombasa
