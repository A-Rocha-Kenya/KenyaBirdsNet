  <pre>Dear Birders,

The rains in almost all over the country have brought
good species mainly the rain migrants.

On Saturday 1st of May, I spent my Labour Day birding
with Duncan Himes of Mombasa and his friend Erastus
Kadu. We had a good time despite the whole day rains.
At first our idea was to visit Mark Harries Juja Farm,
but the weather was terrible and so we decided to
visit Kieni Forest through Thika � Kinagop grasslands
route. There is very good birding along this route and
especially a time like now when there lots of marshy
pools. 2 kms along this road from Thika Road, we saw a
pair of Grey- olive Greenbul (nice to see that they
are common here) and also in one pool there was a pair
of Spur-winged goose.

Kieni Forest was very productive with several highland
species including        Bar-tailed Trogon, but most
interesting thing is there were a lot of African Hill
Babblers. Almost every bird hoping out of the bush, a
quick shout; Hill Babbler! A stopover at Kinagop
grasslands along this road few kilometers to Nairobi �
Kinagop road fly over was productive with Sharpe�s
Longclaw, but more interestingly the grasslands are
full of Black-winged plovers. 

Winding up the day at Roslyne River Flower Garden next
to Village Market, we were surprised to see a pair of
African Black Ducks perching on the stone -wall. I
passed there on Sunday 2nd May and I saw them again �
I�ve got some very good digiscoping photos!

Wishing you a nice rain birding!

Ben Mugambi
