  <pre>Jambo Birders,

Since when I saw Mark Mallalieu�s article about
Endashant Swamps, behind Ngong Hills and Nature
Kenya�s pot luck visits report, I have always wanted
to visit this wonderful swamp.

Yesterday 9th of May, Shailesh, some non-birders
friends and me decided to see how it is down there
after the rains. We saw a couple of dry land birds
found around this area, but the swamps were not very
productive.

The grass is very tall, though there is water all over
and none of the commonly seen Crakes or Bishops
considering that the conditions at the moment are
exceptionally suitable. It�s only the secretive Dwarf
Bitten, which gave us a surprise sight. Has anyone in
this group been there recently? Has somebody seen the
Striped Crake and Baillon�s Crake there recently?

We thought that if one can go here with gumboots and
walk across the swamp or may be side by side, but in
the swamp you stand some chances of spotting some of
this elusive species. We are planning for another
visit soon!

Happy Birding to all!

Thanks, 

Ben Mugambi.
