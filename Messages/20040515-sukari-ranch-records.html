  <pre>Dear Birdwatchers,

On Thursday 13th May, we spent the whole afternoon
birding at Sukari Ranch � Brookside near Peponi School
with Duncan Himes and Tom Njaga (one of our wildlife
safari guides). Although it was in the afternoon and
reasonably hot, like it has always been we saw some
good birds around Sukari Dam.

Interesting species here were 4 Broad-billed Rollers
and a flock of Cardinal Queleas that were feeding on
the tall grass around the area marked �pond 7�. We
also observed a very funny behavior with the Sedge
Warblers here, where they were feeding reasonably high
in Eucalyptus trees; a totally unbelievable behavior
for an Acrocephalus Warbler.

It is a shame to see that Sukari Dam has completely
been covered by water hyacinth in a period of the last
few months, such that no any open water left for even
a Little Grebe to swim!

On 14th of May, we spent the day again with Duncan
Himes and his fried Allan at Nairobi National Park.
The Park was reasonably quiet, but full of reasonable
flocks of Whydahs (pin- tailed), Widows (Red Collared
and White-winged), Common waxbills, Quail-finches and
Cardinal Queleas.

Happy birding!

Ben Mugambi.
