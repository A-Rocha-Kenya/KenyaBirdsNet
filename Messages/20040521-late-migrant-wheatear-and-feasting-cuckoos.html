  <pre>Greetings birders

Some records from recent Nature Kenya outings:

Pied Wheatear, male in brilliant breeding plumage, Olorgesailie Prehistoric
Site off Magadi Road, 16 May 2004, seen by Nature Kenya Sunday Birdwatch.
Also Great Spotted Cuckoo.

Two Ayres&#39; Hawk-Eagles soaring and diving above the Nairobi Arboretum, 19
May 2004, seen by Nature Kenya Wednesday Morning Birdwalk.  Participants
also noted two cyclical events: An outbreak of caterpillars in the Croton
trees, attracting various cuckoos to feast on them; and a gorgeous flowering
of Craibia brownii trees, with sweetly-scented pea-type blossoms.

Good birding,

Fleur
