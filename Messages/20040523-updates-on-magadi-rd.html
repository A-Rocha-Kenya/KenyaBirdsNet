  <pre>Dear all,

here are few updates from Magadi Rd. coming from Brian Finch from 
last Friday (21/05/04).

&#34;... I Went down Magadi Road last Friday but did not get off the 
hill.

Species we had not seen on the last trips there were Great Spotted 
Cuckoo, Wahlberg&#39;s Honeybird, Bare-eyed Thrush, Steel-blue 
Whydah...&#34; 

(so now all Whydaha&#39;s were seen there in the last 2 weeks, IS).

Happy birding to all,
Itai
