  <pre>Dear All,

On May 29th my friend Andrew Kamiti and I decided to
explore some nice birding hotspots of the Kenya coast.
The main purpose for the tour was to do a little bit
of pelagic tour, Dolphin watching at Shimoni and also
visit Tana River Primate National Reserve.

On 30th we joined other clients booked for Dolphin
watching excursion by the Diani Dolphin Dhow. The main
aim for joining this group was to cheaply have a ride
while trying to look for the birds �found in the first
plate numbers of our birds of East Africa Guidebooks�
and off course the Dolphins.

We had a wonderful experience though with very few
birds with mainly a few Greater, Lesser Crested and
White-cheeked Terns. The Kisite Island was full of
Dimorphic Egrets probably a hundred plus, together
with a few Sacred Ibis. It�s really windy at the coast
now and even that day we were just lucky that things
worked out well. 

None of the special gulls apart from the common Sooty
Gull or any of the other interesting species. The Dhow
Captains said that the best time for the ocean birds
here would be between August-March-September and
October- April. The Black winged Red Bishop and
Zanzibar Bishop along Funzi paddy fields are in full
breeding plumage now!
