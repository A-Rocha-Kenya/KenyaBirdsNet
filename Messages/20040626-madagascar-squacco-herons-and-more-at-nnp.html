  <pre>Dear all,

Today (26th June) together with Chege Kariuki at
Nairobi NP not much was found. never the less a few
interesting observation were made;

coming down to Athi basin a lone Rosy-breasted
Longclaw was spotted. later down at the lower plains
another 3 were seen but these had more of their
breeding plumage still.

at the Dam itself (Athi) a Gull-billed Tern was flying
over the water and one summer plumage Greenshank was
eating on the SE tip of the dam - what does it still
do here??

down at Hippo pools we had a great view of both male
and female African Finfoot; the male just near the car
park and the female at the tip of the path.

The most interesting record though was of the highest
concentration that i ever witnessed around NBi of
Madagascar Squacco Herons. at Hyena dam at least 5
were seen and most probably more are there (as we did
not look all around it). also at this dam a female
African Darter, this species is not very common in the
park and one lone Purple Swamphen (another locally
uncommon species).

happy birding to all,
Itai
