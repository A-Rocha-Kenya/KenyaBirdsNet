  <pre>Hello Birders,

On 11 July i went birding with Gihan who is a new birdwatcer to Nairobi N.P. The weather was not so good for birds,as it was cold and misty. We didn&#39;t see any Nairobi Pipit but lots of Cisticolas (difficult to know from each other). By the afternoon, we were at Hippo Pools where we saw 2 Giant Kingfishers and an adult female African Finfoot with a young one who looked smaller and had a black bill. It seems that the Finfoot have breed along the river. does anybody know of other breeding records of A. Finfoot along this river (not just regular records)?
Bye,
Shailesh.
