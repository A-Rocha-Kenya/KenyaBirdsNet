  <pre>Greetings Birders

While participating in the mid-year Waterbird Count at Lake Nakuru organised
by the National Museums of Kenya, Kenya Wildlife Service and Nature Kenya on
July 11, we had an interesting sighting.  We were at the south end near the
mouth of the Makalia River, and saw a group of Kittlitz&#39;s Plovers
beautifully camouflaged on the trampled, dark mud frosted with white soda.

Beyond them were two other small plovers, considerably larger than the
Kittlitz&#39;s, with much longer legs and heavier beak.  They were foraging in
stop-and-go plover fashion, but rather slowly.  From above, they were dull
brownish in colour.  One had a very slight, pale orange band on the chest,
the other a dull, broken brown band.  Lesser (Mongolian) Sand Plovers!

Other migrants (or oversummering birds) noted were White-winged Terns in
brilliant black and white plumage, Gull-billed Terns, Marsh Sandpipers and a
Common Greenshank.  We counted about equal numbers of Great White Pelicans
and Lesser Flamingoes in our section.  A surprise the previous day, July 10,
were two Grey Crowned Cranes at Njoro River mouth.

Best wishes,

Fleur
