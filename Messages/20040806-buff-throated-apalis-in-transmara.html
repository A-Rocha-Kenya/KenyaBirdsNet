  <pre>Dear all
I&#39;ve been in Mara Game Reserve and the area around the
Olololoo Escarpment on the reserve boundary in
Transmara. For two weeks (18-31 July) I had a few
birds worth reporting   
The most interesting record was Buff-throated Apalis
in a stretchy Esiket Forest approx. 5km from the Mara
Game Reserve on the same escarpment. This is a range
extension (over 100km south of Kakamega) since the
Zimmerman records the species only in Mt Elgon,
Kakamega, Nandi forests and formerly in Mumias.  
Another interesting thing is that the species is also
breeding in this forest. It was a female (with tawny
throat and breast, black head throughout the back and
white under tail feather) feeding a fledged youngone
(no tawny-throat) under canopy in the presence of Grey
Cuckoo-Shrike, Common Bulbul and an Oriole with a
black head though wasnï¿½t luck to see the upper tail.
Presumably, the Black-headed. Watched the apalis for
about 4-5min.  
These forests are in really in good condition with
less disturbance since walking for about 8km through
the forest never came across a single charcoal kiln
but several cut tree. It&#39;s a good example of community
preserved forest. Much of disturbance might be near
the Lolgorian town. The future possible threat is the
uprising of the maize farming in the forest glades.
These might bring the need to clear for farming
extensions. Already clearing has been done but very
little/minimal. 
Back to records 
3 individuals of the Red-tailed/Familiar Chat on the
Olololoo Escarpment near the former AT&amp;H and dead
Olkurruk Lodge
A Silverbird near the Mara River Camp but said to
occur from Keekorok (south Mara GR) south to
Serengeti. 

Another tragic story worth reporting is a case of
massive poisoning of vultures in the area. I never
witnessed but heard from the locals. A farmer had his
goats/sheep killed by a leopard, poisoned some of the
carcasses and the result were death of hyenas and 40+
vulture. Very disgusted owner of the goats/sheep that
the leopard never died. This happened between Fed or
March as they say. Something needs to be done in
raising the awareness to the locals about this. A
well-fenced goat/sheep/cattle homestead keeping off
the leopard, lion etc.

For reptile lovers a Lake Rukwa Sand Snakes on the
same forest glades which is again not know from this
are. In Kenya know only in Kaimosi.

Good luck &amp; spotting
