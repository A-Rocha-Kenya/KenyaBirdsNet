  <pre>Greetings birders

Nature Kenya&#39;s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk recorded a variety of birds around
the constructed wetlands at Splash, Langata, on 18 August 2004.

Most startling was a Black Crake with one white wing.  All the primaries on
one wing were entirely white.  This time, all the participants had a good
view.  Some time ago, we had briefly glimpsed a Black Crake with two white
wings at the same site.  We also saw two Brown Parrots.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
