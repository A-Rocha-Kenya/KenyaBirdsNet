  <pre>&gt; Dear All,
&gt; 
&gt; On 28th August, I went up to Nakuru to see if there
&gt; was any hope that the Slender-billed Gull seen by
&gt; Steven Easley would still be there after he had
&gt; found it 25 days before.
&gt; 
&gt; I waited at the mouth of the Njoro River, the river
&gt; was very full, and was attracting many gulls and
&gt; terns where it spilt out into the lake. Searching
&gt; amongst the numerous Grey-headed Gulls, there were
&gt; two adult Black-headed, and it was not long to wait
&gt; before the adult Slender-bill was doing its
&gt; ablutions with them. This individual is a nice
&gt; adult, complete with pinkish hue, and was duly
&gt; digitised. Having attained the objective very early
&gt; in the proceedings, this allowed a leisurely full
&gt; day around the lake.
&gt; 
&gt; In spite of being early in the season, there were
&gt; many thousands of Ruffs around the lake, also
&gt; considerable numbers of Little Stints but barely
&gt; half-a-dozen Curlew Sandpipers, there must have been
&gt; a over a thousand Marsh Sandpipers scattered around,
&gt; but probably no more than fifteen Greenshank, three
&gt; Wood, one Green and six Common Sandpipers. There was
&gt; one Black-tailed Godwit in the reedy corner below
&gt; Baboon Cliffs, and the only three Ringed Plover,
&gt; were all in the south-eastern corner. White-winged
&gt; Black Terns amounted to what seemed like tens of
&gt; thousands, there were vast numbers all over the
&gt; lake, but there must have been well over a thousand
&gt; Whiskered which is a high number. Five Avocets only,
&gt; and they in the south-east corner, but large numbers
&gt; of Black-winged Stilts all around the shore. Below
&gt; Baboon Cliffs there were two Western Reef Herons,
&gt; they looked just like the ones that were in the same
&gt; place last January. One dark Dimorphic Egret near
&gt; Hippo Picnic Site on the eastern shore. There was an
&gt; early adult male Marsh Harrier there as well. Two
&gt; flocks amounted to well over one-hundred Cape
&gt; Wigeon, and apart from these there were birds all
&gt; around the lake. In July I struggled to find Greater
&gt; Flamingo, finally locating two! Now they are in
&gt; unusual numbers especially the marsh pools below
&gt; Baboon Cliffs and in the east shore marshes. Some
&gt; groups amount to several hundred birds. Only one
&gt; raft of fifteen Black-necked Grebes seen all day,
&gt; and as yet no migrant duck.
&gt; 
&gt; One sub-adult Saddle-billed Stork along the eastern
&gt; side, where Great Egrets were in large numbers in
&gt; the marsh, but the concentration of Yellow-billed
&gt; Egrets is unusual for the species. Glossy Ibis in
&gt; good numbers and a few strange creamy birds amongst
&gt; them.
&gt; 
&gt; Probably over a thousand Barn Swallows around the
&gt; shore, and Angola Swallow near Muyas Causeway,
&gt; something I seem to see every time now, whereas I am
&gt; sure I did not see them before. The same goes for
&gt; Blue-spotted Wood Dove, which was along the western
&gt; road, and again I see it on every visit nowadays,
&gt; but cannot ever remember the bird in the past. Bush
&gt; birds were very prominent and noisy, being active
&gt; all through the morning. African and Black Cuckoos
&gt; were calling, the place is having a spring, with
&gt; much nesting activity, following the recent
&gt; persistent rains. 
&gt; 
&gt; The strangest bird of the day, I cannot yet
&gt; positively identify. There has been a large die-off
&gt; of Lesser Flamingos, and this has attracted unusual
&gt; numbers of Pied Crows to the foreshore along the
&gt; northern end. Amongst these crows I found a strange
&gt; black corvid. The bird was slightly heavier than the
&gt; Pied Crows that fed with it, the bill was very
&gt; heavy, but not razor-narrow like in Fan-tailed and
&gt; White-necked Ravens. The outer tail feathers were
&gt; only slightly shorter than the wing projection.
&gt; However the bird was all black, apart from a tracing
&gt; of white around the shoulders, and a gorget of very
&gt; irregular white spots, from the bend of the wing
&gt; across the belly. The upperparts were entirely
&gt; black, and very glossy. My first thought was a
&gt; hybrid Pied Crow/Fan-tailed Raven, but if the Pied
&gt; Crow provided the weakest genes, as testified by the
&gt; lack of white on the back, little white on the
&gt; belly, then why would the tail be the length of a
&gt; Pied Crow, and the short tail not be present if
&gt; Fan-tailed Raven were the dominant influence. I then
&gt; thought of hybrid Pied Crow/Brown-necked Raven, now
&gt; more correctly called Somali Crow. But there was no
&gt; brownish cast to the head, and a Somali Crow would
&gt; be strange enough this far south, let alone it being
&gt; a hybrid with Pied Crow. On two occasions the bird
&gt; called loudly, and it was a perfect Pied Crow,
&gt; however to my ears I cannot tell any difference
&gt; between Pied Crow and Somali Crow anyway. The call
&gt; no way suggested Fan-tailed or White-necked Ravens.
&gt; I took many photographs of the bird with its Pied
&gt; Crow friends, but they do not provide any further
&gt; clues. The hackle patterns might assist a crow fundi
&gt; though. In Ethiopia I have seen something similar
&gt; with hybrid Pied Crow and Somali Crow, the two forms
&gt; are extremely close, the Somali Crow is just like an
&gt; all black Pied Crow! Somali Crow also have white
&gt; bases to the black feathering where this would be
&gt; white in a Pied Crow, and when the feathers are
&gt; ruffled, the white bases show.
&gt; 
&gt; Had this bird not have had these white patches, I
&gt; would have been sure that the bird was a rather lost
&gt; Somali Crow. Anyone interested is welcome to see the
&gt; pictures.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; On the afternoon of the 29th August, I went down to
&gt; Olorgesailie with Richard and Anne Bishop, we had
&gt; booked in at the Bandas. There are new bandas,
&gt; replacing those burnt down at the beginning of the
&gt; year. Comfortable mattresses, pillows and a mosquito
&gt; net are provided, and they are very comfortable. We
&gt; drove out to Emerit on the road out of Ol Tepesi,
&gt; the aim was to go and find Freckled Nightjars, then
&gt; spotlight along the road back to Olorgesailie. On
&gt; the evening drive we found Bare-eyed Thrush, Tiny
&gt; Cisticola, Southern Grosbeak Canary, and before the
&gt; sun had set we arrived at the base of the lava
&gt; cliff. Just after the sun had set, Richard played
&gt; tape of Freckled Nightjar, and was answered almost
&gt; immediately. I had always thought Freckled to be
&gt; fairly unresponsive until this night. A bird circled
&gt; us and flew back to sing from the cliff. We played
&gt; again, and it came in again and circled us.
&gt; Eventually it flew down to the sandy area by the
&gt; creek, where it was joined by a second bird. We
&gt; drove down and sat in the car, with the birds
&gt; sitting on the sand not too far away. We wanted to
&gt; try for some photographs, but it was proving
&gt; difficult, as by now it was quite dark, although a
&gt; full moon rising. We tried playing tape a little
&gt; further along the road, and a bird flew in and
&gt; disappeared although it was calling quite loudly.
&gt; Richard said he thought it had landed on the roof of
&gt; the car, I climbed out through the window, glancing
&gt; at the tree above me, where there was no sign of the
&gt; bird, then looked on the roof, and the bird was two
&gt; feet away, but naturally was a shocked as I was and
&gt; flew off. We played tape again, and the bird flew
&gt; straight in and just sat. calling five feet from the
&gt; car, where it remained challenging the invisible
&gt; interloper.
&gt; 
&gt; We left the birds and spotlighted along the road, by
&gt; now the moon was high and it was like daylight, and
&gt; the only birds we found were two Spotted Thick-knees
&gt; and four Slender-tailed Nightjars. 
&gt; 
&gt; Back at the bandas, the moonlight was encouraging
&gt; many birds to give voice, Buff-crested Bustards were
&gt; particularly noisy, Heuglin&#39;s Coursers were giving
&gt; their descending calls and the to date undocumented,
&gt; disjunct local population of Donaldson-Smith&#39;s
&gt; Nightjar (which are resident along the Magadi Road)
&gt; were also making their presence known. After a late
&gt; dinner we decided to try and locate the closest one.
&gt; Setting off just with mag-lites and no recording
&gt; equipment, nor photographic equipment, we headed in
&gt; the direction of the bird. After several periods of
&gt; bird calling  then periods of silence, we finally
&gt; located it sitting under a bush. We went closer, and
&gt; it sat there seemingly oblivious to us, we went
&gt; closer and closer, until we were at the closest
&gt; limit of the focus of the binoculars and nothing to
&gt; immortalise the experience! It sat there in all it&#39;s
&gt; beautiful spottiness, and we walked away still
&gt; leaving it in place, and when we were at a little
&gt; distance it started singing again (and continued
&gt; virtually all night!). On the way back we found a
&gt; Nyika Gecko next to the track, which was new for all
&gt; of us.
&gt; 
&gt; On Sunday morning there was much activity at the
&gt; bandas, the bird-bath was brimming with birds, a
&gt; good variety with Crimson-rumped Waxbills being the
&gt; most numerous species. All of the usual estrildids
&gt; were present, with exception of whydahs, with no
&gt; species present. The only unusual sighting here were
&gt; two Levaillant&#39;s Cuckoos. 
&gt; 
&gt; Stopping off at a lugga on the escarpment on the
&gt; return, we found four White Helmetshrikes including
&gt; one immature. We were going to climb the hill at
&gt; Kisamese to look for butterflies, and not
&gt; disappointed with two Hutchinson&#39;s Silver-Spots that
&gt; have to be seen to believe what stunning beauties
&gt; they are- unlike the dowdy illustration in Larsen.
&gt; However, we had parked in Ribs Village (just before
&gt; Kisamese), and on return found a pair of Bush Pipits
&gt; living in the garden. They were very tame, and took
&gt; no notice of the passing human traffic, or the
&gt; dogs.... and finally posed in a tree to be
&gt; immortally digitised. Anyone popping into Ribs for a
&gt; beverage or nyama choma, should keep an eye out for
&gt; these trusting birds. Never a dull day on the Magadi
&gt; Road.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Best to all
&gt; 
&gt; Brian
