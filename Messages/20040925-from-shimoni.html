  <pre>Hi everyone,
I have been away for 3.5 months having my cataracts operated on ( I 
can now see really well) and a double hip replacement, so can now get 
around much better.
We have had some interesting birds in the garden due to the very dry 
conditions here I think. Pat saw a Wedge Tailed Shearwater, on the 
Pemba side of the Pemba Channel on the 16th Sept., and on the 18th 
September there were 3 Yellowbills in the tree beside the beach by 
our guesthouse. This is the first time I have seen Yellowbills for 
over ten years in the garden.
We have had Dark-backed Weavers, Green Barbets, Red-Capped Robin 
Chats and Paradise Flycatchers coming to the bird bath, which is 
unusual. We normally have them in the garden but not at the bird 
bath. This morning they had a problem with the bird bath and wouldn&#39;t 
come down to it, and the bulbuls were shouting their heads off, so I 
went to investigate and found a young python curled up in it. A very 
pretty chap about three feet long. We gently persuaded him to move, 
and he eventually did and went down to the ground and curled up under 
one of the desert roses, but has since moved!
I had to go up to Diani yesterday 24th Sept, and there were a lot of 
carmine beeeaters along the telephone wires. I think this is a bit 
early for them as we usually have them here late October/November 
through to March.
Good Birding
Maia Hemphill
