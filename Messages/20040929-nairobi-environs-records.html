  <pre>Greetings

Despite the severe drought, the Wednesday Morning Birdwalks have observed
some interesting birds in the Nairobi area:

Grey Wagtail, Nairobi river at National Museums of Kenya, 15 September

Red-throated Wryneck, farm next to Ondiri Swamp, Kikuyu, 22 September

Madagascar Squacco Heron, small dam off Magadi Road in Langata, 29
September.

At the Thika Sewage Treatment Ponds on Sunday 19 September, we noted a
single Garganey.  As the other Palaearctic ducks had not yet arrived, I
wonder whether the Garganey oversummered at Thika?

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
