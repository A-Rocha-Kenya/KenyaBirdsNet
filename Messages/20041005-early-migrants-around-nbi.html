Dear all,

i just had a short 1/2 day around Nbi NP and Ngong Hills yesterday. 

there are not too many migrants around but still one can easily 
notice that things are moving. the 1st Whinchat for me this season 
was in the park and also Northern Wheatears and Isabeline Wheatears 
were common already. apart from these that were new for the season 
(for me anyway) some waders are also around; Marsh and Common 
Sandpipers, Little Stint and few Common Greenshanks.
i believe that it won&#39;t be long now, till the big numbers and more 
species will start popping out.

wish you all a very good migration season and hope to see more 
records of these migrants (or other interesting records) coming in 
for the list,

Itai
