Dear Caroline and other friends,
 Does anyone on the Kenyan side know what is happening about Lake 
Jipe? Is it a problem of lack of inflow, or is the lake silting up?
 Neil Baker says (14 October)
&gt; there still seems to be alot of water in the Ruvu that flows from 
Jipe to Nyumba ya Mungu so perhaps the problem is silting rather than 
overuse of water for irrigation? 
&gt; It would be really useful to have references for any reports on the 
state of play at Jipe. We should ask the kenyanbirdnet. Are any of 
you members as we have also lost access to that email group? &lt;
  Be glad if anyone can provide information please... Can you also 
please send your reply to;   tanzaniabirdnet@yahoogroups.com
 Asante sana,
 Chris Chandler
