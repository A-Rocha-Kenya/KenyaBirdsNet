Greetings birders

Nature Kenya&#39;s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk had another enjoyable morning at
&#34;Proposed Biodiversity Park&#34;, the hillside with rocky outcrops and seasonal
wetlands near Uhuru Gardens and the Carnivore Restaurant, on 3 November 04.
The parched hillside was covered with a thin down of green with a scattering
of flowers, and a few pools held water.  Records include:

Dwarf Bittern flying up into an acacia, clearly seen by the whole group

Nesting:
Crowned Plover, sitting on two large eggs on black cotton soil
Gabar Goshawk, a pair guarding a nest with at least two downy chicks, in an
acacia
Little Bee-eater, several pairs entering holes in low bank across from
Carnivore entrance
Brubru, sitting on well-camouflaged nest in fork in acacia tree
White-browed Sparrow-Weaver, flying up into nest with food in its beak

Migrants:
Barn Swallow
Yellow Wagtail
Sprosser
Northern Wheatear
Spotted Flycatcher
Red-backed Shrike

Wishing you good birding,

Fleur
