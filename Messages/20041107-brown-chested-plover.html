Dear Birders,
On the 30th October in the Masai Mara Game reserve, I was delighted 
to spot and photograph a Brown chested plover which was feeding 
among the wildebeest with a few Black winged plovers. The place was 
around the Paradise crossing point. I will post the pictures here as 
soon as I get them developed. My field guides shows it is vagrant 
and occurs in western Serengeti westwards.
I had earlier posted on this issue here but not sure if it went out.
