&gt; Dear John, Itai 
&gt; 
&gt; Further to your interest in Lake Jipe, I have just
&gt; been informed that the
&gt; 5km channel being dug back through the swamp to open
&gt; up the access to the
&gt; River Lumi has been just about completed, the water
&gt; is now flowing back into
&gt; Lake Jipe and the water levels are rising.      
&gt; Apparently there is fish in
&gt; plenty.   It would be interesting to see the
&gt; response amongst the bird
&gt; population.   When I was there in September, the
&gt; lake was 3/4  dry, the odd
&gt; Jacana were picking their way through the mud and
&gt; silt, lots of yellow bill
&gt; stork and some pelicans but not a sign of a pygmy
&gt; goose.   Fishing
&gt; activities were at rock bottom, tiny specimans were
&gt; being netted, the water
&gt; quality for drinking was appalling, it was taking 5
&gt; hours for a canoe crew
&gt; to negotiate their way across the lake through the
&gt; various channels (usually
&gt; takes 1 hour), animals were getting stuck in the mud
&gt; along the shore and
&gt; people were terrified of the elephants which were
&gt; coming out of the park
&gt; regularly.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone has a chance to go down there and assess
&gt; the situation, I would be
&gt; interested in their report as I don&#39;t think I will
&gt; be able to get for a
&gt; while.
