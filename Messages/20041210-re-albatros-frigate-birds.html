Hi everyone, two interesting sightings for you.

Pat saw two Shy Albatros off Mombasa about 8 miles out on the 
20th November 2004. One was circling quite close to the boats, 
and then he saw the second one which he thinks was a juvenile.

Then on the 2nd December while fishing in the middle of the 
Pemba Channel between Kenya (shimoni) and Pemba, he had a 
Frigate Bird persistently trying to take the strip bait they had out. It 
must have been a great sight. Pat checked the Seabirds Book 
when he got back and thinks it must have been an immature 
Greater Frigate because it had white on its head and a white patch 
on the breast. We don&#39;t see them very often here, but it was during 
that time that we had that cyclone off Somalia so may have been 
blown off track a bit.

The other fun thing we have had recently is a Woolly-Necked Stork 
coming in to the bird bath and having a good drink. They used to 
come, but haven&#39;t done so for a couple of years and it is good to 
see them again, or rather, just the one stork.

Regards and a Happy Christmas and New Year to everyone.
