Dear all,

as it&#39;s been so quiet from all of you out there lately (is it due to 
lack of migrants around???), i decided to send in this record, even 
though this species has become regularly reported in recent years.

yesterday while driving back to Nairobi, one bird was circling low 
about 5 Km W of Suswa police on the main Narok road.

it seems very poor up to now with the migrants around (not something 
i can say on neighboring Tanzania).

i hope that more records will come soon.

all the best,
Itai
