  <pre>&gt; Dear All,
&gt; 
&gt; I had the opportunity of spending two days in Mt.
&gt; Elgon National Park. I was not travelling with
&gt; birders, so the records are limited to a couple of
&gt; hours at Rongai Campsite in the mornings, and along
&gt; the road, right to the top of the roadhead.
&gt; Nevertheless it was very interesting, and a number
&gt; of good species were seen.
&gt; 
&gt; The road from the turn-off from the tarmac Kitale
&gt; Road is in excellent condition, and although dirt is
&gt; very smooth and takes only five to ten minutes to
&gt; the Park Entrance.
&gt; 
&gt; The Bandas were full, and the staff say that they
&gt; are becoming very popular now, and recommend that
&gt; any reservations should be directed at them, 
&gt; (menp@swiftkenya.com) and not KWS in Nairobi.
&gt; 
&gt; We only saw a couple of other campers during the two
&gt; days, but there were tourists taying at Mt. Elgon
&gt; Lodge, and daytrippers were coming in from Kitale.
&gt; 
&gt; The roads have been well maintained, although a
&gt; two-wheel drive might have problems getting up to
&gt; the alpine grassland.
&gt; 
&gt; The trails were remarkably birdy, although we were
&gt; not stopping on the way to the top, however in the
&gt; grassland we had three Montane  Francolins walking
&gt; towards us down the road, and I was so astonished at
&gt; having such good views of this species that I forgot
&gt; to photograph them.
&gt; 
&gt; We stayed in Rongai Campsite, beautifully located in
&gt; a grassy glade, with a river at the bottom. There
&gt; was a substantial amount of firewood already in
&gt; place, running water, cold showers, clean
&gt; long-drops, an open band-like grass-roofed kitchen
&gt; area, benches and table. But for birders the most
&gt; important would probably be the pair of extravert
&gt; Red-chested Owlets that leave the forest in the
&gt; evening to call noisily from the trees above the
&gt; kitchen. Their presence also makes birding much
&gt; easier because by imitating the calls the other
&gt; birds in the area come in to investigate. In the
&gt; short time in the campsite I recorded the following
&gt; species; AFRICAN BLACK DUCK. AFRICAN GOSHAWK.
&gt; EURASIAN BUZZARD. COMMON OLIVE PIGEON. DUSKY
&gt; TURTLE-DOVE. RED-EYED DOVE. BLUE-SPOTTED WOOD-DOVE.
&gt; TAMBOURINE DOVE. RED-FRONTED PARROT. ROSS&#39;S TURACO.
&gt; HARTLAUB&#39;S TURACO. RED-CHESTED OWLET. MONTANE
&gt; NIGHTJAR. SPECKLED MOUSEBIRD. CINNAMON-CHESTED
&gt; BEE-EATER. AFRICAN SCIMITARBILL. BLACK-AND-WHITE
&gt; CASQUED HORNBILL. GREY-THROATED BARBET.
&gt; YELLOW-SPOTTED BARBET. GOLDEN-RUMPED TINKERBIRD.
&gt; YELLOW-BILLED BARBET. FINE-BANDED WOODPECKER.
&gt; CARDINAL WOODPECKER. BARN SWALLOW. ANGOLA SWALLOW.
&gt; BLACK SAW-WING. GREY WAGTAIL. AFRICAN PIED WAGTAIL.
&gt; MOUNTAIN WAGTAIL. EURASIAN TREE PIPIT. GREY
&gt; CUCKOO-SHRIKE. AFRICAN BLACK CUCKOO-SHRIKE.
&gt; PURPLE-THROATED CUCKOO-SHRIKE. COMMON BULBUL.
&gt; YELLOW-WHISKERED GREENBUL. CABANIS GREENBUL.
&gt; NORTHERN PUFFBACK. BROWN-HEADED TCHAGRA. LUHDER&#39;S
&gt; BUSH-SHRIKE. TROPICAL BOUBOU. GREY-WINGED
&gt; GROUND-ROBIN. CAPE ROBIN-CHAT. NORTHERN OLIVE
&gt; THRUSH. CHUBB&#39;S CISTICOLA. BLACK-THROATED APALIS.
&gt; CHESTNUT-THROATED APALIS. GREY APALIS. GREY-BACKED
&gt; CAMAROPTERA. BROWN WOODLAND-WARBLER. WILLOW WARBLER.
&gt; BLACKCAP. WHITE-EYED SLATY FLYCATCHER. DUSKY
&gt; FLYCATCHER. SEMI-COLLARED FLYCATCHER. CHIN-SPOT
&gt; BATIS. BLACK-THROATED WATTLE-EYE. BLUE FLYCATCHER.
&gt; AFRICAN PARADISE-FLYCATCHER. WHITE-BREASTED TIT.
&gt; COLLARED SUNBIRD. OLIVE SUNBIRD. GREEN-THROATED
&gt; SUNBIRD. VARIABLE SUNBIRD. NORTHERN DOUBLE-COLLARED
&gt; SUNBIRD. AFRICAN YELLOW WHITE-EYE. STREAKY
&gt; SEEDEATER. THICK-BILLED SEEDEATER. GREY-HEADED
&gt; NEGRO-FINCH. YELLOW-BELLIED WAXBILL. BRONZE
&gt; MANNIKIN. BLACK-AND-WHITE MANAKIN. BAGLAFECHT
&gt; WEAVER. BROWN-CAPPED WEAVER. SHARPE&#39;S STARLING.  and
&gt; MONTANE ORIOLE.
&gt; 
&gt; Additionally along the roads and up to the
&gt; moorlands, the following were recorded;
&gt; 
&gt; AUGUR BUZZARD. CROWNED EAGLE. LANNER FALCON. MONTANE
&gt; FRANCOLIN. SCALY FRANCOLIN. CRESTED GUINEAFOWL.
&gt; WHITE-HEADED WOOD-HOOPOE. PLAIN MARTIN. RED-RUMPED
&gt; SWALLOW. GRASSLAND PIPIT. DOHERTY&#39;S BUSH-SHRIKE.
&gt; COMMON FISCAL. WHITE-STARRED ROBIN. RED-CAPPED
&gt; ROBIN-CHAT. STONECHAT. ALPINE CHAT. NORTHERN
&gt; ANTEATER CHAT. CINNAMON BRACKEN WARBLER. MOUNTAIN
&gt; YELLOW WARBLER. HUNTER&#39;S CISTICOLA. CHIFFCHAFF.
&gt; GOLDEN-WINGED SUNBIRD. MALACHITE SUNBIRD.
&gt; GOLDEN-BREASTED BUNTING. YELLOW-CROWNED CANARY.
&gt; ABYSSINIAN CRIMSONWING. RED-CHEEKED CORDON-BLEU. and
&gt;  GREY-HEADED SPARROW.
&gt; 
&gt; KWS have constructed an electric fence, which is
&gt; having an effect on the poaching, however 700 metres
&gt; have already been stolen, and we can guess what that
&gt; would be used for.
&gt; 
&gt; On the down side, in the two days we saw no recent
&gt; evidence of Elephant, no dung anywhere, there were a
&gt; few Red Duiker along the roads, and small numbers of
&gt; Buffalo, Waterbuck and Bushbuck. Black-and-White
&gt; Colobus were numerous with slightly less Blue
&gt; Monkeys.
&gt; 
&gt; Mt. Elgon is certainly well worth spending some time
&gt; investigating, and at present there is a phenomenon
&gt; taking place that occurs about once every fifty
&gt; years, the bamboo has seeded, and is now dying from
&gt; the  higher altitudes downwards.  Surprisingly the
&gt; abundant seeds that must be underneath are not
&gt; particularly attracting large numbers of any bird
&gt; species.
&gt; 
&gt; Something that may be worth looking into, the Yellow
&gt; White-eyes on Mt. Elgon have broad white eye-rings,
&gt; getting on for Montane in size, rather than the
&gt; narrow eye-ring of more typical Yellow.
&gt; 
&gt; I have included a very bad photo with a typical
&gt; Yellow, and the difference is quite obvious.
&gt; 
&gt; Best for now 
&gt; Brian
