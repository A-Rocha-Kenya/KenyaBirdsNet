&gt; Dear Itai
&gt; 
&gt; Could you possibly forward this question to the
&gt; group?.....
&gt; 
&gt; When we were in Lake Nakuru National Park we saw a
&gt; group of about five 
&gt; &#34;Helmet-shrikes&#34;. The first bird I examined was a
&gt; typical Grey-crested 
&gt; Helmet-shrike. It laked the yellow eye-wattle and
&gt; had the dark marks at the 
&gt; edge of the breast. The bird was no bigger than the
&gt; others. However we then 
&gt; discovered that the others were all typical
&gt; White-crested Helmet-shrikes 
&gt; instead.
&gt; 
&gt; Does any one have experience of the two species
&gt; forming mixed flocks?
&gt; 
&gt; Regards
&gt; 
&gt; Keith Betton

now, since Keith as already raised the issue, i would
like to support his question with another observation
from late Dec&#39; by Brian Finch and myself, again at L.
Nakuru (House of the Cormorants) where we had a mix
flock of the two species.

since P.p.poliocephalus is not suppose to be in Nakuru
this is a very very strange case (as this is the only
subspecies of White-crested Helmet Shrike that looks
similar to Grey-crested). P.p.cristatus which is known
from L. Nakuru has a completely different wing pattern
and also the yellow eye wattle. so what is going on
with L. Nakuru Helmet Shrikes? does anyone have any
idea?

i know that Mr. Neil Baker is also interested in
collecting more data on Grey-crested Helmet Shrikes
and therefore any observation of this kind (mixed
flocks, new sites...) will be most welcome to him.
