  <pre>Dear all

today at Nakuru NP with Bill Clark; 
2 Greater Spotted Eagles
1 Lesser Spotted Eagle
and many many Steppe Eagles.

the most interesting record was on our way to the park. just after 
Delamare estste (between Naivasha and Gilgil) an adult Grasshopper 
Buzzard!!! was standing 10 meter from the road on a small post. i 
know of old records of the species so far west, but not of any recent 
ones. can this be connected to the big rains that we had this January 
allover the country?!

all the best,
Itai
