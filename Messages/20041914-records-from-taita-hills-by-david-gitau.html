  <pre>hello itai,
some birding news from the taitas: 
during my ringing session in mbololo, i had the luck to catch two
Sharpe&#39;s Starlings, an immature and an adult. later on, a flock of 
around 10 was seen on the syzigium trees feeding. 

apart from that i  also managed to trap two African Gashawks and 
observed two Great Sparrowhawk mobing a Crowned Eagle which to me 
was quite intresting. two Yellow-bellied Greenbuls were also trapped 
and ringed in the forest (which is strange since they are usually
found in the lower regions where there its less forested).
another exciting sighting was of a Stripped Pipit within the forest, 
it was feeding on the ground alongside my netting lines! this is 
usually a species of the rocky areas and not of the forest. 

i will keep you updated on any other interesting records,

good birding.
Gitau.
