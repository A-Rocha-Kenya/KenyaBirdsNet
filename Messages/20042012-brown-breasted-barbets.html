Dear All,

I was very surprised and pleased to see two Brown Breasted Barbets just outside the 
Mombasa Club last Tuesday the 9th November. They were feeding on the small seeds of 
one of the palm trees growing in the garden beside the entrance into the Club reception. 
The seeds they were eating were dark in colour, obviously the ripe ones as most of the ones 
on the spray were still green.
The palm weavers do well there and nest in the palm trees in front of the Club, but it was 
good to see the barbets there.

Regards to all,

Maia Hemphill
