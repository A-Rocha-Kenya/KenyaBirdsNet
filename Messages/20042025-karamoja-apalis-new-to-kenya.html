  <hr/>
  <pre>Dear all,

Sometime during the last 3 weeks at the Massai Mara
GR, one Karamoja Apalis was called out using a tape
recording by Phil Showh (I hope that this is the
correct spelling), who had study the species on the
Wembere Plains in Tz and is one of the big fundis
of the species.

This is the 1st record of the species in Kenya and it
matches a pattern that is followed in Tanzania, of the
birds move towards protected areas due to habitat
loss. This bird is usually found in &#39;Whistling Thorn&#39;
Acacia and is suppose to be very active on the
canopies and to have a very distinct call. 

I will send more details as soon as I get them.
All the best, 
Itai
