VOLUNTEER FIELD ASSISTANT needed from 15 Jul ? 15 Sep 2004 approx. for a
study on the role of rainforest refugia and environmental gradients in
driving divergence in bird song. Study sites will be several national
parks in Uganda. Key study species are the Little Greenbul (Andropadus
virens), Green Hylia (Hylia prasina) and Yellow-rumped (Pogoniulus
bilineatus) and Yellow-throated Tinkerbirds (Pogoniulus subsulfureus)    
Work will be conducted in pristine rainforest and habitat mosaics in
Uganda. The aim of the project is to obtain recordings of the study
species from National Parks such as Queen Elizabeth, Bwindi Impenetrable,
Semliki, Murchison Falls and Kibale, as well as Semliki Wildlife Reserve
and Budongo Forest Reserve. Playback experiments will also be carried out.
Observations of bird behavior, habitat type, and relevant ecological
factors will need to be taken. Applicants should have field experience
working with birds and be prepared for the conditions in a tropical
rainforest, and maintain a positive and energetic attitude. We will be
working long hours, starting at dawn, and conditions could be hot and
humid. Biting insects are likely to be abundant in places, and necessary
precautions will need to be taken against malaria and other tropical
diseases. Some sites will involve camping in the forest with few basic
facilities. Applicants must be able to hike for distances of several miles
on some days. Times and schedules may vary, so flexibility is important.
Equipment to be used includes recorders and microphones, a playback device
with speaker, GPS, laptop computer for data analysis and of course
binoculars. Food and accommodation will be provided, but assistant will
need to provide airfare to and from Entebbe, Uganda. This could be a great
adventure for the right candidate, providing the opportunity to observe
some of the extraordinary wildlife in Uganda, as well as getting some
excellent field experience.  Please send cover letter, resume and list of
3 references to ALEX KIRSCHEL (EM: akirschel@yahoo.com), Department of
Organismic Biology, Ecology and Evolution, UCLA, for further details.
Fieldwork is due to begin approx. 15 Jul 2004, so a decision must be made
by 30 Jun 2004.
