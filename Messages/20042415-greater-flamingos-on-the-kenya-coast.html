  <pre>yep, plural

Jane is still in the Formosa Bay / Rasini area

and now Paola has joined her (more or less) from Lake Manyara where she has been for the last few months.

the latest fixes for these two birds.

Paola at 3.031 South and 40.152 East
Jane at 2.890 South and 40.160 East

We would love to know how many flamingos are in this general area. It&#39;s surely more than two !!

all the best
