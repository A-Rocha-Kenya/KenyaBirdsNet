  <pre>Dear Birders,
 
I am sorry for these informations,I was in a rather remote areas with 
no email at all .However I have some records worth notifying;
on the 17th Jan at 0900 hrs,leading a bird tour,we had two Buff-
spotted Flufftail, male and female and a digital photo was
taken for confirmation at Mt. lodge.
 
On the sad note; two Mackinders Eagle Owl on Nyahururu rd were hit by 
a car and lets hope the young Owl will survive because there was an 
adult ready to adopt the orphan.
 
On the 18th,Jan, Qljoro dondori rd near a school called uhuru  
primary we had three lesser jacanas.

On the 20thjan, in lake Nakuru we picked up Greater Sand Plover which 
I thought was unusual. On the way to Baringo we stopped at mogotio 
and there was one Common Redshank.   
  
Good birding.
Mel
