  <pre>Dear all,

I just returned from 3.5 days of birding with Mr. Bill Clark around 
Lokichokio area.
All together we had 139 species including some local specialities 
like Heuglin&#39;s Wheatear, Four-banded Sandgrouse, Abyssinian Ground 
Hornbills, Abyssinian Rollers and many many more. We had 22 species 
that were not recorded in the area in the last 2 expeditions made in 
the area (2001 and 2003, Finch et al.) and out of these 22 species, 
14 are not known at all from the area according to Zimmerman et al.

3 species were of great discovery; 
One Short-toed Snake Eagle 5 Km SE of Nanam village on the 29th Jan&#39; 
(photos were taken). 
A pair of Barbary Falcons that looked very local (almost as if 
keeping a territory) at a drinking point 19 Km out of town on the 
Lodwar Rd. (28th). 
And possibly, if confirmed, the 1st pair of Grey-headed Batis for 
Kenya, at a water hole (`Kalabash&#39;) 25 Km out of town on the Lodwar 
Rd on the 28th (photos were taken). 

Other than these, the following species are new to Lokichokio area;

* Little Grebe. One individual in winter plumage (maybe a migrant) in 
a water hole 25 Km out of town on the Lodwar Rd. 30th Jan&#39;.

* Green-backed Heron. Two individuals in a water hole 20 Km out of 
town on the Lodwar Rd. 28th Jan&#39;.

* Senegal Thick-knee. Two individuals in a water hole 20 Km out of 
town on the Lodwar Rd. 28th Jan&#39;. The birds were obviously keeping a 
territory and most probably had young individuals around.

* Black-winged Stilt. Five individuals in a water hole 27 Km out of 
town on the Lodwar Rd. 30th Jan&#39;.

* Feral Pigeon. Few birds in Lokichokio town.

* Malachite Kingfisher. One individual in a water hole 20 Km out of 
town on the Lodwar Rd. 28th Jan&#39;.

* Plain Martin. Few individuals flying above the Lotikip plains and 
also near the Oropoi junction 28th and 29th Jan&#39;.

* House Martin. Few individuals (roughly about 20 birds) flying above 
Oropoi 28th Jan&#39;.

* Common Rock Thrush. One Male 1 Km out of Lokichokio town, 30th Jan&#39;.

* Upcher&#39;s Warbler. One individual in a water hole 25 Km out of town 
on the Lodwar Rd. 28th Jan&#39;.

* Pied Crow. A pair out of Nananm village 29th Jan&#39;.

Species recorded that were not reported in the last 2 expeditions but 
are known from the literature; 
Pallid Harrier, Common Kestrel (we saw both the local and the migrant 
subspecies), Abyssinian Ground Hornbill, Rock Martin, Long-billed 
Pipit, Northern Wheatear, Pied Wheatear, Pale Flycatcher. 

In the last 4 years, 3 visits were made to Lokichokio area. In each 
visit few species were found as new to the area (and one even to the 
whole of EA). I am sure that there is still much to discover in the 
far NW of the country and I recommend to all who have some adventure 
blood running through their veins, go up and explore these unknown 
areas of Kenya.

Happy birding to all,
Itai
