  <pre>Dear Colin Simon and all.

wow, that is a great record indeed!!! thanks Simon.

just to add some more info regarding Sooty in our
&#39;neighborhood&#39;;

Sooty Shearwater is a regular species up at the tip of
the Red Sea; Eilat/ Aqaba bay (which is in a way one
tip of the Indian Ocean), during the months of
March-May and even some during the summer (i will have
to check for more details later for specific dates).
one can easily see from the beach up to 10 individuals
flying around together with other species.

it is also known as a rare vagrant at the western
shores of the Mediterranean Sea (mainly during winter
time).
but as Colin just wrote, this is an extreme record and
i believe that the closest ever might be around
Seychelles (but again this must be checked).

great stuff,
Itai  

p.s. i will upload the photo just now so you can all
find it under the Rarity file in the photos section
