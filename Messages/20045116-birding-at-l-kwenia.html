  <pre>Hello Birders,
             Well during the weekend of 13/14 March,a
group of people from Dept of Ornithology and
birdcommittee went for a birding tour with Munir
Virani to look at a Ruppell&#39;s Griffon Vulture colony
at L.Kwenia which is a seasonal lake which fills up
during heavy rains.L.Kwenia lies in the Kedong
Valley,south west of Nairobi in Kajiado District.
             Some good birds were seen like Eurasian
Cuckoo,Great Spotted Cuckoo,Eurasian
Hobby,White-tailed Lark and Egyptian Vulture.The
Eurasain Cuckoo was calling and in the birds of Kenya
and Northern Tanzania,it is writing that the cuckoo
does not call in East Africa.It was a suprise to all
of us.
              Bye,
                 Shailesh.
