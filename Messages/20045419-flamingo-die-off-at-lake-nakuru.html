  <pre>Dear all,

Does anyone have an update on the recent lesser flamingo die-off at Lake Nakuru?  Is the die-off continuing or has it died down, if you&#39;ll pardon the awful pun?  Have there been any new attempts to guestimate the total number that have died?  Have there been any attempts to determine the cause?

I would appreciate any info anyone has, as I would like to include something in today&#39;s update of the Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust website on our lesser flamingo satellite tracking project (www.wwt.org.uk/flamingo).  This has been a tense time for us, as several of the lesser flamingos we&#39;ve been tracking have been on Lake Nakuru recently, and the people who have helped pay for this research by adopting these birds are naturally concerned about the situation there.

Many thanks,

Brooks Childress
