  <pre>Greetings all

Nature Kenya birders and National Museums ornithologists have been busy with
the African Waterbird Census this month.  A few interesting records from the
surveys in which I took part:

African Open-billed Stork.  Group of ten on shores of Lake Naivasha, 24
January 04

African Spoonbill.  Five pairs nesting in tall Casuarina tree beside small
dam and swamp on private land in Karen-Langata area, Nairobi.  Carrying
nesting material, displaying and calling to each other and/or sitting on
nests.  21 January 04.

Also, Cuckoo Hawk, one, Upper Hill, Nairobi, 24 January 04
House Martin, flock over northern shore of Lake Elmenteita, 23 January 04.
Jackson&#39;s Widowbird, small flock on private land in Karen-Langata area, 21
January 04

Last but not least, a partially albino pipit!  Seen by several bird counters
in grassland on shore of Lake Naivasha at the KWSTI &#34;Annex&#34; next to KWS
Hippo Camp, 23 and 24 January 04.  General appearance of a Grassland Pipit,
but head, shoulders and top of chest all white with a few scattered streaks.
Beak yellow.  Foraged in the grassland all around the end of the road at the
old fisheries jetty.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
