  <pre>Last week 26th, Albert of Spinetail Safaris was in the forest with a guest and along the 
main track in from Mida saw TWO PAIRS of Spotted Ground Thrush showing very 
clearly on the track about 400m apart - so well in fact that the mgeni was able to get 
cracking photos of them!  These are the first records of this Globally Endangered 
species in ASF for the year and also the first along this section of the forest since 
before 1998. David Ngala used to see them regularly along here and I remember him 
saying it was a good place to look when I first was down here - but none have been 
seen since I was around until these ones. IT is also very interesting that they were in 
pairs on the road - again, something which is not commonly reported (if anyone 
reading this HAS seen them in pairs on non-breeding grounds, do let me know).

Albert also saw four Zebra Waxbills at Sabaki on the 24th and they were still present 
on the 26th. A thorough search for them over the weekend didn&#39;t turn them up, 
however, so it would appear they were just passing through briefly. There have been 9 
Red-billed Buffalo Weavers at Sabaki however, reported by Simon Valle who is 
assisting me with some fieldwork there currently. The Lesser Flamingos have all gone 
from there, but are still 90 or so Greaters. Also interestingly, there are no Mad Prats at 
Sabaki currently - Collared there are, but the Mad have all vanished - where to is 
anyone&#39;s guess. Wader numbers are very low as to be expected. 

On Tues 18th May, another (the same? tho&#39; no ring was observed...) Eastern Green 
Tinkerbird was seen in the Nature Trail area of Mwamba Bird Obs. and Field Study 
Centre. Maybe this species hangs around outside of the main forests more than we 
previously knew...
