  <pre>Dear all,

i went down today towards Shampole with some non
birders friends. 
down at the swamp at least 10 Madagascar Squacco
Herons were seen together with few (only 4 were
counted) Common Squacco&#39;s. also around few Glossy
Ibis&#39;s and one Imm&#39; Saddle-billed Stork (do they breed
there??) the bird had very fuzzy look and coloures
were very dull. one breeding pair of Coloured
Pratincle were found near the bridge over the Ewaso
Nyiro. 

coming back towards the hot springs many Flamingos,
Pelicans were seen but the most interesting were a
pair of Pied Avocets with 3 chicks and also about 40
Curlew Sandpipers in full breeding plumage.

happy birding to all,
Itai
