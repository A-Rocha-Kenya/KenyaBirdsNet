  <pre>Dear all,

The Second Darwin workshop will be run for 6 days from Sunday April 
11th to Saturday April 17th 2004 inclusive, at Lake Bogoria National 
Reserve Park HQ, Loboi, for 20 persons.

The topics will be the taxonomy of PLANTS, INVERTEBRATES, and BIRDS; 
each given two days of classroom and field research. This workshop 
is designed for people who work in conservation either as 
professionals of volunteers, but who do not have a background 
training in taxonomy (e.g. such as received in a degree or diploma 
course).

The course will be organised by Dr David Harper, Leicester and 
Professor Ken Mavuti, University of Nairobi. The tutors will be Mr 
Geoffrey Mwachala (Herbarium, National Museums of Kenya); Mr Tony 
Drane (Earthwatch scientist, UK) and Mr Laban Njoroge (Entomology 
Department, National Museums of Kenya), Mr Alfred Owino (Ornithology 
Department, National Museums of Kenya) and Professor John Cooper 
(University of the West Indies). 

All accommodation and food will be provided for all participants in 
a tented camp at Loboi (participants should bring 2 sheets), and 
take place in the National Reserve Education Centre. Participants 
will be reimbursed their travel expenses (at public bus transport 
rates) and given a small per diem allowance to cover costs of sodas 
etc.
