  <pre>Hello Birders,
             This month is waterfowls counts.On
18thJan,we went for a count at Thika Sewage
Ponds.Along the road towards the sewage is a swamp
where we saw Yellow-crowned Bishops,Common Kestrel.At
the sewage ponds,we saw Spotted Redshank,large flocks
of Garganeys,few Northern Pintails,a good number of
Black-crowned Night Heron about 15 and a pair of
Common Teal.A Male Common Teal was seen by Fleur&#39;s
group.A Female Common Teal was seen by Bernard Chege
and Myself.The female looks similar to a female
Garganey,but duller in colour and smaller in size.
            Bye,
                Shailesh.
