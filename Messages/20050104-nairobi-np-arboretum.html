Happy new year to all,,,
I sent this mail but bounced back. It�s now an old one
but still worth a report

Dear all
On Monday 20th December Colin, Graham and I visited
Nairobi National Park and had a good number of bird.
No big number of migrants but at least there were 
Red-throated Pipits, 
Eurasian Marsh Harrier, 
Eurasian Bee-eater, 
Pied Wheater, 
Isabelline Wheatear
Willow Warbler, 
Also Jackson�s Widowbird in breeding plumage.

However, the story for the day in the park was 4
Ostriches (1 male and 3 females) with over 50 young
ones.  I�ve never witness this before.

On 21nd Olorgesaile which is pretty dry but as usual
good number of birds.
Arboretum afternoon fetched another group of
Grey-Olive Greenbul. 

On the 22nd had an African Grey Parrot at the Nairobi
University. A single stressed individual squeaking and
calling all over. An escapee!!!!.  Probably the same
individual seen by Muoki Kioko flying above Westlands
about two weeks ago. 

Good luck and all the best during the x-mass



=====
With Kind Regards
