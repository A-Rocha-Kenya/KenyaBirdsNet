  <pre>Hello Birders,
                   Just want to know if a Olive Sunbird as never been seen in Nairobi by any birders.Accorded to the checklist of the birds of Nairobi by Bill Harvey doesn&#39;t  have a Olive Sunbird in the list.It is because the Nairobi Ringing Group ringed a Male Olive Sunbird on 10th of this month at Karara,Karen.We did take photos of the bird.
                             Shailesh.
