Dear all

I have just returned from a 3 week safari round Kenya and thought the
following might be of interest.

1.  Rukinga (Taita Discovery Centre) 20-23 Dec.

Tawny Pipit (3 0n Galla airstrip - carefully studied and white outer tail
feathers well seen);

2.  Taita Hills 21 Dec.

The Thrush, Apalis and White-eye.  Tape-recorded the Apalis.

5.  Kakamega Forest 01-05 Jan.

Bat Hawk;  Black-billed Turaco; Red-chested Owlet; Chapin&#39;s Flycatcher;
Orange-tufted Sunbird(1 male seen well); Oriole Finch(1 male).

6. Kitale Area 05-08 Jan.

Egyptian Vulture (2 on raod to Kongelai);  Red-chested Flufftail (Sirikwa);
Grey-rumped Swallow Saiwa); Tree Pipit(Kaprech Forest, Cherangani); Mountain
Illadopsis (Saiwa); Spotted Creeper(2 edge of Kaprech Forest); Bronze-tailed
Starling (Sirikwa); Slendid Starling (Sirikwa); Lesser Blue-eared Starling;
Black-crowned Waxbill (Kaprech).


According to Zimmerman et al. the voice of Pale-breasted Illadopsis has not
been adequately recorded in Kenya.  I did manage to get a good recording of
this species in Kakamega, in case anyone is interested. On the other hand, I
never managed to hear anything resembling the song of the Grey-chested
Illadopsis, let alone see it.  Any advice on how I might do better would be
welcome.

Best regards to you all

Nigel Hunter
