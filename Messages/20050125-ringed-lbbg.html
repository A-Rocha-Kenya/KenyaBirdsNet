&gt; this just in from Risto who was in Tanzania
&gt; counting Lake Victoria this month.
&gt; 
&gt; Hi Neil and James 
&gt; 
&gt; It is a Finnish one, but not mine ;-(    (I have made
&gt; the ring however).  
&gt; Please send all the read data (excat place, coord&#39; also if 
&gt; possible) to Finnish Ringing Centre elmu_ren@cc.helsinki.fi
&gt; 
&gt; ps. I saw 4 different read ringed LBBGs in Victoria.
&gt; I could not read the codes by 
&gt; telescope, but it is possible that one of them is
&gt; readable from videodigiscoped tape. 
&gt; We saw totally near 300 LBBGs and checked nearly 200
&gt; legs (pairs).
&gt; It was a nice count, but quite expensive count. In
&gt; my group we had to pay 560 000 
&gt; Tsh for fuel, boat and boatman allowance!
