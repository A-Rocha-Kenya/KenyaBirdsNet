Hello there, 
Thanks to all the people who have replied to my gull question.  I was put in touch with the Finnish Ringing Centre who have been able to tell me that the gull was ringed in July 2001 as a nestling in western Finland.  More details may be forthcoming but I have to wait for snail mail from Finland to find out.  I will post this information as soon as it arrives.  Thanks again,

James
