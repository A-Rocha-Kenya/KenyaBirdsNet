  <pre>Dear all,

after a very long period out of the country, i went
down the Magadi Rd. today with Tal.

the heavy rains that went down last night must have
been trough out as all the rivers are flowing and it
is very very wet all over.
the vegetation is still dry though, so it must have
been the first rains of recent.

bird wise it seems that very soon it will be very
colourful, as all species are changing to their
breeding plumage and some are already in their full
breeding.

down at the bridge, we had a nice view of the &#39;Magadi
Puffback&#39; (Pringel&#39;s Puffback), it is always nice to
see how different this population is from the nominate
one in Eastern Kenya.

other than this species it was all regular (migrants
are not very many, but still well represented).

all the best and happy birding,
Itai
