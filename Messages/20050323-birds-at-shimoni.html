Dear All,

Two interesting sightings last week. A Shikra on our birdbath!!! on 
the 13th March, and the following day a Tambourine Dove on the 
birdbath in company with two Emererald Spotted Wooddoves. We 
hear the Tambourine Dove now and again, but don&#39;t often see it, so 
it was great to have him on the bath. The Shikra was even more 
special, and it spent some time there enjoying a drink and a wash, 
before eventually flying off. I have seen them occasionally down 
here but not for a long time.
Our birdbath is right in front of our sitting room windows so we get 
a good view.
