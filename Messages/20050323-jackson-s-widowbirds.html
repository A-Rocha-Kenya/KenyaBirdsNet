Greetings

Small flocks of Jackson&#39;s Widowbirds in breeding plumage were recorded by
Nature Kenya&#39;s Wednesday morning birdwalk at the University of Nairobi
demonstration plot in Loresho on March 2, and on the hillside with seasonal
pools near the Carnivore Restaurant on March 23.

On March 23 we also saw a group of ten Grey Crowned Cranes drinking
rainwater in rock pools, and heard Barn Swallows twittering as they flew.

Good birding, Fleur
