  <pre>Greetings birders

In this Southern Hemisphere springtime, Nature Kenya&#39;s Wednesday  
Morning Birdwalks are recording many birds. Some highlights:

October 26, City Park: Wahlberg&#39;s Honeybird, with a brown back, and  
displaying the white patches on the sides of the lower back, shown in  
the books but rarely seen in the field.

November 2, Paradise Lost, Kiambu:
Booted Eagle, white phase
Eurasian Bee-eaters
Barn Swallows
Willow Warbler
Garden Warbler
Spotted Flycatcher
and
Grey-olive Greenbul by the stream below the waterfall
plus
Battersby&#39;s Green-Snake
and a large brown snake with some red and black patches near the head

Thanks to Paradise Lost management and all for a delightful morning.

Fleur
