Dear All,

I went into Nairobi National Park on 10th April, thinking that there 
would be a good selection as well as high numbers of migrants in 
view of the recent rains.... But I was wrong.

The migrants recorded consisted of..... Montagu&#39;s Harrier (3), 
Eurasian Marsh Harrier (1), Common Buzzard (3), Lesser Kestrel (40), 
Northern Hobby (1), Little Stint (2), Common Greenshank (3), Green 
Sandpiper (1), Wood Sandpiper (15), Common Sandpiper (2), Eurasian 
Swift (10), Eurasian Bee-eater (7), Eurasian Roller (1), Yellow 
Wagtail (1), Tree Pipit (1), Sand Martin (1), House Martin (8), Barn 
Swallow (over 5000), Whinchat (1), Spotted Flycatcher (4), Garden 
Warbler (8), Willow Warbler (3 [only!]), Red-backed Shrike (30), Red-
tailed Shrike (4), Lesser Grey Shrike (20) and Eurasian Golden 
Oriole (4).  Where on earth are all the warblers this year?

Other erratically recorded species were.... Saddle-billed Stork 
(pair Hyena Dam run-off Swamp), Fan-tailed Warbler (bottom of road 
from Impala Lookout), Violet-backed Starling (10 edge of Kisembe 
Forest), Chestnut Sparrow (10 Hippo Pools mainly males in breeding 
plumage), Jackson&#39;s Widowbird (over 300 coming to roost in Hyena Dam 
run-off Swamp).

On 6th April I was on Red Hill Road and at the Gacharage end near 
the junction with the main Naivasha Road there is a quarry on the 
roadside, that had Horus Swifts prospecting. This could be an 
interesting breeding record for the immediate Nairobi area.

All the best from Brian W. Finch
