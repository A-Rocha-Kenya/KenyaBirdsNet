  <pre>Mombasa Bird Walk Sat 16th April Huseini Dairy Car Track, Nguu Tatu

One last ditch effort to see a Wheatear before the last of migrants departed was my aim, not having seen a single one all season. Unfortunately there was not a one to be seen. However the proliferation of Lesser Grey and Red Backed Shrikes as well as hundreds of Barn Swallows almost made up for the diappointment. We also saw a lone Eurasian Golden Auriole and one Olivaceous Warbler.  Other birds of interest were a male African Paradise Flycatcher with a half brown and half white tail.  Rest of plumage as in brown phase. A Whalberg&#39;s Eagle and a Black Shouldered Kite were resting in the Doum Palms. Fairly rare in this area these days! The pond, although fairly full of water yielded only one African Darter. His circling flight down from the sky and then his snake-like head swimming through the water delighted us all. Weavers starting to nest. Pin-Tail Whydahs displaying so let&#39;s hope for rain! 

This area has large groups of Starlings Blue Earred and Superb and as far as I know is the only place around Mombasa where they can be seen. As long as one does one&#39;s birding when the cars are not racing round, this is a very good area and nearly always yields some special species as well as having many common locals. 

Karibu Mombasa Bird Walk every 3rd Sat in the month. Meet Ratna Square 4 p.m. Marlene Reid
