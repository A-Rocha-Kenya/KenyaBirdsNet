  <pre>Greetings

Nairobi National Park in early May, after a couple of heavy rains, is rich
in birds, including  northern and southern migrants.  This morning, May 2,
near Leopard Cliffs, there was a tree filled with Barn Swallows, and next to
it a tree filled with Madagascar Bee-eaters!  Seasonal records from a
morning&#39;s outing with Chris Hill and Dino Martins:

Lesser Kestrel  about 40
Kori Bustard  1
Lesser Moorhen  2 (where the main road to Hippo Pools makes a sharp bend
over a bridge)
Wood Sandpiper  8
Madagascar Bee-eater  about 20
Barn Swallows  flocks
Yellow Wagtail  2
Rosy-breasted Longclaw  4
Red-backed Shrike 1

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
