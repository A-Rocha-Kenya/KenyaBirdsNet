  <pre>Greetings

On 25 May Nature Kenya&#39;s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk visited the  
Windsor Golf and Country Club. The small island on the dam was  
particularly rewarding, with African Black Duck, African Darter,  
Great and Long-tailed Cormorants, and nesting colonies of Speke&#39;s  
Weavers and African Golden Weavers.

According to Bill Harvey&#39;s Annotated Checklist of the Birds of  
Nairobi, African Golden Weavers had also nested there in October 91  
and December 95. These appear to be the only records for Nairobi.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
