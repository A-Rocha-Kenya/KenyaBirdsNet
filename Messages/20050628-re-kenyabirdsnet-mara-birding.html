  <pre>I would be very interested if you can find and locate the following species:

1) Crowned Eagles;
2) African Hawk Eagles:
3) Ayre&#39;s Eagles.

During our eight surveys through the Mara, we have not seen the above birds.

Also, we are monitoring nests of White-headed Vultures and so any 
information on new nests that you may come across would be highly 
appreciated.

cheers,
