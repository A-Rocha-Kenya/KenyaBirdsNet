  <pre>Hi all, 

Just to make you aware of the following ongoing
discussion on Recent taxonomic changes to African
Threatened birds (see below). This can be found in the
Globally Threatened Birds Forum in the BirdLife
International website at: 
http://208.185.149.227/WebX?50@187.PYCxaWhabbd.1@.2cba4fb7

You can make a contribution by directly replying

&#34;Kulal White-eye Zosterops kulalensis (currently
Vulnerable), South Pare White-eye Z. winifredae
(currently Vulnerable) and Taita White-eye Z. silvanus
(currently Endangered). These three taxa were split
from Montane White-eye Z. poliogastrus by Collar et
al. (1994) but the minor plumage differences are not
now considered sufficient to warrant this treatment.
All three will be now be treated as subspecies of
Montane White-eye, and will be listed as Not
Recognised in the 2006 IUCN Red List.&#34;
