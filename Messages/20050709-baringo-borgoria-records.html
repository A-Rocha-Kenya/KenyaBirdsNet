  <pre>Hi all:

Just returned from Lake Baringo after doing a Fish Eagle count.
Here are some records of interest:

At Borgoria

Grey Kestrel near Marigat
Pygmy falcon
one Avocet near Hot springs


At Baringo

Hundreds (if not more) of Barn Swallows near the southern shores of Baringo;
Breeding Grosbeak weavers
lots of Whiskered terns
one spur-winged goose
Madagascar Bee eaters.
Only ONE Dark Chanting Goshawk.

I would be interested to hear from birders where they have seen good 
populations of Dark Chanting Goshawks.

cheers,

Munir
