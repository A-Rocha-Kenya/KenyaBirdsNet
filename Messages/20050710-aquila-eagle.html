  <pre>Dear all,

a friend of my has been to Kenya last month. He shot a great series of
photographs, but their are still a few U.F.O.&#39;s on some. One of those is a
Aquila eagle, seen in Lake Nakuru NP, 24th of June this year. I couldn&#39;t
help him identify the species. We doub about two species, namelijk the
Lesser Spotted and the Tawny. Is their anybody here who can help me identify
this raptor. Great thanks in advance.

Hope to hear from someone.

Cheers,

Rick van der Weijde
