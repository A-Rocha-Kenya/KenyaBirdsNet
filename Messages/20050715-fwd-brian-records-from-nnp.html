  <pre>&gt; Dear All
&gt; I went into Nairobi Park today (12th December), a
&gt; Common Teal
&gt; (Green-winged now refers to carolinensis, following
&gt; their separation
&gt; again) on Athi Dam was a new species for the Park.
&gt; The Avocet has found
&gt; a friend, but the Spur-winged Plover appears to have
&gt; lost his. Otherwise
&gt; very little of note, very poor for migrants and best
&gt; Afrotropical
&gt; species was a WahlbergÂ’s Honeybird near the Ivory
&gt; Burning Site.
&gt;  
&gt; Very best for now
&gt;  
&gt; Brian


I rather go birding...
