  <pre>Greetings birders

Six noisy Hinde&#39;s Babblers at the Tana River bridge were the  
highlight of a most enjoyable Saturday outing organized by Catherine  
Ngarachu of Nature Kenya. Workmen were cutting the lantana bushes  
favoured by the Hinde&#39;s Babblers between the main road and the access  
road to the Tana power station, but suitable bushy habitat remained  
on the hillside.

Later, next to Savage Wilderness white-water rafting site, we heard  
some kind of babblers calling from scrub and lantana bushes, but were  
unable to see them.

Other nice birds at the Tana River bridge included four kingfishers –  
Giant, Pied, Pygmy and Grey-headed – Rufous Chatterers and an  
immature African Moustached Warbler.

Wishing you good birding,

Fleur
