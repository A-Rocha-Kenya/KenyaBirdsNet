  <pre>Hi all,
 
A glossy starling, photographed in Masai Mara NP by dutch birder Lesley van Loo, caused some debate, wether it is Lesser or Greater Blue-eared Starling or even Sharp-tailed Glossy Starling. Greater is due to it&#39;s distribution the most reliable option, but we couldn&#39;t eclude Lesser for the full 100%. Especcially the colour of the eye is strange for Greater Blue-eared Starling (as it&#39;s orange in stead of yellow) So if anyone of you want to help us with the identification, we would really like to here it. You can reply to my personal email or the emailgroups.
Pictures of the bird can be found here:

I hope someone of you can help us!
 
greats and fine birding
