  <pre>The birds are still great in cold, grey, overcast Nairobi.

Madagascar Squacco Heron, 1 immature, seen on August 3 on the  
hillside with seasonal pools near Uhuru Gardens and the Carnivore  
Restaurant by the Wednesday Morning Birdwalk.

Martial Eagle, a pair with a young in the nest, on 7 August in the  
Sosian River Valley in Nairobi National Park, seen and heard calling  
by Fleur Ng&#39;weno, Daleep Heyer et al.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
