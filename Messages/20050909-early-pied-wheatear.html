  <pre>Dear all,

Yesterday, together with Tal, we drove down the Magadi
Rd. and crossed from Ol-tepesi to Suswa, what a great
road for scenery and birds...
There were lots of birds all over and many were
changing into breeding plumage. 
The only un-usual record for the day was a very early
Pied Wheatear up at Corner Baridi. This is a species
I usually see not before mid October or the earliest,
beginning of October. I just wonder if anyone else
have records of early migrants (please send them if
you do).

Happy birding to all and enjoy the coming migration
season,
Itai
