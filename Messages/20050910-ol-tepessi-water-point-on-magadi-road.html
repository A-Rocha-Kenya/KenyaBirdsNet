  <pre>Greetings birders

Nature Kenya&#39;s Sunday Birdwatch visited Olorgesailie Prehistoric Site  
and Ol Tepessi Water Point in August, as you may have read in John  
Fox&#39;s column in the Sunday Nation. We had excellent views of Bare- 
eyed Thrush and Somali Golden-breasted Bunting.

At the Water Point, we explained our presence when we arrived (we  
were quite a large group), and all seemed well. However, as we  
returned from a walk along the dry river bed, we were met by more of  
the community leaders. They objected to our visit without prior  
arrangement, and thought we might be taking photos. Well, we  
explained that we were only looking at birds through binoculars, and  
apologized for not informing the right people, and all was well again.

However, bird-watching groups were requested to follow this procedure  
in future:

1. On arrival at the water point, notify the person in charge of the  
water pump

2. Be prepared to &#34;bring a token&#34; to thank the Ol Tepessi community  
&#34;for looking after the birds&#34;

This is therefore to inform other birders that you may be requested  
to give a small parking donation at Ol Tepessi Water Point. It seems  
fair to me (we are using the road and facilities meant to benefit the  
community) as long as the fee is reasonable and goes to the community.

As I write this, another idea occurs: It would be so great to have  
pictures of the most visible birds for visitors to the Prehistoric  
Site and the Ol Tepessi community!

We could make a list of the 20 commonest birds; get digital photos of  
each bird; and print the photos, with their names, on a sheet of  
paper on a colour printer. Then donate a copy to each site.

Any volunteers?

With best wishes from Fleur
