  <pre>Greetings birders

Last Sunday afternoon, 11 September 2005, we took a visitor to  
Nairobi National Park for a couple of hours. Wood and Common  
Sandpipers seemed to have just arrived at Hyena Dam, and some Barn  
Swallows flew over the grasslands. Two female or immature bustards  
with finely vermiculated feathers were taking a dust bath on the  
track nearby.

Well, we also looked at mammals, since we had a visitor: a pride of  
ten lions, hundreds of zebras, a herd of wildebeest crossing the  
track, giraffes, baboons, and a variety of antelopes. Did someone say  
that there was nothing to see in Nairobi National Park?

With good wishes from Fleur
