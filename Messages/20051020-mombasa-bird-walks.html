  <pre>Dear Birders,

Here I am back from the coasts of Northern Ireland and the wilds of Wales and Yorkshire.

Bird walk for Sept. in Nguu Tatu was decidely dry but there was water in the big pond. Nothing really startling around except for the fact that the pond now has 2 African Darters.  Unfortunately second one was seen at dusk on opposite side of lake. It was paler but couldn&#39;t see if it was a female. Would be good to have some breeding!  Trouble is that there is so much human activity at the pond, probably because all the others are dry.  Good thing is it does have fish!  Other birds of note: Large flock of Namaqua Doves and thousands of Red Billed Quelea. One Black Shouldered Kite.

Oct bird walk was in Kikambala, at a farm where unfortunately lots of the scrub had been cut to grow crops so many of the species missing.  Such unreasonable people these farmers! White Throated and one carmine Bee-Eater seen on distant tree. Birds of note: Brown Breasted Barbets, Yellow Bellied Greenbul, Black Bellied Starlings, Great Sparrowhawk, LittleSparrowhawk flying by. Yellowbill calling.  Good to be back birding in Africa! Marlene Reid - Mombasa.
