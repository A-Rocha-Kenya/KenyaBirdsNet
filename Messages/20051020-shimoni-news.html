  <pre>Hi everyone,

Simon reported an Immature Greater Frigate on Tuesday 18th 2005 off 
the south west cost of Pemba Island. He was on his way from Nungwi 
in Zanzibar to Moani in Pemba and was 13 miles from Makupa at the 
time. It was definitely a Frigate, brown in colour with a white patch on 
chest and a white head. I checked Birds of Africa Vol 1 Seabirds and 
certainly an immature Greater Frigate.

The other thing of interest down here has been the Carmine Beeeaters. 
Usually they arrive down here (Ramisis/Shimoni area) in 
October/November and leave  when the monsoon changes and the 
long rains start. This last year some stayed all year and were here all 
through the long rains right up into October, they have now been joined 
by many more, but we did have quite a lot all through the year!!

One Ringed Plover seen on the 15th October.
