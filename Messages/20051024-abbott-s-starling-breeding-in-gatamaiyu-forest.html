Greetings hoping this finds you well.

On 22nd Oct Shailesh, JH and I visited Gatamaiyu
Forest. It was just but another great birding day
watching a male Abbott&#39;s Starling carrying food,
enters in to a nest to feed. then some min later the
juv pops out half the body to watch us. 

Though the male seemed abit disturbed by us spending
10 min watching us before going in to the nest, the
young one(s) are almost to fledge. 
The Bird Atlas of Kenya says there is now confirmed
breeding record in kenya. Does anyone knows of any
confirmed one?

While a month ago on the same tree, same branch i was
watching 3 Sharpes Starling singing on a misty
morning.

Another good breeding records was a pair of
White-backed Duck with three youngones at Manguo
Ponds. Migrants includes the Northern Shoveller,
Eurasian Marsh Harrier, Southern Pochard.

wish you a great spotting

With Kind Regards
chege kariuki
