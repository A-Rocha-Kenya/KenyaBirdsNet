The highlight species were per site:-
 
1.L.Naivasha
Common House Martin - 2.

Eurasian Roller - 1.
 
2.Gatamaiyu Forest.
Abbott&#39;s Starling - 1[Juv].
White-browed Crombec - 2.
White-tailed Crested Flycatcher - 1.
 
3.Kinangop Plateaux.
Sharpe&#39;s Longclaw - 1.
 
Tha Abbott&#39;s Starling [Juv] which i saw was the one the adult male was feeding on 22th.
 
                              Happy Birding,
                                 Shailesh
