  <pre>Dear all
On the 1st of June Chris Hill, Karen Plumbe, Heather,
I et al, went down the Magadi Road still very green
with long grass in some flat terrain. 

Birds to note included the Pringles Puffback, Horus
Swift near the bridge, Common Button Quail well heard
and a flush-off it. 

While farther down near the two water wholes were the
Chestnut Weavers nesting in big colony. This we seen
the last two weeks, males starting nest-building
during the Sunday Birdwalk on the 15th of May 05, most
of them (nests) were in ring stage.

However, on the 1st of June, the 17th day we saw
females feeding by bringing food (caterpillars) to the
young ones in the nest. This time only females doing
the feeding.
Then going some few hundred meters down we found
another new colony coming up and the tree was full of
males building the nest together with the Spekes
Weaver while the Chestnut Sparrows busy wing quivering
and trying to take over the nest from the Chestnut
Weavers.
