  <hr/>
  <pre>Dear all,

This year raptor migration survey over Israel has finished recently 
(this survey is being done annually between Aug&#39; and Oct&#39;, for the 
last 20 years, and it counts all the raptors moving over Israel at 
that time). 

this year totals are quite high;

Honey Buzzards - 415,000.
Levant Sparrowhawk - 65,000.
Lesser Spotted Eagle - 94,000 (53,000 in one single day at the 
beginning of Oct&#39;. this is the highest bird count on a single day 
ever).

also there are several hundreds Eurasian Sparrowhawks, Short-toed 
Snake Eagles, Red-footed Falcons, Steppe Eagles, Steppe Buzzards...

in this survey the volunteers counts also the White Storks, and this 
year count is standing on 330,000.
Black Storks and White Pelicans and Common Crane are staying in 
Israel for the winter and thus it is harder to count them when they 
move around. 

all the best,
Itai
