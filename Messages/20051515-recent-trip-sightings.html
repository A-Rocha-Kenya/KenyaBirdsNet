Hello All,

Like Nigel Hunter, have just completed a three week trip in Kenya, 
interestingly in many of the same places.  The following notes are of 
interest.

Lake Baringo Club (20th-23rd Dec)- 7 African Skimmers, Heuglins 
Courser, 3 Black Heron, 1 Western Reef Heron, 1 Fox Kestrel (cliffs), 
2 Lead-coloured Flycatcher (close to Marigat on Kabarnet Road).

Kericho area (23rd-26th Dec) - 1 White-crested Turaco and 2 Oriole 
Finch (along river below tea hotel - very odd locations - especially 
for the turaco), Yellow-spotted Barbet, Equatorial Akalat, Black-
faced Rufous Warbler, Sharpes and Stuhlmann&#39;s Starling (all below tea 
hotel), 2 Shelley&#39;s Greenbull, Mountain Illadopsis (SW Mau Forest) - 
we managed to find a new road (very recently graded) that cut through 
virgin forest at the SW Mau - approximately 4-5kms past Chebangbang 
Village - followed it for several kms - good forest birding 
opportunities but probably bad news for the forest, Great Snipe 
(Awasi)

Kakamega Forest (27th Dec), Oriole Finch, Southern Hyliota, African 
Broadbill (Ikuywa River), Semi-collared Flycatcher (Rondo)

28th Dec, Rock Pratincole (Mumias), Compact Weaver (Alupe)

Sirikwa Safaris (28th-30th Dec) - Marsh Widowbird (Keringet Dam), 
Gambaga Flycatcher, Slender-billed Starling (Kongolai), Splendid 
Starling, Bronze-tailed Starling, Red-chested Flufftail (Sirikwa 
area - apparently Spotted Creeper no longer present in immediate area 
of the camp - last sighting ~3yrs ago?), Heuglin&#39;s Masked Weaver 
(Keiyo Village) - unfortunately Kanyarkwat off limits at this time!

Cheers,

James Bradley
