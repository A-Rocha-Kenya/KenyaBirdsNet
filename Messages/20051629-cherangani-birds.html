  <pre>Hi all,

Just returned with Simon Thomsett from the Cherangani Hills over the last four days.
The area is being devastated by illegal logging and deforestation. I have pictures of Mt Elgon teak being cut down and sawed into planks right on the side of the road. October is certainly the best time to visit with the fields on the moorlands just covered in a spectacular array of purple and yellow flowers. Proteas just about to flower and Lobelias as awesome as ever. A little tiny hut called the Chelimo Hotel on the ridge serves the most amazing tea and egg-chapatis (ask for chef Jacob!!).

Overall an excellent trip with the following highlights:
- a pair of Lammergeiers soaring and displaying;
- at least 50 Steppe Buzzards;
- Peregrine on a nest;
- a trio of Wahlberg&#39;s Eagles displaying near Moi&#39;s Bridge (suspect possible polyandry??)
- Malachite sunbird ;
- 100&#39;s of Fan-tailed Ravens by the cliffs (interspersed with a few White-necked Ravens).

The Cherangani Hills is one of the &#34;five water towers&#34; of this country (along with Mau, Aberdares, Mt Kenya and Mt Elgon). It is truly shocking to see that very little forest remains. Slopes have started to erode with landslides a common occurrence. 

Happy Birding,


Munir Virani
