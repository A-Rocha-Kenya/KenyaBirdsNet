Hi Folks,

Wonder if anyone could help me.  I saw a ringed Lesser Black-backed Gull 
(3rd winter - fuscus?) at Lake Naivasha on 31st Dec 04 and was able to read 
a combination through the scope:

right (aluminium - unreadable), left (white colour band - C8YA)

Is anyone able to provide any information on this bird or advise me on who 
to contact with the details?

Many Thanks,

James Bradley
