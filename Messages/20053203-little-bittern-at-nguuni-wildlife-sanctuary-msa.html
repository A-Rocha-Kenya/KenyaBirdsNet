  <pre>Halo all,

On Tuesday, 26th July, in one of the ponds-to-be at a
Rehabilitation site of the Bamburi Cement quarries,
Vipingo (North Coast), there was just ONE Curlew
sandpiper among 5 that was in its full Breeding
plumage.(although the field guide of Kenya and
northern tz-Zimmerman, says that they are commonly
seen at around this time in their breeding plumage, it
was a sight..)

On thursday 28th July, Two guides from Haller Park and
myself were at Nguuni Wildlife Sanctuary. Also with us
was the resident bird guide. It was at about 9:00am
when we spotted a Little Bittern hiding among the
reeds making it very hard to spot, but we had a good
view of it when it took flight. the field guide of
Kenya and Northern Tanzania by Zimmerman states that
the bitterns have been recorded during or just after
the heavy rains.. So i guess the bittern is right on
time as the heavy rains seem to have passed but we
still get hit by sporadic showers.
Later that same day at about 5:45pm, at another pond
in the sanctuary, we saw a parent Three Banded Plover
running along the banks, with 2 of it&#39;s pullies.

On a later date (30th July, Saturday), with a group of
friends along Tiwi Beach, we saw around 7 Ruddy
Turnstones&#39; wearing their breeding plumage, foraging
along the shoreline in the exposed coral tidepools..

Happy Birding everyone,
Karim.
