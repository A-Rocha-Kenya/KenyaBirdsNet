  <pre>Greetings

A delightful outing by the Nature Kenya Sunday Birdwatch to Karura  
Forest on 18 December recorded Wahlberg&#39;s Honeybird and two beautiful  
Grey Cuckoo-Shrikes, among others. Mammals sighted were Sykes Monkey,  
Unstriped Ground Squirrel, Ochre Bush Squirrel and Bushbuck!

An impromptu visit to Aberdares National Park December 10-11 recorded  
flocks of Slender-billed Starlings near Chania and Karuru Falls â€“ and  
a black serval on the moorlands.

Wishing you all happy holidays and good birding, Fleur
