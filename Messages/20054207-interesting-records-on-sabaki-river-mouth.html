Dear Kenyan birders,
                                  During my usual field work on the Sabaki River Mouth I had various interesting sightings that I would like to communicate to the list.

I stayed at the site from the 29th of December to the 3rd of January.

Many white-throated bee-eaters particularly on the South Bank.

Hundreds of barn swallows feed in the area, forming big concentrations, especially on the dunes, I&#39;ve counted up to 400+ resting on the sand.[02-01-04] Most of them show really worn plumage.

1 female Eurasian marsh harrier, possibly the same individual seen on the 27th of November, is still hunting in the area. seen on the 29/12 and on the 3/01.

African skimmers present in the estuary in numbers oscillating from 1 to 10.

1 common black-headed gull among hundreds of the more usual sooty gulls.

4 Superb starlings not common in the area ( it was my first time to see them here after 10 months of regular surveys)[30-12-04]

1 cut-throat finch. apparently has been seen before (David Ngala pers.comm.) but is still a good record. The Bird Atlas of Kenya doesn&#39;t show presence of the species in the Malindi or the Sabaki squares.[30-12-04]

Rufous chatterers more confident than ever seen at least 4.

1 Abyssinian white-eye on the south bank.

...at last but not at least...

2 frigatebirds flying from north to south along the beach.[31-02-04] Even if in poor light I would identify them as two juvenile Lesser frigatebirds. White &#34;arm pits&#34; and light but not white head being the main features. 
If that is true it should be one of the few records for Kenya (4th?).
I&#39;ll submit a full description of the birds to the Rarity Committee.

interesting the big number of sooty gulls but the big flocks of terns seem to have disappeared..

that&#39;s all for now

Happy new year to everybody
