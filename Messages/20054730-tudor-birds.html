Dear All,

It is early in the morning so am making it my first task to write this bird news.

I have just been sitting in my bedroom watching the wonderful display of Eurasian Golden Orioles in the tall trees in next door&#39;s shamba. They have been and continue to be truly magnificent this year. They have been around in growing numbers from end of Feb and now there are dozens of them. Lots of juveniles. Two weeks ago they were joined by the Violet Backed Starlings and they are all feeding in the Neem trees. What a spectacle in the morning sun!  

Last week a Booted Eagle was in the low bushes of next door&#39;s garden, trying to preen, in the late afternoon, presumably before roosting, but was being harassed by the Common Bulbuls. He kept making half-hearted dashes at them but they seemed very unconcerned, continuing to to be a nuisance until he got fed up and flew further down the creek. 

Am happy to report that the Wood Owl is back after an absence of several weeks. 

Mombasa Bird Walk on Sat March 19th was at Haller Park where I am pleased to say, under the new management FFJ birdwalkers are welcome, free of charge. Quite a coup after 20 years of paying entrance fee!  The birds are pretty good at the lakes. Lots of Egrets and Herons easily and closely seen giving novice birders chance to identify them. The main sighting of the day was a male, female and juvenile Black Throated Wattleye. Good views for all the watchers. Haller Park and Nguuni, where we can no longer go, are the only two places I have actually seen it in Mombasa and very rarely. My first time to see a juvenile.

Happy birding everyone Marlene Reid (Mombasa)
