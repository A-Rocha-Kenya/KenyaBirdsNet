  <pre>Dear All,

I recieved this mail from Dr. Tom Butynski, any help will be highly 
appreciated;

Dear all
 
I am working on a paper in which I want to present a map (and 
database) of what we know of the distribution of the Springhare 
(Pedetes surdaster) in East Africa.  In East Africa, as elsewhere, 
the Springhare is often found in widely scattered, seemingly 
isolated, populations.  Many of these populations may now be in 
decline due to excessive hunting and habitat loss.
 
I am particularly interested in any observations of Springhares for 
Uganda as well as for sites in Kenya north of Naivasha / Gilgil / 
Athi River.  There is reference in the literature of Springhares in 
the Meru NP, Kora NR, Shaba NR, Samburu NR region....but I have yet 
to see Springhares in this region.  There seem to have never been 
any Springhares collected from any place in Kenya north of 
Naivasha / Gilgil / Athi River.  
 
In Uganda, the only verified records for Springhares are for the 
Kidepo Valley.
 
The only verified records for Tanzania are widely scattered....and 
the sites identified are few. 
 
There are no records whatsoever for southern Sudan or southern 
Ethiopia, but the species might well occur there.  
 
At least two species of birds are reported to use springhare burrows 
(Red-capped Lark Calandrella cinerea) and Southern Ant-eating Chat 
Myrmecocichla formicivora.  I&#39;d expect the Northern Anteater Chat M. 
aethiops to also use them.  
 
Would you, from the top of your head, please list those sites in 
Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, southern Sudan and southern Ethiopia where 
you have observed Springhares?  
 
Any records that you provide will be credited to your name in the 
database that I am maintaining for this species.
 
Many thanks for any records.
 
All best wishes,
 
Tom
