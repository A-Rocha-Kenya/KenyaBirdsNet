  <pre>Hello Kenya Birders: While at Sagala Lodge 25km  east of Voi adjacent Tsavo Park observed a singing indigo bird. The legs were pink rather reddish, and the song appeared to be that of Purple Indigobird. Earlier we identified a Jameson&#39;s Firefinch within a 100 meters of where we saw the indigobird. This was nearby buildings which concerned me that it really was a Village Indigobird. Can this be a Purple Indigobird??? Thank you for any help you can give me. Sincerely, duncan himes now home in Arizona USA
