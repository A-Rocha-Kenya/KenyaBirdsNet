  <pre>Hey all,
On Thursday evening, Charlotte, Emilly(both from
Lafarge Eco systems) and i were having a drink at
Campers Haven(Right next to Giriama Beach Hotel),
along the Jomo Kenyatta Public Beach.
It was about 6:15 in the evening, and the tide was
out..we first spotted 5 Yellow billed Storks feeding
in the tidepools, and it wasn&#39;t until we used our
bins, when we spotted 3 Black Herons doing the
&#34;CANOPY DANCE&#34; feeding right next to the Storks..
There were about 5 Whimbrels among other smaller
waders in the distance(which i didnt manage to
identify because they were quite far out and the
lighting was too poor for my bins)
Anyways, it was an interesting spot, considering the
amount of human activity at the public beach.
Happy Birding.
Karim.
