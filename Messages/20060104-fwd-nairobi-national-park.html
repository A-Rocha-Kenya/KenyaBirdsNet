&gt; 
&gt; Dear Itai-
&gt; I hope you are enjoying your holidays.
&gt; The following (worrying) news might be of interest
&gt; to Kenya birders &amp; their 
&gt; contacts:
&gt; Last night there was a fire in the north west of the
&gt; Nairobi National Park, 
&gt; though this morning (27th December) it seems to have
&gt; burnt/been put out.
&gt; Such a situation was bound to arise in the abscence
&gt; of controlled burning 
&gt; earlier in the year.
&gt; This further reduces the amount of grazing available
&gt; to the very large numbers 
&gt; of wild ungulates &amp; cattle now grazing in the park
&gt; (see 
&gt; www.nairobiparklions.org for details) in the very
&gt; dry conditions we are 
&gt; experiencing in Nairobi (&amp; still 3 months to go
&gt; before the rains!) 
&gt; 
&gt; More serious is the pollution of the
&gt; Mbagathi/Embakasi river -the one water 
&gt; source that can be relied upon to sustain the park
&gt; whatever the conditions.
&gt; Poisoned fish were reported 2 weeks ago. I spoke to
&gt; the Warden this morning 
&gt; after the rangers at Maasai Gate reported a mass
&gt; die-off of fish today.
&gt; His response? &#34;Still awaiting lab results!&#34;
&gt; At this rate the whole ecology of the river basin
&gt; will be poisoned, including 
&gt; the Finfoot &amp; the Pel&#39;s Owl we looked for! Not to
&gt; mention the thirsty mammals 
&gt; &amp; Maasai cattle!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Sadly this situation is reflection on the current
&gt; (in) ability ok KWS -a quick 
&gt; walk up the river would quickly identify the source
&gt; of what obviously toxic 
&gt; pollution upstream!
&gt; 
&gt; Best regards &amp; season&#39;s greetings,
&gt; 
&gt; Will

I rather go birding...
