Dear Friends

In contrast to nearby Tsavo National Park, Lake Jipe was in great shape this year with far more birds present that I have ever seen there before.  
Much of the reed bed seems to have disappeared from the section of lake shore southeast of the ranger station adjacent to the fence, and to the northwest of the station (outside the park) there are extensive pools between the reeds and the shore that were packed with birds.  
There were hundreds of herons, egrets and waders present as well as small numbers of ducks and other waterbirds.  
We visited there on 31 January for just a few hours and noted the following, which were undoubtedly only a fraction of the birds present:

Pink-backed Pelican  5
Long-tailed Cormorant  50
Black Heron  150
Squacco Heron  50
Purple Heron  2
Goliath Heron  1
Glossy Ibis  10
Fulvous Whistling-Duck  20
White-faced Whistling-Duck 10
White-backed Duck  2
Garganey  1
Black Crake  20+
Purple Swamphen  1
African Jacana  30
Long-toed Plover  50
Whiskered Tern  hundreds
White-winged Black Tern  tens
African Skimmer  60-100

The scene at the lakeshore was much as I imagine it must have been 30-40 years ago when the lake used to be a regular site for Lesser Jacanas and African Pygmy Goose.

If anyone has a chance to visit Lake Jipe in the next month or so I would recommend it.

Best wishes,

David
