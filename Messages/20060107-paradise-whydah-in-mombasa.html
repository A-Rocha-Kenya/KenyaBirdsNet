  <pre>Hi all,
  While conducting a bird survey yesterday (06/01/06) in the Bamburi North Quarry, north of mombasa, a single Paradise Whydah was recorded, among others. (The Whydah is a new record for the Bamburi Quarries&#39; bird data, with initial surveys dating back to 1991).
And today (07/01/06) while basking in the sun on the beach, north of Mombasa (again...) 5-6 individuals of Carmine bee eaters flew over and past us..Nice to have seen them around here, where as generally, a trip to Arabuko Forest would make this possible FOR ME..especially at the swamps near the New Tree house, where a fair number were recorded on a visit sometime last year..
  Happy birding to all,
  Karim..
