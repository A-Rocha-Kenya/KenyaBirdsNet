Hi everyone,

We have had an interesting sighting of Black Throated Wattle Eyes.
They have been around for a time and were coming to our 
grandaughter&#39;s
bedroom window every morning at about 7.30. Her room looks on to 
trees
and shrubs and is quiet and away from the rest of the garden. We are
very dry here at the moment and have had some interesting visitors to
our bird bath. Birds that are regulars here but do not usually come in
to the bird bath. Speckled Mousebirds, Lesser Honeyguide, Mombasa
Woodpecker, and Grey Headed Sparrow. 

A Happy New Year to all.

Maia Hemphill
