  <pre>&gt; Dear All,
&gt; I went into Nairobi Park today (15th January). It
&gt; was very hot and dry,
&gt; a few more dams are on their last legs now, Olmanyi
&gt; wont last a week,
&gt; Ruai will be gone next, shortly followed by Eland
&gt; Hollow. 
&gt; On the road towards Eland Hollow Dam I found a Taita
&gt; Fiscal which was
&gt; photographed. It is listed as occurring in Nairobi
&gt; NP in Williams
&gt; National Parks Guide, the record is uncited, and
&gt; there has not been a
&gt; record since. Perhaps this is a drought refugee,
&gt; whilst clearly a Taita
&gt; Fiscal the back is the whitest I have ever seen, and
&gt; very little black
&gt; shows apart from primaries, and a very narrow
&gt; collar. I wonder if this
&gt; has come from farther afield than Magadi Road. I
&gt; have enclosed a photo
&gt; with this report.
&gt; There were some thirty Athi Short-toed Larks on the
&gt; East Gate road, and
&gt; a female Golden-winged Sunbird in the dry scrub
&gt; alongside the cement
&gt; factory,
&gt; Normally at this time of year one or two Isabelline
&gt; Wheatears might be
&gt; expected in the Park, but today I encountered close
&gt; to fifty, so there
&gt; must be many hundreds spread over the entire Park.
&gt; These may also have
&gt; been pushed in by the unfavourable conditions we are
&gt; experiencing. There
&gt; were eight Pied but no Northern, which is rather
&gt; strange. Red-tailed
&gt; Shrikes were also more plentiful than normal for the
&gt; time of year with
&gt; some twenty birds fairly spread over the entire
&gt; Park. 
&gt; The main focus is still Athi Dam, shrinking but will
&gt; be gone before the
&gt; long rains if there is nothing in the meantime. The
&gt; Common Teal is still
&gt; there, if not around the edge on the open mud, it
&gt; may be resting in the
&gt; shadow of the trees on the causeway. There are also
&gt; nine Shoveler.
&gt; Avocets have now increased to four and have been
&gt; joined by three
&gt; Black-winged Stilts. Migrant waders were 15 Ruff, 20
&gt; Little Stint, 3
&gt; Marsh Sandpipers, 7 Greenshank, and 2 Common
&gt; Sandpipers. Also there were
&gt; one imm White Pelican and one White Stork amongst
&gt; the numerous Marabous,
&gt; Sacred Ibis and African Spoonbills.
&gt;  
&gt; I have received a phone-call from Steven Easley who
&gt; is currently leading
&gt; a tour in the country. At Siana Springs in the Mara
&gt; he had a
&gt; Semi-collared Flycatcher, Icterine Warbler and
&gt; Irania, and at the Hippo
&gt; Pools (Mara River) today, six Little Ringed Plovers
&gt; together, and two
&gt; Temmincks Stints.
&gt;  
&gt; Today (16th) another call this morning for a
&gt; breeding plumage
&gt; Brown-chested Lapwing amongst Black-wings on the
&gt; plains before Musiara
&gt; thornscrub and the descent to Musiara Swamp. This
&gt; was his 1000th Kenya
&gt; bird!!!!
&gt; A second phone call in the evening was to say that
&gt; on the Ahero rice
&gt; fields on the road in from Kisii, they had 20
&gt; Pratincoles flying high,
&gt; and he could not see any chestnut under the wings
&gt; and is 90% that they
&gt; were Black-winged Pratincoles, there were two
&gt; Black-rumped Waxbills
&gt; there as well (they are often at this spot in spite
&gt; of how far east it
&gt; is), on the way into Kisumu a Rufous-bellied Heron
&gt; on one of the
&gt; roadside ponds.
&gt; Brian

I rather go birding...
