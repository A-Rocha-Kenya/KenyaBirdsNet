  <pre>Thanks, Neil - all very interesting and useful. We&#39;ve been without phone lines for 4 days 
since my last email but that same morning (tues 16th - I was emailing between opening 
nets and first round...) we caught two retraps (one from 2002, the other an 05 bird) and 
a first year bird still juv head plumage. from what I can remember, none of our birds, or 
very few, are in moult at all while they are here - I&#39;ll double check on that however.

Have only heard my first one here at my place along the beach from the centre today so 
it seems they&#39;re just trickling in. I&#39;ll have a look at our data to see what ratio of ads to 
young and MM to FF as well. Some nice work to be done here and certainly the 
possibility of a joint paper. Late rains would seem to be a good explanation for the late 
arrival of them - almost a month later than in some years.

&gt; Hi Colin
&gt; 
&gt; We have long suspected that these natalensis visitors to the coast
&gt; have a SW origin rather than a simple southern one from the coast but
&gt; of course have no idea how far they have travelled. I do recall a bird
&gt; on Kifufu incorporating East Coast Akalat song phrases so perhaps some
&gt; of your birds do not move far. We know they do not move in numbers
&gt; through Mufindi and are not common as nocturnal migrants in Amani.
&gt; 
&gt; One day I&#39;ll get around to analysing our 1100 + ringing records.Terry,
&gt; this would keep you busy for a few weeks !!!
&gt; 
&gt; Colin, what&#39;s your sample size now ? there should be a joint paper
&gt; here somewhere.
&gt; 
&gt; Rains were VERY late this year and these are rains breeders. Moult is
&gt; critical for these birds, they have to leave breeding grounds before
&gt; they become too dry and burn. Adult males begin moult when females are
&gt; on eggs.
&gt; 
&gt; It was always complicated in the Pugu Hills because we had a small
&gt; resident breeding population there as well as passage birds and
&gt; &#34;winter&#34; visitors.
&gt; 
&gt; 1st arrivals would be adult males having completed moult on their
&gt; breeding grounds, 2nd batch would have the 1st young of the year and
&gt; remaining males, 3rd batch the last lot of imms and the 1st females,
&gt; 4th batch would be the remaining females, the last of these would
&gt; still be moulting inner secondaries such is their &#34;desire&#34; to migrate.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, it was never quite as simple as this of course but that&#39;s the
&gt; general pattern.
&gt; 
&gt; In reality we could be taking about waves of birds from different sub
&gt; populations.
&gt; 
&gt; So.. I would guess that your birds are late because the rains were
&gt; late on the breeding grounds and they waited a few extra weeks before
&gt; breeding.  Sadly no one working in coastal Tanzania any longer.
&gt; 
&gt; I would be interested in the ratio of imms to adults this year and a
&gt; comparison with previous years, this might give you a feel for
&gt; breeding success this year.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps
&gt;

&gt; a few days ago asking where were all the Red-capped Robin Chats I
&gt; heard the first one during church on sunday in Malindi! Did a bit of
&gt; env. education and pointed it out to the congregation which amused and
&gt; interested them all!! Still haven&#39;t had them at Mwamba yet however -
&gt; but understand one or two have been recorded in Arabuko-Sokoke. It&#39;s
&gt; very late for them, all the same and would be interesting to know if
&gt; any Tanzanians who get this (Neil?) have any idea why they may have
&gt; delayed so much.
