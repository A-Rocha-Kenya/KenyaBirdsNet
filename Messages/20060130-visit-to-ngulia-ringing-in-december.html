  <pre>At last I have managed  to cut and paste my word document


Fleur Ngweno, Catherine Ngarachu, Joseph Kariuki and I had a 24 + hour
trip to Ngulia and back to witness the major ringing exercise at Ngulia
lodge.

We left Nairobi at about 11 a.m. on Sunday 4th December and headed South
down the Mombasa road. Progress was slow until after the Machakos turn
as the road is very bad until there and compounded by many heavy lorries
slowing every vehicle down. The sooner this is dualled the better.
Thereafter the road improved until we reached the start of the E.U.
stretch, made good by Strabag, and what a pleasure it is to drive on
this stretch. Once the first stretch to Machakos and the last bit from
Mariakani to Mombasa are done, it will be a pleasure driving down there.

As soon as e entered the Tsavo gate at Mtito Andei our birding began,
and it was great especially with Fleur and Joseph helping us with
identification . It took nearly 4 hours to do 40 kms, as there seemed to
be birds in most trees and bushes. We saw:

Grey Heron, Wahlbergs Eagle, Martial Eagle, Crested Francolin, Yellow
necked spurfowl [10], Crested Bustard [2, calling], Hartlaubs Bustard
[2], Ring necked Dove [10], Laughing Dove [10], White bellied
Go-away-bird [4], Diederik Cuckoo, Little Swift [20], Speckled
moosebird, Grey headed Kingfisher, Eurasian Bee eater [3], Eurasian
Roller [40 or more], Abyssinian Scimitarbill, Red billed Hornbill [8],
Von der Deckens Hornbill [2], Spot flanked Barbet, Cardinal Woodpecker,
Barn Swallow [2], Red rumped Swallow [2], Lesser Striped Swallow [4],
Common bulbul [4], Common Rock Thrush, Spotted flycatcher [3],
Olivaceous Warbler [after a debate !], Common Whitethroat, African
Moustached Warbler, Rattling Cisticola, Northern White crowned Shrike
[2], Long-tailed Fiscal [4], Slate coloured Boubou, Common Drongo [4],
Eurasian Golden Oriole, Hildebrandts Starling [4], Superb Starling
[10], Fischers Starling [10], Yellow spotted Petronia, White browed
Sparrow-Weaver [4], Jacksons Golden-backed Weaver, Black Headed Weaver
[15], Chestnut weaver [2], Yellow Bishop, Red-billed Firefinch [4], Red
cheeked Cordon-bleu [2].

Of particular note was the number of Eurasian rollers, over 40,
seemingly very abundant !


We stayed at Ngulia lodge only one night and it was great to see it
full, not only of bird ringers from Europe, South Africa and Kenya, but
also with many tourists. Last time I was there my small party were the
only ones!

The ringing took place in the early hours of the morning from midnight
to 6 a.m., when there are thousands of birds flying around amongst all
the dudus attracted by the hotel floodlights. Many small birds were
caught and ringed, especially Marsh Warblers and Sprossers. An exercise
that looks painless for the birds.  Of note for me was a River Warbler,
which I was reliably informed I would rarely see in the wild.

By 9.a.m another session had started and we left there before they has
finished at around 11 am. I was very impressed with the dedication of
the ringers, real fortitude and patience!

Apart from all the warblers that were ringed, we saw hundreds of Little
Swifts flying around and nesting in the lodge, and also one Alpine
Swift. Other species noted at Ngulia were Cattle Egret [6], Black headed
Heron, Marabou Stork [10], Bateleur, Shikra, Augur Buzzard, Red-eyed
Dove [6], Ring necked dove [4], Laughing Dove [4], DArnauds Barbet,
Barn Swallow, Lesser Striped Swallow, Marsh Warbler, Nightingale,
Sprosser, Superb Starling and Black-headed Weaver.

A fascinating overnight stay, and I am sure we would have wished for
longer, but the lodge was fully booked.

One final visit to mention was that at Hunters Lodge on the return
journey. It looks as if it has been spruced up for new business, which I
am sure it will achieve, now that the road is so good around there. We
had a light lunch near the small lake, which looked good for several
birds, especially kingfishers. We saw 4 different species in 10
minutes!  [Giant, Grey headed, Malachite and Pied! Also of note were up
to 20 Black headed Heron nesting above the hotel. Fleur says this is a
traditional nesting site for Marabou and Black-headed Herons, but there
were no marabou nests on this visit. Many African Golden Weavers and a
few Grosbeak Weavers were nesting in the reeds. Other birds in sight
during our short stay were Cattle Egret, Green backed Heron, Hadada
Ibis, White-backed Vultures and a Black headed Oriole.

A most enjoyable 30 hours for all of us
