Dear Friends

Following on from Colin&#39;s comment on Paradise Whydahs on the coast I thought it might be worth mentioning that Tsavo East National Park seems to be rather birdless at present.  
I have just returned from leading a three-week Sunbird tour to Kenya during which we spent a day driving through Tsavo East from Voi to the Sala Gate. This is a route we follow every year on the tour at exactly the same time in January.  
In contrast to most years some species that I regard as common species were almost entirely absent. For example, we didn&#39;t see a single Eurasian Roller, Golden Oriole, Red-winged Lark, Chestnut-backed Sparrow-Lark, Barred Warbler or Common Whitethroat.  
Much of the park was very dry, though there were some bushes in fresh green leaf scattered about which created an impression of greenness that I suspect was superficial.  
I assume that many of the birds have simply left the park over the last few months due to lack of food.

Tied in with this were unusual sightings of &#39;Tsavo&#39; birds in adjacent areas.  Colin has already mentioned that we saw flocks of Paradise Whydahs at Mida, which is a species I have never seen on the coast before.  But perhaps even more surprising were flocks of hundreds of Chestnut-backed Sparrow-Larks at the Malindi Pipit site (some 12 km north of the Sabaki river bridge).  
I suspect that the presence of this inland nomad at coastal sites strongly indicates severe drought inland.  We also saw a Barred Warbler here which I have never seen on the coast before.  Golden Orioles were fairly common along the coast (for example, in the mangroves at Mida Creek).

The situation wasn&#39;t quite so bad in Tsavo West and we did see some Eurasian Rollers and a single Red-winged Lark on our drive northeast from Lake Jipe to Taita Hills.  
The only Common Whitethroat that we saw on the entire three-week trip was in the foothills of the Taita Hills - in a green, well-vegetated valley very unlike my impression of it&#39;s typical winter habitat.

Generally bird numbers were well down on average in most areas this year.

Best wishes,

David
