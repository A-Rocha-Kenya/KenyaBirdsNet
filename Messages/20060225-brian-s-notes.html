  <pre>&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; I went up to Mutubio Gate, Aberdares over the
&gt; weekend with Richard and Anne Bishop. Our best
&gt; discovery was not a bird, but something that will
&gt; make visiting this part of the Aberdares, much more
&gt; restful in future.
&gt; 
&gt; Two weeks ago Outdoor Africa opened a camp-site, at
&gt; the foot of the last climb up to Mutubio Gate, only
&gt; a ten minute drive away. This is being managed by
&gt; Alnavaz Amlani and his wife Mora. We stopped for
&gt; Java House Coffee and delicious Cinnamon Cake, but
&gt; the menu is varied and also interesting. Good
&gt; English-type old country fair with such rarely
&gt; met-with items as Stinging-nettle Soup.
&gt; 
&gt; It is operated as a camp-site, either self or
&gt; catered. You can either bring your own camping
&gt; equipment or they have theirs for hire.
&gt; 
&gt; This site makes a trip to the moorlands now so much
&gt; more comfortable without the necessity of having to
&gt; drive a long distance before arriving. Olive Ibis is
&gt; now on the doorstep, being in the bamboo just up the
&gt; road. The Sharpe&#39;s Longclaw reserve only a short
&gt; distance away.
&gt; 
&gt; Reservations or further details can be made by
&gt; phoning 050-50246 (satellite fixed line) or Mobile
&gt; 0722 715853
&gt; 
&gt; There is also a website..... www.outdoorafrica.org  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; email; alnavaz@oudoorafrica.org
&gt; 
&gt; Back to birds..... Surprisingly no Chiffchaff were
&gt; heard singing, though one was heard calling at
&gt; Mutubio Gate, it seems that in January they sing
&gt; after completing their moult when they are very
&gt; obvious and quite numerous, then are quiet until
&gt; March before they depart. Numerous Jackson&#39;s
&gt; Francolins, Hill Chats and Aberdare Cisticolas were
&gt; seen. Nothing of interest in the bird line but we
&gt; did stumble on a Leopard right by the track, and a
&gt; most beautiful Red (Harvey&#39;s) Duiker in the Hagenia
&gt; forest. The recent rains had brought out a few
&gt; butterflies and flowers, though only one Gladiolus
&gt; watsonoides. We had a light shower as we left the
&gt; Aberdares, descending to Mweiga. Then we took the
&gt; Solio Road to Naro Moru. Swifts were feeding low
&gt; over the plains, amongst them a few Common and
&gt; excellent views of about six Pallid. This is the
&gt; time of year that they are usually in Nairobi which
&gt; suggests that they are passage migrants from some
&gt; southern wintering grounds, (though the species is
&gt; not on the Kenyan list as yet). Along the fenceline
&gt; there were some forty Isabelline Wheatears, twenty
&gt; Red-tailed Shrikes, and one Whinchat that had
&gt; presumably wintered in the area.  A Whitethroat
&gt; sitting on the fence was behaving quite atypically.
&gt; Numerous Montagu&#39;s Harriers with smaller numbers of
&gt; Pallid and Eurasian Marsh, about twenty Lesser and
&gt; two Common Kestrels (and one Greater). At night we
&gt; spotlighted two Dusky Nightjars, interestingly
&gt; sitting a couple of feet above the ground on
&gt; branches, not on the ground. Eight of the large grey
&gt; Golden Jackals, five Steinbok and twenty Cape
&gt; Hares.... It was rather disappointing, for the lack
&gt; of sleep-time lost that night!
&gt; 
&gt; The next morning we left the lodge (good local rate
&gt; 10,000 Ksh for a triple on Dinner Bed and
&gt; Breakfast), to look for &#34;Vepres&#34; Black-lored
&gt; Babblers along the road up to Mt. Kenya NP entrance,
&gt; but only had to go a couple of kilometres before
&gt; finding a group. Of the Afro-tropicals possibly
&gt; displaced during the current drought, there were
&gt; fifteen Grey-headed Silverbills along the Solio
&gt; Road, and ten in the same place as the Babblers. The
&gt; Mweiga/Nyeri area has had substantial rain, the
&gt; shambas are green and healthy producing a lot of
&gt; food, and the cattle are fat and healthy, however on
&gt; reaching Karatina the climate is dry and there is no
&gt; water in the pond... after that it is all
&gt; drought-stricken on the way to Nairobi. Whilst we
&gt; were there Mt. Kenya was under thick black clouds
&gt; and was undeniably receiving a soaking.
&gt; 
&gt; Best birding 
&gt; 
&gt; Brian

I rather go birding...
