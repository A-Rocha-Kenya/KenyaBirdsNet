  <pre>Dear all,

unfortunately, a self activated message managed to get
through the YahooGroups &#34;gourdes&#34; and was sent to the
list under the subject &#34;you must see this Video clip&#34;.

there is no need to open this message and i have
already deleted it from the server.

other than that, hope to get more records from all of
you out there in the field as Migration has started
already - Steppe Eagles, Storks, Scops Owls and even
Sedge Warblers among many more... are already moving
through Israel.

all the best,
Itai

I rather go birding...
