&gt; 

&gt; Further to yesterday&#39;s communications.
&gt; 
&gt; Carefully nonchalant sms msg from JW, Anabel Harries
&gt; &amp; Frank Christopher on
&gt; &#39;Lark Plains&#39; - Wednesday morning, March 8, 2006. 
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Fox Kestrel catching giant dung beetles in flight,
&gt; magic!&#34;
&gt; And those immediately subsequent cell phone
&gt; exchanges regarding the risk of
&gt; causing you cardio-vascular irregularity - herewith
&gt; please find Annabel&#39;s
&gt; excellent hand-held record shots of the bird and a
&gt; brief tale of a russet
&gt; tail.
&gt; 
&gt; We found the bird entirely by chance, how else?
&gt; 
&gt; Mid cloudy morning on the outermost outwash fan of
&gt; Mount Meru I had decided
&gt; that we should undertake what I felt sure would be a
&gt; &#39;negative registration
&gt; transect&#39; for Beesley&#39;s Lark in the northeast sector
&gt; of the Osugat plain. So
&gt; we set off from the northern track that crosses the
&gt; plain walking southwards
&gt; three abreast, spaniel at heel, in the general
&gt; direction of Momella.  As
&gt; anticipated there were very few larks of any species
&gt; on the eroded and
&gt; close-cropped tussock sward of this sector.  A
&gt; couple of post-cyclone rains
&gt; ubiquitous dun-coloured Athi Short-toed Larks
&gt; fluttered-up ahead of us, one
&gt; even rose heavenwards to provide some faltering
&gt; song, a very small number of
&gt; itinerant Fischer&#39;s Sparrow-larks (ca 10) were
&gt; tracking westward across our
&gt; path into the open plain. Nothing at all to compare
&gt; with the symphony of
&gt; five larks enjoyed only an hour earlier in the
&gt; western sector. 
&gt; 
&gt; After a few minutes trudge yields one male Montagu&#39;s
&gt; Harrier, two Temminck&#39;s
&gt; Coursers and two Common Kestrels I notice a falcon
&gt; shape rise from the
&gt; ground 200 metres or so directly ahead of us, fly
&gt; fast and low to the right
&gt; then body-twist to neatly catch something small in
&gt; mid-air. Up go the bins,
&gt; and awareness goes into that million year old,
&gt; adrenalin-fueled   &#39;wild
&gt; image playback mode&#39; that some of us just know and
&gt; love: flash memory
&gt; comparison. &#34;Wing pattern like a Grasshopper Buzzard
&gt; , White-eyed Kestrel
&gt; body shape maybe, but that colour? Overall richer
&gt; than a Brahminy Kite and
&gt; that full paddle of a tail, it glows richly redder
&gt; than on any Red Kite.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; After a conscious inhalation I knew that such a
&gt; slim, red and acrobatic
&gt; falcon here in Africa must surely be Fox Kestrel,
&gt; distant memories hazily
&gt; recollected from the Sudanese border of Ethiopia on
&gt; Christmas Day 1993.
&gt; However, we must completely eliminate the
&gt; possibility of White-eyed which,
&gt; there being an arguably resident pair on the plain,
&gt; is a tad more likely at
&gt; this spot.
&gt; 
&gt; We walked on toward the bird&#39;s position, it had
&gt; dropped into a broad &#39;furrow
&gt; of dead ground&#39;. Gradually we got closer and Anabel
&gt; started taking some long
&gt; range record shots. The bird would not allow a close
&gt; approach but by
&gt; mingling into a large and fairly fast moving mass of
&gt; mammals; two hundred
&gt; piebald sheep, two Somali donkeys and two little
&gt; shepherd boys, who were all
&gt; closing from our right; heading in the same
&gt; direction straight toward the
&gt; kestrel - we were able to get a good bit closer and
&gt; Anabel secured a few
&gt; essential images. 
&gt; 
&gt; Over a period of perhaps one hour the bird mostly
&gt; perched on the sparsely
&gt; grassed ground, scanning attentively this way and
&gt; that, yet revealing little
&gt; more than head and shoulders. Intermittently it
&gt; would rise to fly on
&gt; &#39;beautifully elasticized wings&#39; low over the sward
&gt; before executing a neat
&gt; sideways flick to grab and dispatch a cruising dung
&gt; beetle. It would then
&gt; alight delicately on the ground and consume whatever
&gt; was required of the
&gt; beetle. 
&gt; 
&gt; Its incredibly rich colouration was a sight to
&gt; behold. In particular the
&gt; slightly graduated tail, the rump and mantle were a
&gt; glowing russet red in
&gt; the neutral light of that cloudy morning. At rest
&gt; the blackish primaries
&gt; contrasted very markedly with the rest of the bird.
&gt; We tried hard to
&gt; establish iris colour but could say only that they
&gt; appeared warmish,
&gt; definitely not white, maybe yellowish-brown. The
&gt; feet were yellow. In flight
&gt; the bird was always a joy to watch; the pale, almost
&gt; translucent, lightly
&gt; barred panel in the spread primaries was
&gt; conspicuous, especially pale when
&gt; seen from below or when the bird executed a sharp
&gt; turn to snatch a beetle.
&gt; 
&gt; After being chivvied along ahead of the grazing
&gt; sheep for some fifteen
&gt; minutes the bird began back-tracking, moving little
&gt; by little northwards
&gt; toward the main track.  Eventually it took off, rose
&gt; higher on deep downward
&gt; strokes the fifth or sixth of which was somehow
&gt; interrupted to give the
&gt; accelerating flight a very distinctive manner. After
&gt; achieving the desired
&gt; altitude or thermal position it circled buoyantly
&gt; into the now clearing sky.
&gt; It was then in company with two out of a group of
&gt; seven or so soaring Common
&gt; Kestrels who had been, somewhat clumsily, diving
&gt; earthwards to catch dung
&gt; beetles. When last seen it was drifting slowly
&gt; westwards at a height of
&gt; maybe 200 metres.
 
&gt; All in all: one of those absolutely superb breaks
&gt; that just make it all
&gt; worthwhile.
&gt;
&gt; James
