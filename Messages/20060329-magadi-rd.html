  <pre>Hi All!

On Saturday 10th June I went down the Magadi Road with Steve 
Collins. The main objective was to locate new sites for the 
butterfly Colotis fausta, in East Africa only known from this road. 
This was successful, and undoubtedly the species ranges into 
northern Tanzania.

A few birds were noted, the Shompole Swamp is extensive and although 
there is no open water available, and it was 3-00pm there was an 
African Reed Warbler (extremely patchy distribution in this country) 
in full song, and two Southern Red Bishops. An early morning visit 
to the swamp could be intersting. At the Magadi Hot Springs there 
were quite a few Curlew Sandpipers, and some fifteen Greenshank on 
Bird Rock. Blacksmith Plovers have chicks all over the place, and 
one Stilt was on its nest.

No signs that the Chestnut-banded Plovers were nesting though.

There are some colourless young White-throated Bee-eaters, though we 
found no evidence of nesting. These birds are a mystery.

There is a barrier across the road immediately after Magadi Town, 
where a representative demands Ksh 300 per person and Ksh 200 for a 
vehicle to continue along the road. This is a very steep toll, and 
is on a gazetted road so must be illegal. Not an insurmountable 
problem, as the fence constructed down towards the lake has at 
present no wire.  If they had demanded Ksh 50 for the car, it would 
have been far more reasonable, but I am afraid they have become too 
greedy.

Best birding 

Brian
