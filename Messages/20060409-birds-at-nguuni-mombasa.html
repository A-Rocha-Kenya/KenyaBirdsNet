  <hr/>
  <pre>Nguuni Farm (or Nature Park I believe it is now titled) used to be the star place in Mombasa for bird watching and was subject to a detailed survey by Colin Ryall and helpers during the early 90&#39;s. (Scopus Vol 15 Nos 1 &amp; 2). It has now become a family picnic site with a nature trail etc. Giraffes, Water Buck, Eland et al stalk round its open grasslands so it is not such a safe place to take a general bird walk unless one sticks to the demarcated walk which tends to be a little boring.

However a long 5 hour walk on an overcast morning last week turned up some good species (72 in all).

There were still many Red Backed Shrikes around, all looking very bright in new breeding dress. Lots of Spotted Flycatcher which generally tends to be the first migrant to arrive and the last to leave. One solitary Yellow Wagtail, a few waders, Wood Sandpipers, one Common Sandpiper and a couple of Greenshanks around the ponds. One Willow Warbler. Barn Swallows seemed to have disappeared but are often not that evident during the morning hours. Migrants apart there were so many birds. Most spectacular being the dozens of Carmine Bee-eaters, on every fence post and shrub. Another flock of Bee-eaters passed over but not identified. A lone Open Billed Stork, A Whalbergs Eagle, An immature Palm Nut Vulture, Greater Blue Earred, Superb and Violet Backed Starlings, several Sulphur Breasted Bush Shrikes, calling from every side. One or two briefly seen. Golden Palm and Black Headed Weavers busily nesting now there is some rain. Lots of Zanzibar Red Bishops. Common and Crimson Rumped Waxbill, latter not so often seen. The excitement of the walk was a pair of Senegal Plovers reputed (by one of the staff) to have 3 fairly new chicks.  No chicks were seen but we kept a good distance away for fear of inadvertently spooking the birds or even treading on the nest site. A sudden commotion while we were watching turned out to be an African Goshawk intent on taking one of the Plovers which immediately took to the air with Goshawk in hot pursuit. An amazing display of flying by both the Hawk and the Plover while we watched, with hearts in mouths, praying that the Plover would escape which thankfully he (or she) did. Hopefully the chicks did not fall prey to the Hawk.  The next excitement was several Nightjars seemingly flushed from their resting places by the many White Browed Robin Chats. With much deliberation, peering, counting spots, looking at wingbars, consulting the books etc we finally determined that the one we were staring at did have slight protrudence of tail feathers making it the Slender Tailed Nightjar.  

Good to know Nguuni is still having birds even though a lot of trees and scrub have been cleared and it has lost a lot of its wildness. Pray it does not fall to development like so much of that area. 

Access can be organised through Haller Park and a guide can be made available. Entry is 200/- resident and 500/- non-resident.
