  <pre>Greetings all,

I have been researching Mackinder&#39;s eagle owls in
unprotected areas near Kiawara and Gataragwa (not far
from Mweiga)for the past two years.  I&#39;m trying to
expand my research for comparison purposes into
Aberdares Nat&#39;l Park.  As I&#39;ve not spent much time in
the park, I&#39;m hoping those of you that have might
assist me with locations that you have seen
(preferably) or heard these owls within the park.
