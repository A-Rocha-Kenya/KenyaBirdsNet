  <pre>Dear Birders,

Apologies for this late report!   Easter Sat. at Huseini car track, Nguu Tatu looking for the last migrants.  Car track full of cars so a foray over to the far side of the dairyland where we saw about 6 Lesser Grey Shrike,  several Red Backed Shrike and both male and female Northern Wheatears. A couple of Spotted Flycatchers, a solitary Wood Sandpiper and a Red Necked Falcon.  The recent rain had revitalised the grassland and the large pond had considerably more wet patches than it has had for ages. African Black Crake, Three Banded Plover, Squacco Heron, Malachite Kingfisher, a lone Woolly Neck and a Black Headed Heron all round the pond.  No African Jacana there yet.  Hopefully they will come back. In the trees (the few still left) Violet Backed and Superb Starling, Yellow Fronted Canary. Plenty of Zanzibar Red Bishops round the reeds and grasses, a species which seems to have prolifereated during the drought.  Far off in the grassland and seen with difficulty a pair of Senegal Plovers. Wondered if they were the same pair I had seen at Nguuni Farm three weeks ago being harassed by a Goshawk.  Hope you all had great Easter birding.  Marlene Reid, Mombasa.
