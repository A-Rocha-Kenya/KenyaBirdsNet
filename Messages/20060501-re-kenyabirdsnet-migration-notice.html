&gt; Dear Itai,
&gt; 
&gt; I¹m rather new to Kenyan birds and so I have been
&gt; quietly reading reports to
&gt; kenyabirds to learn more about the boundaries of
&gt; ranges and what is and what
&gt; is not common.  In the last few weeks I have found
&gt; several Black-collared
&gt; Apalis around Karen and Langata.  Maybe I have just
&gt; overlooked this species
&gt; in the past but it does also seem like they have
&gt; just appeared where before
&gt; they were absent. I would love to hear your or the
&gt; group¹s thoughts on this
&gt; nice little bird. Thanks in advance for any ideas.
&gt; 
&gt; I¹m off on safari for two weeks tomorrow, so
&gt; apologies for any delays
&gt; responding.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,

Dear James,

Black-collared Apalis is a bird of what left from the
forests around Nairobi. it is mentioned in Zimmerman
et al. as fairly common between 1600-2400 m, but it is
known from the Nairobi area (Ngong, Karen, Karatu,
Langata, Arboretum and even in the Park -Kisembe
Forest).

i believe that what you witness is a cause of the
sever drought. since the Gardens in Karen, Langata
area are being well treated than the drought &#39;skip&#39;
them and they become a very big attraction (food wise)
to birds that are suffering from the drought in the
&#39;natural&#39; patches.

i am not sure what will the other members of the group
will think, but I&#39;m sending this also to the group and
let&#39;s see what will it bring up!?

all the best,
Itai

I rather go birding...
