  <pre>Yes, Mangrove K&#39;fishers definitely move with us here. None around until a couple of 
weeks ago and just the last 3 days we&#39;ve caught four - two previous year retraps 
including one today ringed in July 02 and two new - only one of which was a juv. Fry et 
al talk of them being partial migrants vacating coastal sites in Sept / Oct and going 
inland to breed returning in Feb / March. Some appear to visit Zanzibar during this 
period away from the coast. Would be interested to hear from anyone with records of 
Mangrove Kingfisher during the period Sept - March to try and work out exactly where 
DO they go? In many ways, their appearance together with other migrants from further 
south suggests they have some sort of South-north movement, though I guess there&#39;s 
no real reason for it to be as such.

Fry et al also talk of them only occuring within c.20km of the coast (tho&#39; then say they 
go to breed up to 50km inland..). on 1st Dec 2003 we caught and ringed a Full Adult at 
Ngulia which was VERY bizarre and must therefore be the most inland record for the 
species. 

Pygmys coming in in force this week too and we&#39;ve caught about 8-9 so far. Still no 
Red-capped however (any ideas what might have delayed them??) - and very 
interesting what you say about when and where you&#39;ve caught them in Tz. Clearly a 
LOT to find out about them. We certainly get our regular &#39;friends&#39; returning every year to 
the same nets as previous years so they&#39;re faithful to sites this end.

Mad Bee-eaters have petered out a little. Was some constant and good movement 10 
days ago over 4-5 days. 

SGT was in the main forest at the &#39;usual&#39; site near Gede forest station. Will be looking 
out for more (have had one at Mwamba in Oct 04 which was amazing...).

Always nice to catch s&#39;thing unusual for the site you ring - we had an immature 
Common Scimitarbill yesterday which was the first I&#39;ve even seen let alone catch right 
on the beach front. Doing its &#39;juvenile dispersal&#39; bit, I guess given it was in pretty much 
total juv plumage except for c.15% adult body feathers.

&gt; Hi Colin
&gt; 
&gt; Did not realise Mangrove Kingfisher moved with you !!!
&gt; 
&gt; would love to hear about more SGTs than just one !! was this at Gede
&gt; or with you ?
&gt; 
&gt; Presumably your Pygmy Kingfishers are the southern race ? we caught
&gt; one moving at night at Mufindi last week, 6 Pittas, 5 Harlequin Quails
&gt; and an African Crake as well as a very late Marsh warbler that was
&gt; underweight and did not survive being held overnight by factory staff.
&gt; 
&gt; In all her years ringing at Mufindi Liz only ever caught 1 Red-capped
&gt; Robin and we only caught one moving at night in the East Usambars yet
&gt; they are common, almost abundant as migrants in the Pugu Hills both
&gt; March-April and Sept/oct.
&gt; 
&gt; Madagascar Bee-eater movements most confusing, would be good to have
&gt; dates, numbers directions from as many folk as possible. I&#39;ll send you
&gt; our latest map for this species.
&gt; 
&gt; cheers
