&gt; In response to James Christian&#39;s query
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Black collared Apalis appeared in our garden in
&gt; Karen (Nandi road), where
&gt; there is lots of cover, some years ago - although
&gt; they might have been there
&gt; before and we&#39;d simply overlooked them as we were
&gt; not so keen on birding
&gt; then - you could trace them easily from their call -
&gt; very vocal  - and if
&gt; you moved quietly you could get quite close to them.
&gt;   We believe they bred
&gt; in the garden as at one time there was a family
&gt; party with young (2 I
&gt; think).   However, in the last year they seem to
&gt; have disappeared again.  
&gt; (We do not have a cat for obvious reasons, but of
&gt; late two or three
&gt; relatively well fed cats seem to have taken up part
&gt; time residence in the
&gt; garden - and we have been unable to get rid of them
&gt; - I sincerely hope they
&gt; are not the cause of the departure of the Apalis!)
