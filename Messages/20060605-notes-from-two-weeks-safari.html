  <pre>Hi All!

I have just completed somewhat of a whirlwind birding tour with four 
clients.  This time of year is generally regarded as quiet, because 
all of the Palaearctic migrants are back on their northern breeding 
grounds. Nevertheless in the 18 days we recorded 715 species seeing 
689 of them. Our 5000 km trip (we flew back from Mombasa) took us 
Thika-Kieni-Castle Forest-Shaba-Samburu-Naro Moru-Mweiga-Aberdares-
Nakuru-Baringo-Kerio-Kapenguria-Kakamega-Nambale-Kisumu-Kericho-Mara-
Magadi  Road-Nairobi NP-Taita Hills-Lake Jipe-Mida Creek-Gongoni-
Sokoke-Sabaki and on to Mombasa for the return.

What always amazes me is how common species just do not turn up, 
even in multiple visits to their habitat, it might mean that they 
are secretive, or there could be a withdrawal from the area for what 
we believe to be a sedentary species. Consider in 18 days not 
encountering any of the following.. Somali Ostrich, Black-crowned 
Night-Heron, Little Bittern, Spur-winged Goose, Black, White-backed 
and Maccoa Ducks, Palm-nut, White-headed, Hooded and Egyptian 
Vultures, Banded Snake-Eagle, any Harriers, Little Sparrowhawk, 
Cuckoo-Hawk, African Hawk and Verreaux&#39;s Eagles, Greater Kestrel, 
Peregrine, Hildebrandt&#39;s and Shelley&#39;s Francolins, Buttonquail, any 
Gallinules other than Moorhen and Coot, Greater Painted-Snipe, 
Temminck&#39;s Courser, Madagascar Pratincole, Yellow-throated 
Sandgrouse, Lemon Dove, Levaillant&#39;s Cuckoo, Barn and Marsh Owls, 
Donaldson-smith&#39;s, Dusky, Plain, Freckled Nightjars, Alpine Swift, 
Bohm&#39;s Spinetail, Somali Bee-eater, Short-tailed Lark, Grey-rumped 
Swallow, Montane Greenbul, Shrike Flycatcher, Mouse-coloured 
Sunbird, Northern Red Bishop, Peter&#39;s and Green-backed Twinspots, 
Abyssinian Crimsonwing and Black-faced Waxbill. Notice the 
incredible bias to non-cooperative non-passerines as to the far more 
cooperative passerines. Most of these species you would not think 
twice about seeing in their habitats, until you actually try looking 
for them!

Before the tour started,  on the morning of 11th May, I went into 
IUCN to check if the Nairobi Pipits were still occupying the same 
area. One was, and perhaps its mate was on a nest. Crowned Eagle was 
also displaying overhead.

 

So now the points of interest on the tour..

 

We started in Thika, and after lunch went up to Kieni. Here we were 
discovered by the Forest Guards who advised that anyone visiting 
this area must contact them so that they could provide an escort. 
The fellow to contact is Francis Kanuthu on mobile 0735 567 884 he 
is a very pleasant an accommodating person, but there is a safety 
issue in the area.

Walking down the tracks at Kieni was like being in a nuclear winter, 
hardly anything apart from Yellow-whiskered Greenbuls were calling, 
and although it had rained, there was no evidence of anything 
wanting to breed. Nothing at all of any note was discovered though 
there were parties of migrating Madagascar Bee-eaters flying high 
over the forest.

The next morning was in the grounds of the Blue Posts, the usual 
relicts were found, Brown-hooded Kingfisher, Grey-olive Greenbul, 
Black-throated Wattle-eye. The Brown-backed Scrub-Robin that used to 
be in the Lantana on the top, is now very much in evidence along the 
river.

Just on leaving Thika, the African Golden Weaver colony in the 
papyrus pool was in full swing, as were Yellow-crowned Bishops at 
Mwea.

This was to be my first visit to Castle Forest Lodge, sadly it 
rained much of the time we were there, but we had some nice walks in 
the dry spells. It is extremely beautiful, with the lodge placed on 
a cleared grassy area completely surrounded by pristine forest. 
There is no electricity, but paraffin lamps are provided at dusk. 
(best to have your own torch). The rooms were very tasteful and I 
was very pleasantly surprised, and the food perfectly adequate, 
although the coffee is unga! It is highly recommended for a local 
week-end and at no great distance from Nairobi. Sadly there were no 
sign of the Olive Ibis, but there was a Barred Long-tailed Cuckoo 
calling at dusk. Usual montane birds are all along the road.
