  <pre>Hi Colin

Did not realise Mangrove Kingfisher moved with you !!!

would love to hear about more SGTs than just one !! was this at Gede or with you ?

Presumably your Pygmy Kingfishers are the southern race ? we caught one moving at night at Mufindi last week, 6 Pittas, 5 Harlequin Quails and an African Crake as well as a very late Marsh warbler that was underweight and did not survive being held overnight by factory staff.

In all her years ringing at Mufindi Liz only ever caught 1 Red-capped Robin and we only caught one moving at night in the East Usambars yet they are common, almost abundant as migrants in the Pugu Hills both March-April and Sept/oct.

Madagascar Bee-eater movements most confusing, would be good to have dates, numbers directions from as many folk as possible. I&#39;ll send you our latest map for this species.

cheers

Neil
