  <pre>Dear birders, a quick update:

The big, hard cover edition of ³Birds of Kenya and Northern Tanzania² by
Zimmerman, Turner and Pearson is back at Text Book Centre, and I hope soon
at Nature Kenya!

In Nairobi National Park, wildebeest and zebra started returning to the park
last weekend, and zebras had reached Hyena Dam by July 29.

Wishing you good birding and reading, Fleur
