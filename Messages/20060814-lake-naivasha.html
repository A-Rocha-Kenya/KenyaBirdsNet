  <pre>Greetings

Lake Naivasha on 11 August 2006 was very low ­ Greater Flamingos wading all
over the northern part ­ but brimming with birds. Blue water lilies fringed
the lengthening tip of Crescent Island on the northeastern side. A Grey
Crowned Crane with two tiny chicks walked past the boat dock on the shore.
There were Whiskered Terns in breeding plumage, a Black-headed Gull in
non-breeding plumage, a pair of Lanner Falcons in the sky, and several large
rafts of Red-knobbed Coots on the water.

In the shade of the acacias at the KWS Hippo Camp there were many birds,
including a Greater Honeyguide and an African Thrush.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
