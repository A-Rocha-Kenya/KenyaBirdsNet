  <pre>Mombasa Bird Walk - Huseini Car Track, Nguu Tatu.

July and Aug are never very good times for birds in Mombasa.  The tourists come and the birds seem to disappear. The car track is now very dry but lots of water in the ponds. A couple of Wood Sandpipers and a lone Barn Swallow heralded the return of the Winter visitors.  Other birds of note, Allen&#39;s Gallinule at the pond, Mangrove Kingfisher, large flocks of Cattle Egrets (not so usual), Yellow Billed and Woolly Necked Storks.  Plenty of weaver nesting activity, Grosbeak, Golden Palm and Village.  Good to see a group of White Faced Tree Ducks which have been absent for ages.  Hopefully we will be seeing more migrants next month, already small flocks of waders are flying along the creeks and I can hear Whimbrels calling from my verandah.  Welcome to Mombasa Bird Walk any 3rd Sat in the month.  Marlene Reid - Mombasa
