Introduction
The Wildlife Conservation Society of Tanzania is organizing a
Birdwatching expedition to take place in Uluguru Mountains in the
weekend of 7th and 8th October 2006. The expedition is among the
activities planned by WCST to celebrate the World Birdwatch and World
Birdwatch Festival. World Birdwatch was established in 1993 to promote
the appreciation of nature through birding. During this time all
BirdLife partners across the globe, locally organize activities to
celebrate this important event.  
 
Immediately after completion of the expedition, a report which will
include a list of the birds identified and any other interesting
observations together with the names of the participants will be
written and submitted to BirdLife International. This expedition will
contribute to raising conservation awareness of Uluguru Mountains
which is the major important biodiversity area in Eastern Arc. Uluguru
Mountains is currently suffering an ever increasing human
encroachment. The expedition will as well contribute to the promotion
of avian tourism.

&#34;Through the World Bird Festival, BirdLife aims to raise public
awareness of the importance of birds and their habitats, and at the
same time, to promote the conservation of thousands of globally
important sites upon which most of the world&#39;s birds depend&#34; BirdLife
International.

Itinerary 
The expedition will start at 10.00am on the 6th October 2006 at the
Wildlife Conservation Society of Tanzania (WCST). WCST is located at
Garden Avenue opposite Mozambique Embassy.

Day1: Leave Dar at about 10.00am for Morogoro and drive to Tegetero
(5-6hrs). The evening can be spent watching birds of the forest edge. 

Day2: Leave very early (6.00) to the interior of Uluguru Mountains and
spend the whole day.

Day3: Drive back to Dar but stop at Kitulang&#39;alo Forest Reserve to do
birding in the miombo woodland

In case you would like to see more birding areas in Tanzania, we can
provide you with relevant information. Tanzania has very good birding
areas due to its magnificent habitat diversity that include large
rivers, lakes, plains, deltas and estuaries, montanes and coastal
forests, miombo and other woodlands and coastline habitats (e.g.
estuaries, saltpans, mangroves and lagoons) just to mention a few.


Important logistics:
WCST will organize a to and from Dar-Es-Salaam transport,
accommodation (shared tents/guest house in Tegetero) and Food. Tents
may not be shared if the number of participants will be small.
Remember to bring with you: hiking boots, waterproof and warm
clothing. This is supposed to be a dry season but the whole country
has been experiencing unpredictable rains.

The cost for this expedition per person will be USD130/£70/Euro105. 

Visa
For people coming from outside Tanzania, we advise that you check with
your nearest Tanzania consular for visa requirements. In case someone
