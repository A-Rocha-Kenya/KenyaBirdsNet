  <pre>Hi all
   
  This found its way to me. 
   
  Does anyone have any idea at all who these people are ? there are emailing american museums.
   
  WCST should perhaps ask around. Registrar of companies to begin with. Who are the shareholders and directors of this company ? Do TRA know about them ? Who does this post box belong to ? Do WD know about them ? Where did they learn the skills, at UDSM, at Mweka ? do they have Tawiri permits ? do Costech know about them ?
   
  Most grateful for any information.
   
  Neil
