  <pre>Dear Heather and all

Yes, there have been other reports of large roosting groups of African Pied
Wagtails, especially in August and September, and sometimes right in the
Nairobi city centre or the industrial area.

Does anyone know whether such flocks are part of post-breeding dispersal of
the young ones?

Speaking of flocks, Nature KenyaÂ¹s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk observed a
flock of Chestnut Weavers near a dam at Ruaka (at the junction of Limuru and
Banana Hill roads) on 13 September.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur

&gt; At least 50 African pied wagtails on the ground at the Uchumi Ngong Road
&gt; enclosed carpark around 6.30 last evening.  In the dim light it was
&gt; difficult to see if they were  adult or many immatures.      Is it usual
&gt; to get such numbers together?
