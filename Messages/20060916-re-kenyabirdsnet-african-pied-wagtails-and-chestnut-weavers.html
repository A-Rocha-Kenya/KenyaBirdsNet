  <pre>just got back from uk and saw your note . At the Junction near Dagoretti corner
, outside the front of the building there are at least  2 palm trees , into
which, at dusk, fly  many birds , say upto 50 or so and I  think they are
African Pied Wagtails. The Junction has only been open for 18 months or so ,
where were they before ?

&gt; Dear Heather and all
&gt;
&gt; Yes, there have been other reports of large roosting groups of African Pied
&gt; Wagtails, especially in August and September, and sometimes right in the
&gt; Nairobi city centre or the industrial area.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know whether such flocks are part of post-breeding dispersal of
&gt; the young ones?
&gt;
&gt; Speaking of flocks, Nature KenyaÂ¹s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk observed a
&gt; flock of Chestnut Weavers near a dam at Ruaka (at the junction of Limuru and
&gt; Banana Hill roads) on 13 September.
&gt;
&gt; Wishing you good birding, Fleur

&gt; &gt; At least 50 African pied wagtails on the ground at the Uchumi Ngong Road
&gt; &gt; enclosed carpark around 6.30 last evening.  In the dim light it was
&gt; &gt; difficult to see if they were  adult or many immatures.      Is it usual
&gt; &gt; to get such numbers together?
