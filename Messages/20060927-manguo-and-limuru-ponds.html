  <pre>Greetings

Nature KenyaÂ¹s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk visited Manguo and Limuru ponds in
Limuru on 27 September. Birds worth noting include southern and northern
migrants and local species:

Manguo Ponds
Madagascar Squacco Heron
Maccoa Duck (at least 5 males)
Red-knobbed Coot with chicks and nests
Cinnamon Bracken Warbler

Limuru Ponds
Little Stint
Ruff
Marsh Sandpiper
Green Sandpiper
Wood Sandpiper
Yellow Wagtail
Malachite Sunbird

We also met the Secretary of the Manguo Wetlands Conservation group, Patrick
Waithaka Kihika, who says the group needs advice and support to preserve the
site. 

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
