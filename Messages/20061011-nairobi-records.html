  <pre>Greetings

In Nairobi the jacarandas are gorgeous, but very few migrants have arrived.
A few local and migrant records:

Yellow-billed Egret and Common Squacco Heron, on the newly-formed floating
vegetation fringing the edges of Hyena dam, Nairobi National Park,
10.10.2006.

Eurasian Bee-eaters, on Wednesday Morning Birdwalks to Karura Forest, 4
October, and Windsor Golf and Country Club, 11 October.

Northern Wheatear, at the hillside with seasonal wetlands near Carnivore
Restaurant and Nairobi National Park, 8 October.

African Paradise Flycatcher, *white phase*, on the Birdwalk to Windsor Golf
and Country Club, 11 October (and as usual, African Golden Weavers nesting
near SpekeÂ¹s Weavers on the island in the small pond on the golf course).

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
