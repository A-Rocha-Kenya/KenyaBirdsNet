<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 color=navy face=Arial><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:navy'>Well, it was in West Kilimanjaro and back in
early September (oh one wonders how many species have become extinct since then?),
we were visiting &#8220;Hemingway&#8217;s&#8221; - the delightful new camp of Hoopoe
Safaris. It is situated within the administrative area of Olmolog village.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 color=navy face=Arial><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:navy'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 color=navy face=Arial><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:navy'>At midday on September 8<sup>th</sup> I
was birding with Hajji, who is Hoopoe&#8217;s on-site nature guide, we were on a
walk some two kilometres south west of camp. We visited a water hole &#8211; the
only surface fresh water for a long ways around - an open and partially
excavated pit with near vertical to 45 degree earthen banks. The hole is carefully
maintained and protected from wild ungulates by the local Maasai cattle-men in
order to provide water for their animals, for collecting some of their own drinking
water and for diluting the chemicals with which they &#8216;drench&#8217; their
cattle. The drench solution is, I believe applied in the normal manner, a pour-on
along the length of the animal&#8217;s middle backbone. It is applied there at
the site, right beside the pool, and is very effective against various ectoparasites,
as I understood it is used chiefly against ticks (and not against tick-peckers
per se). However in the wider environment it is also appears to be highly toxic
to some birds, and particularly it would seem to doves.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 color=navy face=Arial><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:navy'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 color=navy face=Arial><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:navy'>The problem seems to stem from the fact that
the animals are treated from one or two leaky plastic buckets and that these buckets,
containing significant residues of the drug one might assume, are being repeatedly
rinsed-out in the water hole, and presumably these buckets are refilled in the pool
each time the mixture has been used-up, and certainly after all the animals present
on that day have received their health-enhancing drench.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 color=navy face=Arial><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:navy'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 color=navy face=Arial><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:navy'>As to how often any one group of herders feels
obliged to repeat this procedure on their animals in the course of a year,
perhaps one dreads to think. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 color=navy face=Arial><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:navy'>We were told that cow herders, from the different
neighbouring communities, certainly bring their animals for treatment here on different
days of the week. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 color=navy face=Arial><span style='font-size:

<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 color=navy face=Arial><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:navy'>Hajji and I examined the discarded yellow
and red packaging of the drug that was discarded in a bush nearby but, as this interest
was evidently being quite carefully evaluated by our Maasai hosts, I declined
to make a note of the brand name let alone retain it. I keep meaning to go the
vets here in Arusha to see if I can find the same make!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 color=navy face=Arial><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:navy'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 color=navy face=Arial><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:navy'>On September 8<sup>th</sup> there were
corpses of doves literally all over the place. Stupefied doves of four species were
watched waddling around in the dust or floundering along the clay rim of the water
hole, two were floating in the water and about seven were lying in a pile in
the corner.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 color=navy face=Arial><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:navy'>The surface of the pool was strewn with a
scum of feathers and down, some of which a young boy was nonchalantly scooping away.
Moribund doves were perched in groups of from five to thirty-odd in at least five
acacia trees nearby. Several dove carcasses were lying about on the ground near
the pool, some were found many tens of metres from the pool and appeared as if
they had been carried there and the flesh partially or completely removed (often
only wings and tail remained yet these were more or less intact. Perhaps they
had been eaten by small wild carnivores, or by people even? Most poignant perhaps
were the dead doves a hanging, suspended on the acacia thorns &#8211; as if on the
ghoulish gibbet of hell&#8217;s keeper.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 color=navy face=Arial><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:navy'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 color=navy face=Arial><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:navy'>African Silverbills, Crimson-rumped
Waxbills and Parrot-billed Sparrows were also coming down to the water hole and
some were noted as &#8220;appearing to have been adversely affected by drinking
the water&#8221;. However no dead bird from these three species was found.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 color=navy face=Arial><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:navy'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 color=navy face=Arial><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:navy'>Obviously we felt obliged to dispense with
gentile political correctness and fraternally inform the Maasai of our opinions
on the spot; warning them that they were probably dealing death to more than crawling
dudu. Maasai workers at the camp were informed later that afternoon and all understood
quite well what was being suggested. They all utterly refuted the suggestion that
they might be poisoning the pool. Counter claims were made immediately. That
the doves were dying either through over-indulgence, greedily drinking too much
of the water, or that it was a special avian disease - some form of bird flu no
doubt - that the Maasai believed was more or less specific to the doves.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 color=navy face=Arial><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:navy'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 color=navy face=Arial><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:navy'>Since doves were converging to drink at
this pool from many kilometres around one wonders what impact this might be
having on the population, locally. One also wonders how often more or less the
same field trial is being replicated right across the African savannas; and all
supposedly in the cause of improved animal welfare.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 color=navy face=Arial><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:navy'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 color=navy face=Arial><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:navy'>One should certainly assume that the ever-expanding
use of pharmaceuticals on livestock; especially, but no means entirely, by partially-literate
pastoralists; can only be bad news for many constituents of the increasingly
hard-pressed non-human communities still out there, full of surprises, in the fabled
green hills of Africa.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 color=navy face=Arial><span style='font-size:

<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 color=navy face=Arial><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:navy'>And any wildlife enthusiast, especially those
recently in the rich world, should certainly appreciate the toll on nature that
has been wrought by the seemingly inexorable increase in the use of &#8216;beneficial
drugs&#8217; which have been inveigled onto farmers over the past fifty years. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

one form the Gelai side of Natron, the other from <st1:place w:st="on">West

<br>
now, on the Kenyabirdnet today there are also two reports of doves dying in
large numbers.<br>

been forwarded to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">South
