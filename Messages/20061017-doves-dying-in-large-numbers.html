  <hr/>
  we have quite recently rec'd two notices of doves dying in large numbers.<br><br>one form the Gelai side of Natron, the other from West Kili.<br><br>now, on the Kenyabirdnet today there are also two reports of doves dying in large numbers.<br><br>one of these from just north of Lake Magadi.<br><br>This is just to let everyone know that TGT collected samples and these have been forwarded to South Africa via the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Dar. No results yet but I'll let you all know when we hear anything.<br><br>grateful for any other similar observations.<br><br>one theory had the Masai washing out their tick dawa containers in the local dove watering hole.<br><br>Neil<br><br><br><BR><BR>Neil and Liz Baker, Tanzania Bird Atlas, P.O.
