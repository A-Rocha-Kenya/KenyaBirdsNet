Today in Oloolua Forest, Nature Kenya&#8217;s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk was treated to the rare sight of forest birds feeding in a frenzy on insects disturbed by safari ants. Right before us on the path, in full view and oblivious of our presence, we could see:<BR>
<BR>
Cabanis&#8217; Greenbul, White-starred Robin, R&uuml;ppell&#8217;s Robin-Chat, Cape Robin-Chat, White-eyed Slaty Flycatcher, African Paradise Flycatcher, Tropical Boubou and a family of Spectacled Weavers feasting on the insects, with Klaas&#8217;s Cuckoo, Black-throated Wattle-eye, Yellow-breasted Apalis, Black-backed Puffback, Collared Sunbird and Yellow-bellied Waxbill in the fringing vegetation.<BR>
<BR>
To visit the forest, get permission from the Education Department of the National Museums of Kenya.<BR>

Wishing you good birding, Fleur</SPAN></FONT>
