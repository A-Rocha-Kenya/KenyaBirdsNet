  <pre>Dear All,

I went into Nairobi Park today, to see if the migrants have found 
Kenya yet.

The place was quite full of Zebra, large numbers have moved in, and 
a few Wildebeeste.

On the Palaearctic front, very poor for waders, three Green 
Sandpipers scattered, at Athi Dam five Common Sandpipers, one Marsh, 
two Greenshank and four Little Stints even though the place looks 
attractive.

One orange Montagu&#39;s Harrier, two Booted Eagles at Hyena Dam, one 
Eurasian Hobby at Impala Lookout. Plenty of Barn Swallows, a few 
lutea Yellow Wagtails and a Spotted Flycatcher. One immature 
Eurasian Roller and a Northern Wheatear behind Hyena Dam, and 
Eurasian Bee-eaters widespread but small numbers.

As far as the Afrotropicals are concerned, a very nice adult Cuckoo-
Hawk on the edge of Kisembe Forest, Great and Yellow-billed and a 
Squacco in breeding plumage at Hyena Dam where there was also a 
Swamphen.

At Hyena Dam run-off the two juvenile Saddle-bills raised along the 
Mokoyiet, but no sign of the adults.

Four White Pelicans, two Spur-winged Plovers and a Collared 
Pratincole at Athi Dam.

Probably the commonest bird in the Park was Quail-Finch, but Zebra 
Waxbill was amazingly numerous with fifteen near the Hyena Dam run-
off mobbing a Leopard, several at Hyena Dam, ten at Olmanyi Dam, 
forty at Eland Hollow, eight on the Beacon Road, and others 
scattered in rank grassland, where the three widowbirds in non-
breeding plumage were particularly numerous for the time of year.

Best birding

Brian
