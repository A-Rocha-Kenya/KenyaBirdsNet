November opened with long-awaited rain in Nairobi, and it was a hardy group of birders who assembled at the Langi Langi cafeteria at the Museum for the Wednesday Morning Birdwalk. We opted to go to City Park to see the jacarandas at their best, including a City Park specialty, a white jacaranda.<BR>
<BR>
Several times during the morning we had to shelter from the rain in the bandstand or under trees, but the sun came out briefly as we reached the field near the river. The local birds were swarming in the trees, gobbling up termites. The male Black-backed Puffback puffed like a flying tennis ball and glared at us with glowing ruby red eyes.<BR>
<BR>
Migrants suddenly appeared out of nowhere: A small dark falcon, a pale dull warbler, a bright ginger-coloured Red-tailed Shrike &#8211; and a Nightingale, very pale except for its rufous tail, singing right in front of us.<BR>
<BR>
Wishing you good birding in the rain, Fleur</SPAN></FONT>
