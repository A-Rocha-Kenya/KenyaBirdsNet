Following a night of heavy rain, Dorrie Brass, Fleur Ng&#8217;weno and Rik de Baere (a delegate to the meeting on Climate Change) spent Sunday 12 November birding in Nairobi National Park. The rain impeded visibility until about 9:30 am, and limited our choice of routes for the rest of the day, but despite these constraints the group tallied a modest but satisfactory 100 species, with another ten or so not heard or seen by all.<BR>
<BR>
The rain had transformed the park from Brian&#8217;s description, all streams were full and rushing, and the few dams we managed to reach had high, turbid water. Highlights included:<BR>
<BR>
Pair of Lappet-faced Vulture with nearly fledged young<BR>
Very wet Martial Eagle near Impala lookout and then a pair near Hippo Pools, with a feathered young in the nest<BR>
Eurasian Hobby<BR>
Sooty Falcon, including an immature with &#8220;scalloped&#8221; upperparts<BR>
Crested Francolin<BR>
Hildebrandt&#8217;s Francolin<BR>
<BR>
Interesting also was what we did not see &#8211; no Yellow-necked Spurfowl or Ring-necked Dove.<BR>
<BR>
Wishing you good birding, Fleur</SPAN></FONT>
