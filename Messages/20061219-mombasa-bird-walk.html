<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>It was decided to take another look at the South 
Quarry, attached to Haller Park.&nbsp; An area which is still being worked but 
which has areas that are in the early stages of renovation with ponds, trees, 
grassland etc.&nbsp; Hoping to see migrant waders on the ponds we were 
disappointed to see only Common Sandpipers, about 6. The most prodigious bird 
had to&nbsp;be the Water Dikkop. There used to be huge number in the Central 
Quarry and it would seem that these have now all moved to greener pastures which 
has a lot more&nbsp;beach area on the ponds.&nbsp; On the whole less birds than 
in July when we last visited, most of the same species but fewer. Probably due 
to more disturbance from the quarrying activities.&nbsp; Interesting birds, Barn 
Swallows (not many), Ethiopian Swallows together with African Palm and Little 
Swifts drinking at the big pond.&nbsp; Three very fat Pied Kingfishers and a 
Malachite juvenile. Yellow fronted Canaries in the Casuarinas,&nbsp;Zanzibar Red 
Bishops, Malachite and Pied Kingfishers.&nbsp; Back at Haller Park animal 
sanctuary several Green Backed herons, which have been absent&nbsp;of late. Fish 
Eagle, Village Weavers busily nesting, and Palm Nut Vulture. Crested Crane and 
Marabou probably from the originally introduced species.&nbsp; Have a Happy 
Birding Christmas - Marlene Reid (Mombasa)</FONT></DIV></BODY></HTML>
