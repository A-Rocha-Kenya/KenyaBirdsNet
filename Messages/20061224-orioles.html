<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>At last the Eurasian Golden Orioles are passing 
through Tudor Creek.&nbsp; I have heard more than I have seen but one female 
seems to have taken up a stand in the tree nearest the verandah and I hear her 
discordant cries all day long.&nbsp; The other prominent member of the bird 
community is a superb Great Sparrow Hawk.&nbsp; Naturally much beleaguered by 
the crows which doesn't seem to bother him too much.&nbsp; They make sure they 
don't fly too near to him&nbsp;as he sits on the highest possible tree to preen 
in the early morning.&nbsp; Hope you all see lots of lovely birds this 
Christmas.&nbsp; Cheers Marlene Reid - Mombasa.</FONT></DIV></BODY></HTML>
