  <pre>Hi all,
Greetings hoping every one is having all the avian fun wherever they are.

HONESTLY speaking, it has taken me all my (nearly) 7 years of birding to see
juvenile Pied Crow despite being that common (atleast in kenya they nearly
every where in towns).

Could NEVER imagine finding a globally threatened E.A. endemic Abbott&#39;s Starling
nest twice before a noisy, brave, fearless and such a common Pied Crow.

Nesting on your way to Ol Doinyo Sapuk National Park (a tiny rarely visited
national park but great birding in and around the park. May be those heading to
Masai Mara National Reserve, which at the moment is under water should  re-route
to this tiny park.) past the Thika Army Barrack pass the small trading centre
and the large pilon crossing the road and over juicy pineaple plantation. the
nest is on the left post. Has two beggy youngones being fed.

If they aren&#39;t that difficult to other birders then they just played me a clean
7 year game?

BUT they just look like adults only having orangish red gape seeen when begging.
In fact i though may be we do see the immatures outside the nest but overlook
them to be adults.

Lots of rain over the area anyway, with African Golden Weavers, Purple-crested
Turaco, Zanzibar Sombre Greenbul, Northern Brownbuls at the main gate to the
park, Brown-hooded Kingfisher, African Moustached Warbler, Red and Yellow
Barbet and d&#39;Arnaud&#39;s Barbet, Long-crested Eagle. Havent&#39;s yet seen the
resident Red-capped Robin. Also my first time to see a Hermakop conference of
10 members together. afew yellow headed &#34;Yellow Wagtails&#34; lots of breeding
Yellow Bishops showing off and Red-headed Weaver.

all the best and breat birding year 2007
cheers
   chege



With Kind Regards
