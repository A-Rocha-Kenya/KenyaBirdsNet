  <pre>Greetings birders

Just as the drought really began to bite in Nairobi, the days became humid
as well as hot, clouds gathered, birds began to sing at 4 am instead of 6,
and since Tuesday Nairobi has had a downpour nearly every day or night.
The rain came thick and fast and much of it ran off, but quite a lot did
soak into the ground, and today Sunday there are pink rain lilies and green
blades of grass on the bare ground, and many of the city&#39;s Croton trees are
completely covered in hanging tassels of pale golden blossoms.

Highlights from a visit to Nairobi National Park on 4 March included:
An Ostrich family, with five young about two-thirds grown, two smaller ones
and one very small &#34;runt of the litter&#34;, apparently doing well.
A Kori Bustard, an immature Martial Eagle, two Eurasian Rollers and several
Pied and Isabelline Wheatears.

On 5 March at the hillside with seasonal wetlands at the edge of Nairobi
National Park, Whinchat, Northern and Isabelline Wheatears and Yellow
Wagtails in spring plumage.

Wishing you good birding,

Fleur
