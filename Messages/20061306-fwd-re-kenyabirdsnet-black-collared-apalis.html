&gt; Hi James,
&gt; With regards to Black-collared Apalis, we have
&gt; always had them in this
&gt; area. There are a number of pairs in the immediate
&gt; vicinity, they are a
&gt; prominent part of the dawn chorus especially after
&gt; rain, and well
&gt; adapted to garden life. Strangely whilst common in
&gt; the Mukoma Road
&gt; region of Langata, they are entirely absent from the
&gt; neighbouring
&gt; Nairobi National Park. The drought has had no effect
&gt; on numbers, though
&gt; they may be easier to see with the thinning of the
&gt; vegetation. Grey
&gt; Apalis resident in IUCN is also strangely absent
&gt; from the Park.
&gt; Best for now
&gt; Brian
&gt; My answer is at the bottom...

&gt; &gt; Dear Itai,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I¹m rather new to Kenyan birds and so I have been
&gt; &gt; quietly reading reports to
&gt; &gt; kenyabirds to learn more about the boundaries of
&gt; &gt; ranges and what is and what
&gt; &gt; is not common.  In the last few weeks I have found
&gt; &gt; several Black-collared
&gt; &gt; Apalis around Karen and Langata.  Maybe I have
&gt; just overlooked this 
&gt; &gt; species in the past but it does also seem like
&gt; they have
&gt; &gt; just appeared where before
&gt; &gt; they were absent. I would love to hear your or the
&gt; &gt; group¹s thoughts on this
&gt; &gt; nice little bird. Thanks in advance for any ideas.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I¹m off on safari for two weeks tomorrow, so
&gt; &gt; apologies for any delays
&gt; &gt; responding.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Cheers,

&gt; Dear James,
&gt; Black-collared Apalis is a bird of what left from
&gt; the
&gt; forests around Nairobi. it is mentioned in Zimmerman
&gt; et al. as fairly common between 1600-2400 m, but it
&gt; is
&gt; known from the Nairobi area (Ngong, Karen, Karatu,
&gt; Langata, Arboretum and even in the Park -Kisembe
&gt; Forest).
&gt; i believe that what you witness is a cause of the
&gt; sever drought. since the Gardens in Karen, Langata
&gt; area are being well treated than the drought &#39;skip&#39;
&gt; them and they become a very big attraction (food
&gt; wise)
&gt; to birds that are suffering from the drought in the
&gt; &#39;natural&#39; patches.
&gt; i am not sure what will the other members of the
&gt; group
&gt; will think, but I&#39;m sending this also to the group
&gt; and
&gt; let&#39;s see what will it bring up!?
&gt; all the best,
&gt; Itai
&gt; I rather go birding...
