  <pre>Hi Birders,

A weekend Outing for World Bird Festival 2006 at Ol Donyo Sabuk bore a 
number of birds of interest. It was almost a year since visiting the 
park late December 05(12th Dec)when i saw the bird. Again i a pair or more of Red-capped Robin-chat last Sunday(26th Nov 06). As well, local at Thika but rare spotted the Purple-crested Turaco. 

Also seen were:-
Pale Flycatcher
Spotted Flycatcher 
Barn Swallow

A stop at Thika Sewage Treatment, bore Yellow Wagtail,Isabelline 
Wheatear, Southern Pochard(2), Whiskered Tern, Ruff among other 
waders.

Birding take you far.

Joshua
