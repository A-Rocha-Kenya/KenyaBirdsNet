Hi Neil,
 
I believe there are still a large number of copies of Birds of East Africa  
for sale at Nature Kenya at NMK....at a reduced price.  I do not recall the  
price.  Contact:  
 
_catherine@naturekenya.org_ (mailto:catherine@naturekenya.org) ,
 
 I still find this book very useful....especially the Gazetteer.
 
Cheers, Tom

does  anyone know if an electronic version exists of  Birds of East Africa  ?

would anyone have any objections to one being circulated ?

are  there any hardback copies left anywhere ?

many  thanks
