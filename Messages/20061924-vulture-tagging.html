  <pre>Dear all,



Last week, Simon Thomsett, Paul Kirui and I wing-tagged a few vultures. Birds caught in the Mara have orange tags and those caught in the Athi Kapiti plains have yellow tags. So far we have managed to wing-tag four birds (two Ruppell&#39;s and two African White-backed Vultures). The aim of the wing-tagging is to document movements of vultures and to enhance awareness about the importance of vultures. 



Many thanks to Mara Senior Warden Mr Koikai for his support and cooperation in this matter.



Attached is a picture of a Ruppells tagged last week.

 

If you see these birds with tags on, kindly email me with details of number and location (preferably a GPS location). 



Neil, we would like to assist with vulture wing-tagging in Tanzania. How can we help? Can I send tags over?



 

Cheers,

 

Munir Virani
