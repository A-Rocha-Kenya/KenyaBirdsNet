Hi all

 

We had our first (known to me) significant case of 
poisoning of vultures last year. I still await real
details but at least 80 birds (they will have been
mainly White-backed)died around a waterhole in the
Ruaha River within Ruaha NP after feeding on the
poisoned carcases of a Zebra and a Giraffe. An
agricultural poison was used.

 

ccing to Mr Lejora Chief Ecologist at TANAPA who may
have full details to share witth us.

Neil

Dear Paul

As Derek talks of the vultures poisoning in Uganda i
probably think this is the
same in kenya.

I know three case of such poisoning on the edge of
Masai Mara National Reserve,
that&#39;s at Olololoo Escarpment one case killing over 40
individual of vultures.
Two of the cases i heard from the locals which
proabaly means more unknown
cases.

All this cases were that the cattle/goat/sheep owners
were targeting leopards
after killing their animals. Asking if they thought
they got their target dead
they aren&#39;t sure they died.

May be Paul Kirui, a mara resident safari guide (I
know he is a vulture man)
could comments or have more accurate figure of cases
than mine. I copy this mail
to him hopefully he&#39;ll check


With Kind Regards

&gt; Dear Derek
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for information. I wonder whether John has
anything to say about
&gt; the Grey Parrots at the moment
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers

&gt; 
&gt; Dear Paul,
&gt; 
&gt; Of the species known from Uganda, I think that all
of the vultures are
&gt; likely to be in trouble (from poisoning of predators
etc) but we only
&gt; have
&gt; evidence, no actual counts.
&gt; 
&gt; John Bosco Amuno, to whom this is copied, is
starting a study of the
&gt; Grey
&gt; Parrot in Uganda and will be making some population
estimates and
&gt; collecting
&gt; data on trade and any changes in its status. But he
may say &#39;come back
&gt; in 2
&gt; year&#39;s time&#39;!
&gt; 
&gt; Best wishes,
&gt; 
&gt; Derek Pomeroy
