  <pre>Just heard from Graeme at the Ringing Scheme of EA re the Lesser Black-backed Gull 
I saw during the waterbird counts with a colour ring:


Your LB-b G had been ringed as a pull in NORWAY, their FIRST to Kenya and their 
furthest south! 

The distance is 7953 km, 150 degree bearing, 190 d elapsed time.
