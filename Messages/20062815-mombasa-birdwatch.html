<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The weather has been so wet here I feared that it 
would not be possible to get my vehicle up to Nguu Tatu, our target area. We had 
arranged to do our serious birding on Weds 8th. 7th had been wet early in the 
morning and dry from about 10 a.m. so hoping for the best Myself, Kelvin Mazera 
and Samson drove off into the hills. We decided to start with Nguuni where there 
is some shelter and in fact the first two hours were spent spotting from the 
picnic banda and drinking hot coffee. Amazing how many bird feed in the rain. 
Bare Eyed Thrush, Superb and Greater Blue Earred Starlings, Emerald Spotted Wood 
Dove, Common Sandpiper (who thought all the world was a lake), Sulpher Breasted 
Bush Shrike calling, White Faced Whistling Ducks flying over, Black Headed 
Heron, Golden Palm Weavers and Emeral Spotted Wood Doves. Lots of Pale and 
Spotted Flycatchers. Once the rain stopped (for about 5 minutes) we paddled 
round the site.&nbsp; An African Darter drying his wings made a spectactular 
sight. The Zanzibar Red Bishops were very many, males in bright breeding dress. 
The afternoon was spent sliding round Nguu Tatu where we made up the list of 74 
species. About 20 less than I was expecting. Hardly any migrants, not many Barn 
Swallows. A couple of Red Backed Shrikes and as mentioned Spotted Flycatchers, 
&nbsp;a couple of Olivaceous Warblers, a Wood and a Common Sandpiper. 
&nbsp;Other birds of interest: Black Shouldered Kite, Whalberg's Eagle, Pangani 
and Yellow Throated Longclaw. Northern and Red Faced Crombecs, an African 
Goshawk on a hunt, a male and female Black Cuckoo Shrike, a female African 
Golden Oriole, a Kestrel flying high (no positive ID) and lots of other 
wonderful common birds of the area which we never get tired of.&nbsp; Plenty 
more days left for Birdwatch birding. Let's get out there!&nbsp; Marlene Reid
