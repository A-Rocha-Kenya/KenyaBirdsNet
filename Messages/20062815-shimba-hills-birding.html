<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The advent of Birdwatch month got off to a good 
start at the coast with Shimba Support Group organising a week-end of birding in 
the park, incorporating Birdwatch and an ongoing listing of birds in the area. 
Mombasa birders joined the group on Sun arriving at the main gate at around 8.20 
(ferry working well for a change) just in time to catch a bird feeding party 
eating lots of small moths.&nbsp; Retz's Red Bill Shrikes, Yellowbill, Dark 
Backed Weavers, Crowned Hornbill, Brown Hooded Kingfisher (behaving like a 
Bee-Eater), Yellow Bellied Greenbul, Black Backed Puffback, Green Barbet, Bronze 
Mannikin, Tropical Boubou, Drongo, Palm and Little Swifts flying low to join the 
feast, Fischers Turaco not actually in the party but honking in the background 
and a Common Bulbul. Fifteen species before setting foot inside the park proper 
was an encouraging sign&nbsp;especially when we heard the Sat. watch had turned 
up&nbsp;only 10 birds all day due to heavy rain. As we had a game warden with us 
we were able to walk in the park in some areas. Another feeding party in the 
forest below Sable Bandas turned up Little Yellow Flycatcher, Grey Headed 
Bushshrike, Green Pigeon, White Earred Barbet, Fischers Greenbul calling, 
Cameroptera, and Black Headed Oriole. Dodging the rain for the rest of day as 
best we could, sheltering at the look out point and in the banda at Makadara 
picnic site we manged to have a list of 40 birds which is not bad for one day in 
Shimba Hills. It included 3 White Headed Vultures (not seen by me before in this 
park), Silvery Cheeked, Trumpeter and Crowned Hornbills, Palm Nut Vulture, 
Bataleur Eagle, Red Billed Oxpeckers on Buffaloes. Hardly any migrants, one very 
wet Red Backed Shrike, several Barn Swallows.&nbsp; A foray down to Marere Dam 
at the end of the day turned up Brown Headed Parrots, Black Saw Wing Swallows, 
and Greater Blue Earred Starlings. Unfortunately the Bee-Eaters "got away" while 
we were struggling to park the car on the erroded and slippery road.&nbsp; A 
good if wet start to Birdwatch for us coasties even if I am still picking off 
the pepper ticks. Have a great Birdwatch. Marlene Reid -
