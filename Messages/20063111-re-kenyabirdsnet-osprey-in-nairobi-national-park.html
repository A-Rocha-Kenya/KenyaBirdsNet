  <pre>sorry for late posting i&#39;m trying this the third time.


Dear all
On sat 8th April, John Gabriel, his colleague Morris
and I visited Nairobi National Park. The weather was
particularly not encouraging. Rainy in the early
morning, chilly till nearly 1300hrs and some sun
shines.
However,we had good views of a single Osprey near the
main gate, 2 Curlew Sandpipers at the Athi Dam (be
carefully itÂ’s all muddy black-cotton of course), 5
Eurasian Golden Oriole, over 20 Red-backed Shrike,
Lesser Grey Shrike, single Fulvous Whistling Duck at
the Athi Dam, very few Barn Swallows and Willow
Warblers. 

After all my best day in the park with Osprey then
after, an adult Cheetah with two near-grown up kids
then an hour later a leopard

cheers
