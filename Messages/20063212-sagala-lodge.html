  <pre>Dear All    

The old Ndara Ranch has always been a favourite birding spot of mine but due to recent refurbishing and change of ownership etc I have not been up there for some time.  FFJ were organising an overnight stay so I decided to go along, taking an extra day to do some solitary birding. I am delighted to say that it is still just marvellous for birding. A list of 75 species in 48 hours with one lifer, Grey Headed Silver Bill, a small flock of about 8.  The unfortunate thing is that due to the large number of elephants in the area it is no longer to wander the bush at will as I used to do. Maybe when the rain (we actually had a storm and night of rain) comes, the elephants will move back into the park. However the dry also kept the birds around the garden and a good look-out over the bush, has been built with a small pool which attracted a large flock of Black Faced Sandgrouse (not previously on my Ndara list). Golden Breasted Starlings were many, Paradise Whydahs, Grey Headed Bush Shrike, Eastern Violet Backed Sunbird, Hunters Sunbird (not so many as previously due to the cutting of the pencil Euphorbia round the pool), Shrikra, flock of Common Steppe Buzzards flying over at noon on Sat.  Rufous Bush Chat, Blue Naped and White Headed Mousebirds, one Madagascar Bee-Eater, D&#39;Arnaud&#39;s and Red and Yellow Barbets, African Black Swift, Mouse Coloured Penduline Tits, Black Throated Barbets, Black Necked Weavers, a Spotted Eagle Owl popping out of a tree at dusk, Vulterine Guinea Fowl which come to the garden to feed, not to mention the fast flying falcon (too fast for my eyes), dark orange underparts and dark wing tips  (could it have been a Taita Falcon?). Always living in hope of seeing that elusive bird.  Sagala is a good place to go birding. Most of these birds were round the garden, easily seen, a great place for the not so experienced birder or for birding groups.  I was able to expand my old Ndara list from 162 species to 174 and leave it with the management.  

My original intention of getting to Jipe was not possible due to time and wet weather in that area.  Pity as I hear birds there were great.  Next time. Happy birding Marlene Reid (Mombasa)
