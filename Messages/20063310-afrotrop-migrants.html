  <pre>The Afrotropical migrants are well and truly coming back in now with Pygmy 
Kingfishers in good numbers, Mangrove Kingfishers back (one adult ringed this 
morning), and Madagascar Bee-eaters moving through in flocks of 5-20 the past week 
or so. Red-capped Robin Chats are late back however and not recorded yet. One 
Spotted Ground Thrush is good news. Pal waders are heavily reduced in number now 
and the last of the Eu. Golden Orioles has just about gone. 

The rains have been the better during April than any year since 1999 which is good with 
pools filling and the promise of waterbirds once again. 

Good birding!
