  <pre>NORTH STAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSMITTER GRANT
PROGRAM - North Star Science and Technology, LLC and
American Bird Conservancy announce the 5th annual
North Star Science and Technology Transmitter Grant
Program.  In the spirit of giving back to the research
community that they serve, North Star will award a
total of eight (8) satellite transmitters (Argos
Platform Transmitter Terminals (PTTs)), to one or two
recipients (8 PTTs to one project or 4 PTTs to each of
two projects). PTTs are powerful, cutting-edge tools
for the study of bird migration that greatly extend
the range over which individual birds can be tracked. 
The program is open to projects throughout the world.
Research that contributes to our knowledge of avian
biology and that provides data useful for bird
conservation, particularly of threatened species, will
receive preference in the selection process. American
Bird Conservancy (http://www.abcbirds.org) will handle
the proposal submission process, review proposals, and
select the winning projects. Please see
http://www.northstarst.com for more information and
proposal guidelines.  Deadline for proposals is
February 2, 2007.  Any further questions about the
program can be directed to George E. Wallace, American
Bird Conservancy (EM: gwallace@abcbirds.org; PH:
540-253-5780; FX: 540-253-5782).
