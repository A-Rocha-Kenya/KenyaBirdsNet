  <pre>Hi Colleagues

An upcoming birdwatcher based in Isiolo is organising
a group to watch birds especially during the world
bird festival. He however doesn&#39;t have even a single
pair of binoculars. Could anybody be willing to led
him a pair/pairs??

Hi name is Jirma (cell 0725535095; email:
jirmae@yahoo.com). He frequents Nairobi and
arrangements can be made for him to collect any offer.

would be great to motivate continued birdwatching
especially for such little-visited places
