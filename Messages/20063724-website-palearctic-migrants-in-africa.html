  <pre>&gt; Dear all,
&gt; 
&gt; Hope you are doing well, greetings from the - now
&gt; increasingly dark and 
&gt; cold... - Netherlands.
&gt; 
&gt; This is to draw your attention to a new webbased
&gt; database on Palearctic 
&gt; migrants in Africa:
&gt; www.macroecology.ku.dk/africamigrants. It is set up
&gt; by 
&gt; the Center for Macroecology of the University of
&gt; Copenhagen in Denmark. The 
&gt; site can be used to:
&gt; 
&gt; - download our publications on Palearctic migrants
&gt; in Africa
&gt; - download a list of Western Palearctic bird species
&gt; migrating within Africa
&gt; - download geo-referenced records on the
&gt; distribution of Palearctic migrants 
&gt; in Africa
&gt; - enter new records for Palearctic migrants in
&gt; Africa
&gt; - find useful links to other websites dealing with
&gt; bird migration
&gt; 
&gt; Much data that was brough together by observers over
&gt; the last few years, 
&gt; notably from observers in Kenya (by using the
&gt; special migrant-forms, later 
&gt; also from Birdfinder), went into this database. Much
&gt; of the site is still 
&gt; under construction and comments are welcomed by the
&gt; makers. Please feel free 
&gt; to spread this information further, for example on
&gt; Kenyabirdsnet.
&gt; 
&gt; Initiatives like these seem to be popping up and I
&gt; sometimes wonder how many 
&gt; wheels are invented simultaneously in different
&gt; places. Anyway, I suppose it 
&gt; helps to be aware of and link up to promising
&gt; projects as much as possible, 
&gt; and this may be one of them.
&gt; 
&gt; With best wishes,
&gt; 
&gt; Bernd de Bruijn
&gt;
