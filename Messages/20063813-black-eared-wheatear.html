  <pre>Dear all,
 
I&#39;ve had a short trip to Solio ranch last weekend. many migrants around, mainly Yellow Wagtails but also a single Black Stork, Green Sandpipers, Steppe Buzzard  and few Spotted Flycatchers and Pied Wheatears. 
 
the most interesting record though was of a beautiful male Black-eared Wheatear of the eastern race with no black on the throat. the bird was seen in the middle of the ranch on one of the cattle fences. next to it a nice male Northern Wheatear was a nice comparison.
 
all the best and great birding,
Itai
 
I rather go birding...
