  <pre>...following my email a few days ago asking where were all the Red-capped Robin 
Chats I heard the first one during church on sunday in Malindi! Did a bit of env. 
education and pointed it out to the congregation which amused and interested them 
all!! Still haven&#39;t had them at Mwamba yet however - but understand one or two have 
been recorded in Arabuko-Sokoke. It&#39;s very late for them, all the same and would be 
interesting to know if any Tanzanians who get this (Neil?) have any idea why they may 
have delayed so much.
