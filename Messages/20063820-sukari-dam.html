  <pre>Greetings

On an unusually warm and sunny August 20, the Nature Kenya Sunday Birdwatch
visited Sukari Dam at Brookside Dairies on Waunyomu Ngeke Ranch northeast of
Nairobi. The dam surface is overrun with Water Hyacinth, which looked brown
and withered today. Is it the work of the introduced beetle, or due to the
cold of the past six weeks? Highlights of the morning include:

Over 122 Grey Crowned Cranes
4 Spur-winged Geese
Two WahlbergÂ¹s Eagles
And a very handsome male Red-headed Weaver

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
