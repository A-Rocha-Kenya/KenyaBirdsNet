  <pre>Hi all.

Alawi Hija  rang me this morning, c 600 Roseates around those two small mushroom stacks of Chumbe, Zanzibar. He climbed one stack and found very young chicks.

Alawi, please let us have full details asap. Excellent news and at just the right time of the year.

Tony, how does this fit in with breeding further south ?

Anyone know anyone on Mafia at the moment, it would be good to check other possible colonies.

Coiln, what about the Kenya coast ?
