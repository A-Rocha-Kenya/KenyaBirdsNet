  <hr/>
  <pre>&gt; If you belong to ANY Yahoo Groups - be aware that
&gt; Yahoo is now using &#34;Web Beacons&#34; to track every
&gt; Yahoo
&gt; Group user. It&#39;s similar to cookies, but allows
&gt; Yahoo
&gt; to record every website and every group you visit,
&gt; even when you&#39;re not connected to Yahoo.
&gt; 
&gt; Look at their updated privacy statement at  
&gt; &lt;http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy&gt;
&gt; http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy .
&gt; 
&gt; About half-way down the page, in the section on
&gt; cookies, you will see a link that says WEB BEACONS.
&gt; 
&gt; Click on the phrase &#34;Web Beacons.&#34; On the page that
&gt; opens, find a paragraph entitled &#34;Outside the Yahoo
&gt; Network.&#34; In that section find a little &#34;Click Here
&gt; to
&gt; Opt Out&#34; link that will let you &#34;opt-out&#34; of their
&gt; snooping. Be careful! NOT to click on the next
&gt; button
&gt; shown. It is an &#34;Opt Back In&#34; button that, if
&gt; clicked,
&gt; will UNDO the opt-out.
&gt; 
&gt; Note that Yahoo&#39;s invasion of your privacy - and
&gt; your
&gt; ability to opt-out of it - is not user-specific. It
&gt; is
&gt; MACHINE specific. That means  you will have to
&gt; opt-out
&gt; on every computer (and browser) you use. Please
&gt; forward this to your other groups. You might
&gt; complain,
&gt; too,  but I&#39;m not sure if anyone is listening..

&gt; Controversy Yahoo&#39;s current privacy policy is
&gt; causing
&gt; consternation among some users who object to their
&gt; use
&gt; of so-called &#39;web beacons&#39;. Known in most circles as
&gt; web bugs, these invisible images are embedded in
&gt; websites and email and used to track your surfing -
&gt; and even tell whether you&#39;ve opened a particular
&gt; email.
