  <pre>here is Brian&#39;s last roundup for January

&gt; Dear All,
&gt; I went to the eastern Mara this weekend with Richard
&gt; and Ann Bishop, to
&gt; try and find Karamoja Apalis for them. Stopping at
&gt; the wooded luggas
&gt; along the Keekerok Road we found a group of
&gt; Grey-headed Woodpeckers,
&gt; these birds have been split in Sinclair and Ryan,
&gt; one of the criteria
&gt; being the absence of barring on the flight feathers,
&gt; however these birds
&gt; were as barred as normal Grey Woodpecker but they do
&gt; have extensive red
&gt; patches on the belly. There were a number of Little
&gt; Weavers in the
&gt; canopy, the males being in breeding plumage. We
&gt; easily located the
&gt; original pair of Karamoja Apalis on the track to
&gt; Naibor Shompole Camp.
&gt; On the plains we found a White-tailed Lark, the
&gt; first that I had seen
&gt; that far east in the Mara. The bird was very
&gt; blackish above, and showing
&gt; a prominent pale panel the length of the primaries
&gt; and well marked
&gt; facial pattern. At Naibor Albie Venter (the Manager)
&gt; took us on a walk
&gt; to a nearby permanent spring. There were some
&gt; Rufous-chested Swallows
&gt; coming in to roost, and a couple of Southern
&gt; Grosbeak Canarys. In the
&gt; camp there was a female Golden-winged Sunbird
&gt; feeding on the bushes.
&gt; The next morning (Sunday) we incredibly relocated
&gt; the White-tailed Lark
&gt; in the same place, and had some twenty Athi
&gt; Short-toed Larks. We
&gt; relocated the Karamoja Apalis so that Albie could
&gt; get some photos (and
&gt; he got some incredible shots), then looked at the
&gt; Buffy Pipits. This
&gt; is an area that needs some work, the literature
&gt; states that there are
&gt; two races of Plain-backed Pipit in Kenya, goodsoni
&gt; and zenkeri. In this
&gt; area the two are side by side. The goodsoni looks
&gt; like an Isabelline
&gt; Wheatear  with the same upright stance, exactly the
&gt; same colour and
&gt; pattern but with a longer tail and uniform rump. It
&gt; sits only on the
&gt; ground, never on bushes. When it walks the breast is
&gt; exaggeratedly
&gt; thrust forward. The Plain-backed Pipit is dark above
&gt; and quite dark
&gt; below, the actions are wagtail-like and the bird
&gt; walks with the body
&gt; held more horizontally. Readily perches on bushes. I
&gt; have long thought
&gt; of the goodsoni as more like the southern Buffy
&gt; Pipit, as that is just
&gt; what they look like. In the area we had over twenty
&gt; Taita Fiscals they
&gt; are very numerous here. As we had had such an easy
&gt; time finding the
&gt; original Karamojas for Albie to photograph we
&gt; decided to spend the rest
&gt; of the early morning searching the drepanolobium
&gt; along the main road,
&gt; and after an hour of this finally located a second
&gt; pair of Karamoja
&gt; Apalis feeding quietly, some five kilometres from
&gt; the original site.
&gt; Such a relief to learn that there is not just the
&gt; one pair in Kenya!
&gt; Also in this area there were some ten Pangani
&gt; Longclaws which were
&gt; displaying as if ready to breed.
&gt;  
&gt; Zimmermann &amp; Turner and Stevenson &amp; Fanshawe were
&gt; unaware of these
&gt; western  populations of Athi Short-toed Lark,
&gt; Pangani Longclaw, Taita
&gt; Fiscal and Southern Grosbeak Canary and considered
&gt; them only east of the
&gt; Rift in Southern Kenya, but the populations of all
&gt; four species is
&gt; considerable in this strange part of the Mara
&gt; ecosystem.
&gt;  
&gt; Other rather unusual sightings were a Cape Robin
&gt; Chat in a dry lugga
&gt; along the main Keekerok road back towards Narok, an
&gt; adult Eastern
&gt; Chanting Goshawk ten kilometres west of Narok, being
&gt; a surprise find,
&gt; but perhaps the strangest was a Lesser Flamingo
&gt; standing in a dampish
&gt; basin in the Kedong Valley.
&gt;  
&gt; Last Sunday (22nd) I went into Nairobi Park, still
&gt; plenty of Isabelline
&gt; and now an increase in Pieds, but little else away
&gt; from the dams. Athi
&gt; Dam now had increased to five Avocets, [a further
&gt; increase to 7 on 1st
&gt; Feb], and a new arrival was a very attractive adult
&gt; White Wagtail.
&gt; Otherwise there were fewer waders and six Shoveler.
&gt;  
&gt; More news from Steven Easleys trip.. a White
&gt; Wagtail and Black Duck at
&gt; Eldoret Airport Dam, 3 White Wagtails Nakuru Sewage
&gt; Ponds, juvenile
&gt; Spotted Eagle Nakuru,  a Fox Kestrel at the base of
&gt; the western cliffs
&gt; of Nakuru (where the six long stayers were a few
&gt; years ago),  a
&gt; Beaudouins Snake Eagle at Madende Creek and what
&gt; was probably the same
&gt; bird seen at Sio River the same day, 6 Black Herons
&gt; at Naivasha Club,
&gt; Little Ringed Plover and White Wagtail at Ol
&gt; Bolossat (Nyahururu), and
&gt; between  500 and 1000 Yellow-crowed Bishops at Mwea
&gt; Rice finally  a
&gt; Gambaga Flycatcher at Baringo Cliffs.
&gt;  
&gt; Best to all for now
&gt;  
&gt; Brian

I rather go birding...
