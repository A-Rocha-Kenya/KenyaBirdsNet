  <pre>this just came from Brian Finch

&gt; Dear All,
&gt; I spent Christmas in Tanzania, I was not on a bird
&gt; tour, but I think  some of the migrant records are
relevent to &gt; our own  region. 

&gt; On 24th December, there were Iranias scattered  in
open
&gt; situations in West Kilimanjaro and the lower parts
of Meru    &gt; immediately overlooking Amboseli. 
&gt; There was an Upchers Warbler at the entrance of
Lake Manyara
&gt; NP in the same group of acacias that there was one
&gt; in, in early January 2005.
&gt; At the far end of Lake Manyara NP there is an
incredible place &gt; called the Tree Lodge, sitting on
the balcony literally
&gt; pressed against the west wall of the Rift Valley, I
found that &gt; I was seeing species that in Kenya are
very strictly eastern. &gt; Silvery-cheeked Hornbills,
three Eastern Bearded Scrub-Robins &gt; sitting on the
same branch in some strange group display, both &gt;
Grey-Olive and Yellow-bellied Greenbuls and Peters
Twinspots &gt; singing from the scrubby bushes.
&gt; After returning to Kenya, I went up to Naivasha for
a couple  &gt; of days on 4th and 5th January, ostensibly
to photograph
&gt; Black-lored Babblers.
&gt; At 10-45 hrs I arrived at KWS Hippo Camp Site and
stayed until &gt; 18-30hrs.
&gt; The low level of the water, whilst rather alarming,
is proving &gt; a great attraction for the birds, and
there is a wide variety &gt; of thousands and thousands,
the whole lakeshore is teeming with
&gt; birdlife, and the habitat is extensive.
&gt; Huge numbers of White Pelicans, over a hundred
Greater        &gt; Flamingos, plenty of African
Spoonbills, Glossy Ibis, Grey     &gt; Herons but
surprisingly few egrets.
&gt; In the wader line most common species that one would
expect   &gt; are there, however only 2 Black-tailed
Godwits, 2 Spotted
&gt; Redshank but about 8 Temmincks Stints. There are
over 60     &gt; Avocets, but only 6 or so Common
Pratincoles. Large numbers of &gt; Little Stints and
Ruffs, slightly less Curlew Sandpipers and  &gt; Marsh
Sandpipers, then smaller numbers of Ringed Plovers,
Wood &gt; and Common Sandpipers and Greenshank.
&gt; Common Snipe are numerous, and feeding in the open
on the     &gt; foreshore.
&gt; Terns are in large numbers Whiskered probably
slightly more   &gt; numerous that White-winged Black and
Gull-billed. All gulls
&gt; were Grey-headed except for one very pale and large
Heuglins  &gt; Gull sitting on a hippos back. They seem
to be fairly regular &gt; at Naivasha nowadays. Whilst
walking across the tussocky      &gt; grassland I flushed
a dark, round-winged Snipe. Fortunately I &gt; managed to
photograph it sitting in the dry grass, and by     &gt;
persuing it very fortunately managed to get a flight  
       &gt; photograph, and it is what I suspected, an
African Snipe. This
&gt; is the first I have seen in the Rift. 
&gt; Several hundred Shoveler fed along the beach, but
only a very &gt; few Garganey and Pintail. Otherwise six
normal african ducks  &gt; were present.
&gt; Amongst the migrant raptors, it was quiet, very
strangely and &gt; sadly no Ospreys all day. Four
Harriers of three species, one
&gt; callidus Peregrine, and the strangest being a
second-year     &gt; Greater Spotted Eagle which fed in
the papyrus. It was        &gt; digitised both perched
and in flight.
&gt; Of the passerine migrants, there were six Red-tailed
Shrikes, &gt; and one adult male Red-backed Shrike, this
is a late date for &gt; a bird in the Rift Valley as they
should be on the wintering  &gt; grounds by now, mainly
in the south of the continent. Three    &gt; Northern,
two Isabelline Wheatears, one Rock Thrush, all three &gt;
migrant Swallows, a few Olivaceous and Willow Warblers
in the &gt; acacias. Plenty of Yellow Wagtails, apart
from one lutea, all
&gt; those seen that had some trace of male plumage
strangely      &gt; appeared to be beema, with washed out
pale grey crowns and    &gt; prominent white supercilii.
&gt; Somewhere in the late afternoon there was a Common
Quail      &gt; calling, but probably just a resident
bird.
&gt; I urge people to go up and see this spectacle, and
the wall to &gt; wall mammals that it is so nice to walk
amongst. It really is &gt; a very underated and
underwatched  KWS protected area.
&gt; Next morning I looked at Naivasha Club, there were a
hoardes  &gt; of birds around the island, an Osprey was a
welcome sight,
&gt; and there were two Common Teal at the jetty. A walk
out       &gt; towards the Yacht Club revealed many
Olivaceous Warblers in    &gt; the fever trees, and a
surprise find was an Upchers Warbler  &gt; in stunted
acacias keeping within a couple of feet of the     &gt;
ground. I obtained a few photos of it, but it kept
much to    &gt; cover. I have not seen the species at
Naivasha before, and it
&gt; is a very late date for a bird still moving south. 
&gt; I then looked at Naivasha Sopa, an amazing
establishment, I   &gt; had not been there since it was
Safariland. The Pearl-spotted
&gt; Owlets are still in residence, making it easier to
see what   &gt; small birds are in the acacias.
&gt; There was an immature Lesser Black-backed Gull on a
hippo, and &gt; a Swamphen in the water meadows run off
from Homegrown.       &gt; Neither of the two localities
had Black-tailed Godwit or      &gt; Spotted Redshank,
which was a surprise.
&gt; The conditions at Lake Naivasha are ripe for turning
up       &gt; something very unexpected.
&gt; Best birding to all throughout 2006, and a very
happy new year,
&gt; Brian


I rather go birding...
