<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>To take full advantage of the last few days of 
Birdwatch, myself and Kelvin Mazera decided to do another&nbsp;list at Nguuni 
Wildlife Sanctuary on a dry day in contrast to the previously very wet 
day.&nbsp; We had thought to improve on the numbers but in fact we only improved 
by&nbsp;4. &nbsp;The interesting thing is that many of the birds seen on the wet 
day were not seen on the dry day and vice versa. The "forest" area was now not 
under water and there were plenty of dudus for the birds to feed on.&nbsp; At 
one point we had Eastern Bearded Scrub Robin, White Browed Robin Chat, White 
Browed Scrub Robin and Bare Eyed Thrush within a few feet of each other.&nbsp; 
Black Throated Wattle Eyes were numerous. Overall a sad lack of migrants.&nbsp; 
Numerous Spotted Flycatchers, Barn Swallows.&nbsp; Five Common Sandpipers. Black 
Breasted Snake Eagle, one magnificent Sooty Falcon ( a lifer for Kelvin) dashed 
in trying to catch Red Billed Fire Finches and a very noisy Isabelline (Red 
Tailed) Shrike while we were eating lunch.&nbsp; Olivaceous Warbler in the usual 
Acacia, very hard to see but we did finally manage.&nbsp; Yellow Wagtails seem 
to be finally arriving, 2 on the ground and a big flock flying in as we left 
and&nbsp;a sole Eurasian Golden Oriole sums up the visitors. White Throated 
Bee-Eaters were&nbsp;being very elusive but flew in large numbers into the 
picnic site where they had a massive feast on some kind of airborn dudu. Such a 
magnificent sight. Another exciting bird was African Cuckoo Hawk (another lifer 
for Kelvin) flying over in full view.&nbsp; I have only seen this once before in 
this area.&nbsp; Pangani's Longclaw (strangely none of the&nbsp;more common 
Yellow Throated) and Black Headed Batis&nbsp;rounded off the more interesting 
species.&nbsp; A total of 76 species, about 20 down on what I would 
expect.&nbsp; Very few water birds at the ponds. Water lilies are being eaten by 
the Water Bucks, wading areas are overgrown&nbsp;and I wonder how long the 
acacias will stand up to 9 Giraffes feeding off them?&nbsp; This area, once a 
fantastic birding&nbsp;spot is definitely on the decline, such a pity. Ah well 
c'est la vie. A great Birdwatch, hope everybody enjoyed it as much as we did
