&gt; On Monday 2 January I found two Chiffchaffs in

&gt; lowest forest edge at ca 2300m on the south side of
&gt; Mt. Meru.
&gt; 
&gt; Yesterday (4th) there were at least six birds in
&gt; another area some three km
&gt; from the first and a couple of hundred metres
&gt; higher. All those seen clearly
&gt; appeared to be Phylloscopus collybita abietinus and
&gt; most were in repeated
&gt; song for short periods as they foraged.
&gt; 
&gt; All were feeding chiefly in the canopy and sometimes
&gt; in the mid strata of
&gt; those well-established juniper plantations
&gt; (Juniperus procera ?)that have a
&gt; dense herbaceous ground flora. A moderately
&gt; bird-rich &#39;artificial&#39; habitat
&gt; here on Meru which , as one would expect nowadays,
&gt; is being felled and
&gt; converted to potatoes and maize at a very much
&gt; faster rate than it is being
&gt; (re) planted.

I rather go birding...
