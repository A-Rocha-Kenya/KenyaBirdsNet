  <pre>Greetings,

I recently caught &amp; ringed 2 Red-capped Robin-chats in the forest below 
Kijabe. I saw one last year at the same place in October. Does anyone know 
if perhaps they stay in the Kikuyu Escarpment forests year-round??

Also, around 5:15-5:30 pm I saw for the first time quite a large gathering 
of Hartlaub&#39;s Turacos. I lost count after seeing at least 20 and they were 
all moving up the forest, presumably to roost together? It was kind of like 
&#34;follow the leader&#34;, where the birds flew from tree to tree, one after 
another. If this is normal for this species then I was just not aware as 
I&#39;ve only seen 3-4 together at one time.

Jeff Davis
