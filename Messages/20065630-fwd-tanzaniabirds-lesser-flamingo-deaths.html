Subject: [tanzaniabirds] Lesser flamingo deaths

          I was at Lake Nakuru today and noticed a great number of dead Lesser Flamingos, adult and immature. Our safari drivers too were surprised at the numbers. At the point where we accessed the lake shore I would estimate, per linear metre of lakeshore, not less than one corpse on shore and another in the water, for as far as I could see to either side. Marabous and other scavengers were eating them as fast as they could, but were much too few for the available supply.  Is this an ongoing longterm situation or something new? Thought it might be worth mentioning even if not geographically TZ.
