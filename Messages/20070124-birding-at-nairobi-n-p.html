  <div>Hello Birders,</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>What a way to start a good year by seen a rare bird at Nairobi N.P. The month of January is the African Waterfowls counts. On Wed 24th, we went to Nairobi N.P for the counts, a small group was send to Hippo pool and other wetlands towards Athi Basin. At hippo pool, we saw an adult White-backed Night Heron which was a lifer to all of those in the group. For me, it was not a lifer as i saw one&nbsp;with ital and Bernd some&nbsp;years ago.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Shailesh</div><p>&#32;
