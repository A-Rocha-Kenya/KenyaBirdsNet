<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>First bird seen a nightjar, followed around until 
we were pretty certain it was a Square Tailed or Gabon night jar. This took 
about half the total bird watching time!&nbsp; Migrants were the best they have 
been so far. A female Common Rock Thrush in a tree! Often wonder why it is 
called "rock" as when in Msa it is invariably on a tree or a fence. Plenty of 
Barn Swallows, a lone Common Sandpiper, Several Spotted Flycatchers, one 
Isabelline or Red Tailed Shrike, and in the dusk hundreds of Yellow Wagtails 
flying into the shale quarry to roost. One settled on the grass near us and 
seemed pretty exhausted so maybe they are just flying in. We certainly haven't 
seen them except the odd one, so far this season. Other birds of interest Batis 
Minor, a superb pair of Black Shouldered Kites and a Black Breasted Snake 
Eagle.&nbsp; Carry on Birding. Feel welcome to join us in Mombasa any 3rd Sat in 
the month. Phone Marlene Reid on 0720 949 195 (Marlene Reid,
