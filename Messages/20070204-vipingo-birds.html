<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Always keen to see a new spot I accepted an 
invitation to the new golf complex being developed at Vipingo, getting the 
invitation extended to include Kevin Mazera.&nbsp; This is on the left hand side 
of the road coming from Mombasa to Malindi and covers some 2,800 acres.&nbsp; 
The development looks very impressive but not being a golfer.....Anyway as a 
birding area it proved very interesting.&nbsp; The first lovely sighting was a 
group of Senegal Plovers followed by&nbsp;our first Northern Wheatear 
(m)&nbsp;of the season. There is a big dam, but only a sole African Jacana on 
the water.&nbsp;However the surrounding trees were full of Eurasian Golden 
Orioles, the first large group we have seen this season. Barn Swallows plenty. 
Indigenous species of note Black Throated Wattle Eyes, Whalberg's Eagle. Lizard 
Buzzard, Striped Kingfisher which seems rather rare these days and about 25 
other more common species.&nbsp; As we didn't do any prolonged or intensive 
birding this promises to yield many more species on more focused visits.&nbsp;
