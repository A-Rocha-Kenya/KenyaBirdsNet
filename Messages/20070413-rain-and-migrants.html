Rain finally fell in Nairobi on Tuesday night, and brought with it some northern migrants. Nature Kenya&#8217;s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk decided to go to Splash where there was some shelter, and participants huddled in the entrance for a while as it rained. Their patience was rewarded with a Great Reed Warbler making its way across the leafy fence.<BR>
<BR>
Other migrants seen during the morning included Barn Swallow, Common Whitethroat, Willow Warbler and Red-backed Shrike.<BR>

Wishing you good birding, Fleur</SPAN></FONT>
