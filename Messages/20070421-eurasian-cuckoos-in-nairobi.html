Eurasian Cuckoos have been on the move through Nairobi and environs in the past week.<BR>
<BR>
On Sunday 15 April, Nature Kenya&#8217;s Sunday Birdwatch saw several Eurasian Cuckoos along the road to Kusyombunguo Guest House past Lukenya Hill. At the Guest House there was also a small flock of Common House Martins with other swallows. <BR>
<BR>
A Eurasian Cuckoo was also seen flying over the dam at Jamhuri Park on the Wednesday Morning Birdwalk on April 18. Other reports came from Langata and Gigiri.<BR>
<BR>
Wishing you good birding,<BR>
<BR>
