<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dear All,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Further to Fleur's report on Eurasian 
cuckoos.&nbsp; We saw one on the bird walk yesterday (Sat 21st) at Jumba 
Ruins.&nbsp; Very exciting for the Msa bird walk as we have never before had one 
on our list.&nbsp; Pity was that it was only seen by myself and John Abundo when 
we were returning to the rest of the group after fixing a fellow birder's car 
(John being our birding mechanic). Fortunately the others did get a brief 
glimpse as were left when it flew across our path, perched briefly before 
disappearing into the trees. Not many birds around at Jumba, one Olivaceous 
Warbler, three Grey Plovers and a beautiful Brown Breasted Barbet. Silvery 
Cheeked Hornbills flying overhead.&nbsp; Plenty of Olive Sunbirds and a few 
other local common birds.&nbsp; Such a beautiful place!</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Eurasian Golden Orioles on Tudor Creek now down to 
one or two but 2 weeks ago they were in dozens. Starlings Violet Backed and 
Black Bellied have also been around in flocks and my Wood Owl still serenades 
(if one can call it that) every evening. He even lets me talk to him over the 
verandah without flying off. The neighbours think I am mad . . . . Happy birding
