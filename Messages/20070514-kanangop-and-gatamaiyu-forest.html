  <pre>dear all

a week past Sunday, the 6 th May, four of us spent the day at those 2
places . Colin Mcintosh , a world wide birder based in Paris , Alex
Duncanson [kcc golfing fame !]  Joseph Kariuki and I had a very
enjoyable day up there , but it was slightly wet.

Kanangop grasslands yielded 4 Sharpe&#39;s Longclaw and some good , close
views  of a Capped Wheatear and Red-capped Lark .

Our main focus was the forest which is a great  place if you have never
been .It must be my fourth time and I am always delighted to be there .
Despite being a bit wet , it still produced nearly 50 species , amongst
which a male and female Bar-tailed Trogon were very visible . Other less
common species were an Eastern Bronze-naped Pigeon ,Brown -chested
Alethe ,Black-throated Apalis , Abyssinian Crimsonwing and the most
colourful Black-fronted Bush-shrike.


good birding

Mike D
