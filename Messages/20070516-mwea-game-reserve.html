  <pre>Dear All,

This Sunday I went with Mike Davidson and Fleur Ng&#39;Weno to Mwea Game Reserve.
We left Nairobi Museum and 7:45 am, and left via Thika.
Travelling down the Thika Road towards Mwingi, we had a Lizard Buzzard on the telephone wires at 50km from the Thika Road Junction, and the next stop was at 70km. Here we birded for about an hour in dense scrub, with open ground with scattered trees and small seasonal swamps. There were a few interesting observations, the oddest being an adult Black-capped Social Weaver in a colony of Grey-headed Social Weaver. The Grey-headeds never showed any aggression to the Black-headed, which was sitting around their nests with grass in its bill. Unfortunately we did not have time to stay with the bird to see if it had its own nest or a mate, but this record is way west of the normal distribution for the species. There were two other birds that were farther west than expected, Fischer&#39;s Starlings were fairly common, and there were also Brown-tailed Apalis. Other nice birds included Bare-eyed Thrush, Tiny Cisticola, four extravert African Penduline-Tits, Grey-headed Silverbill,
 Straw-tailed Whydahs and Southern Grosbeak Canarys.</pre>
