<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Greetings from Mombasa to all our fellow 
birders,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>It is a long time since our birdwalk went to Nguuni 
animal sanctuary, mostly because we have to pay shs 200 each to get in! Kevin 
Mazera is working there just now so rather than miss him on the walk we decided 
to join him. First bird at the gate was a Green Backed Heron. There used to be 
lots of water birds in this park but they are now very scarce, only one other 
Black Headed Heron seen. On the drive up to the picnic area there were several 
Pale Flycatchers and a large flock of Violet Backed Starlings. A Sulpher 
Breasted Bushshrike calling but not seen. A walk round a couple of the ponds 
which unfortunately are now devoid of water birds except for Water Dikkops which 
are fairly numerous, turned up Yellow Throated Longclaw, Palm Nut Vulture, 
Zanzibar Red Bishops, Common Waxbills collecting nesting material, Bare Eyed 
Thrush, a gathering of Long Tailed Fiscal Shrikes all waving their tails in the 
air, Black Headed Batis, two Paradise Flycatchers, probably a male without his 
long tail and a female and in the gloaming just as we were leaving a Mangrove 
Kingfisher.&nbsp; Quite a few more common species were seen. The magic was 
driving out in the dark and seeing Slender Tailed Nightjar sitting on the path 
swooping up and resettling in front of the car. Then a very small Nightjar 
appeared, sitting in front of us. It was too small to be a Donaldson Smiths and 
on closer inspection it was seen to be a more or less fully fledged juvenile 
nightjar, allover dark brown and slightly fluffy. The parent bird then flew down 
and started to feed it presumably with a dudu. This was such a magic moment. 
None of us had ever seen this before. The young bird seemed oblivious of our 
presence and we had to wait a fairly long time until it flew off to the side so 
that we could creep past. Ending a bird walk on a high note is always good. Join 
us for birding in Msa anytime you are around. Marlene Reid

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>A trip to Jumba La Mtwana beach following Sat - a 
fairly big flock of Common Terns mixed with one or two Lesser Crested. Pure 
delight to sit and watch these very swift and agile terns dipping and diving in 
the sea at high tide.&nbsp; No waders on the beach but an 
unidentified&nbsp;flock of small waders was seen passing in the distance.
