  <pre>Dear All,

Just back from a couple of weeks guiding in the West and Highlands. The trip
was successful overall, but the unseasonal weather caused several afternoons
to be missed. Most birds were very quiet, although the Weavers, Widows and
Bishops were still in breeding dress. Missing species included some normally
commonly seen species, such as Goliath and Purple Herons, Spur-winged Goose,
Comb Duck, and even Kori Bustanrd was absent from Samburu, and only one was
seen in Nairobi.

We started in the Mara, where it was exceptionally wet. The usual species
were seen in the reserve itself, and the escarpment was fairly quiet, with
highlights including Trilling and Rock-loving Cisticolas and Pale
Wren-warbler. We also spent quite a while on a pair of Seedeaters there,
which later research shows to be Stripe-breasted. The various field-guides
we had didn&#39;t give confidence, but BoA more-or-less has it to a T. A new
bird for me anyway! Schalow&#39;s Turacos were calling, but in the distance, so
we couldn&#39;t connect.

We headed north to Kisumu via Lolgorien and Kilgoris, with not much,
although a Double-toothed Barbet about 15km south of Kilgoris was new for me
in that area. The rain prevented anything on arrival at Ahero and Dunga, but
it was good to settle into the very comfortable tents at Kiboko Bay Lodge,
in an excellent location for birding Dunga.

The following morning we found Papyrus Canary and Lesser Moorhen in the
swamps, but couldn&#39;t tempt out Papyrus Gonolek (one of the client&#39;s target
species). However, there were several Little Bitterns there. Heading north,
we stopped at the Nzoia River Bridge on the Kisumu-Busia Road, and had 12
Rock Pratincoles. I have seen a few here before, and there were barely any
rocks here (or at Mumias) which were clear of the very high water, so this
group were all gathered together. We then headed to Sioport, down the very
new and fast road from Bumala - Nangina, which goes as far as the dam (which
had very little on it). The good road itself does continue (presumably to
Siaya), so could prove an excellent way of getting to this region, Black and
Black-winged Bishops were displaying, and Steel-blue Whydahs were fairly
common. Black-bellied Firefinches were also very visible. Once at Sioport,
we went to the rivermouth, and had several very confiding Papyrus Gonoleks,
as well as a Blue-breasted Bee-eater feeding a youngster (may be a Kenya
breeding record, but they could have bred just across the river!). Northern
Brown-throated Weavers were also nesting there. The roadbuilders have made a
swathe through the papyrus here, and this gives good access to the habitat
(and for the fishermen!). We couldn&#39;t tempt any other specials out, but it
was the middle of the day and we had restricted time.

We tried along the Sio River for White-winged Warbler, but couldn&#39;t get a
squeak, and then went to Mungatsi, where it was also extremely quiet. At
Kakamega, we got most of the specials with a lot of hard work, as it was
similarly quiet, but at least it didn&#39;t rain!

Next up was around Kitale, and we started at Saiwa, where it hacked it down
with rain. We managed to get a little birding in before dusk, but nothing
special. The following morning, we headed to Kongolei, where White-crested
Turaco and Yellow-billed Shrike were both located. The scrub around the Suam
River was alive with birds, including a couple of mystery warblers which I
am still scratching my head about.

We crossed the Kerio Valley with further rain, causing waterfalls across the
rocks. Once at Baringo, we had a hary river crossing where the road had
washed away. It rained heavily all night, and in the morning it was
extremely wet underfoot. We still managed the cliff walks, and found Greyish
Eagle Owl roosting, as well as Slender-tailed Nightjar. Heuglin&#39;s Coursers
had decamped to somewhere overnight, but we saw the rest of the specials. A
couple of Chestnut Weavers at the bird table was something which I hadn&#39;t
seen there before.

Down to Nakuru, where afternoon rain again caused birding to be slow. A
singing Rosy-throated Longclaw was a surprise, as I had never seen it in
Nakuru before. Next up was a trip through North Kinangop to the Aberdares.
Sharpe&#39;s Longclaws were common near North Kinangop, although we didn&#39;t see
any Wing-snapping Cisticolas there, and Jackson&#39;s Widowbirds were busy
displaying. Jackson&#39;s Francolins were everywhere on the way up through the
bamboo. At the Mutubio gate, we found Aberdare Cisticola with reasonable
ease, and had a pleasant drive across the very sunny moorlands, although
there weren&#39;t many birds. One nice surpise on the Treetops Salient was a
Giant Forest Hog crossing the road.

At Naro Moru, it was again fairly quiet, although the resident Little Rock
Thrushes seemed to be enjoying the scrub coming up around the golf course. A
Giant Kingfisher appeared to be nesting along the river. We went along the
Solio Road, and were pleasantly surprised to find they have been improving
it, creating drainage channels for the water to run off, and making it
useable again (for how long....). A Greater Kestrel was on the posts here,
but it was surprising to find just a single Capped Wheatear.

North to Samburu, things were quiet still, with no Golden Pipits, no Somali
Coursers, Buntings or Bee-eaters. In Shaba, we found William&#39;s Lark after a
lot of searching, and they were quiet too, but there was no sign of
Friedmann&#39;s. The Lanner pair Brian reported have obviously worked out that
birders flush Harlequin Quails, as they were hunting again in the same way!
A single Somali Fiscal and a Northern Grosbeak Canary were also on the lava
fields.

Heading back south, the Grass Owls were absent, and Wajee gave up 3 Hinde&#39;s
Babblers, as well as a surprise Eastern Green-backed Honeybird in the trees
around reception. At Castle Forest Lodge, we heard Green Ibis at dusk, and
managed to find them in the morning, as three stopped in a tree on their way
down. Fog hampered efforts soon after dawn, and we headed south to Thika.
Blue Posts was very quiet, although there were half-a-dozen Grey-olive
Greenbuls along the riverside.

Next we headed across Kieni, but fog put paid to much birding there, and we
headed to the Kinangop Flyover paddocks. It was virtually silent there, and
we found no Wing-snapping Cisticolas, nor any Sharpe&#39;s Longclaws, despite
Brian having had many just a few weeks previously. The Pond at Limuru had
White-backed Ducks with 5 young chicks (presumably a different brood to
Brian&#39;s earlier in the year), and the Coots there were breeding
prodigiously.

At Whistling Thorns, we had a probable Nairobi Pipit in nearby Acacia
woodland (pictures were taken for comparison), and the Magadi Road has 2
Bush Pipits at the Icross Junction, as well as singing Banded Parisomas, and
several Grey-headed Silverbills. At Camel Road, Tiny Cisticolas were noisy,
and Paradise Whydahs were coming into breeding dress (again????). In the
park in the afternoon, it was difficult birding with the long grass, but we
found Nairobi Pipit in the woods, and Red-throated Tit in a mixed flock at
Hippo Pools.

All in all, it was an interesting visit, with bizarre weather.

All the best

Nigel
