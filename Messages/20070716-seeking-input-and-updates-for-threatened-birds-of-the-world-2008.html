  <pre>BirdLife International seeking input and updates for Threatened birds
of the world 2008.

As Red List Authority for birds on the IUCN Red List, BirdLife
re-evaluates the status of all the world&#39;s birds every four years. The
landmark publication Threatened birds of the world, published in 2000,
was followed by Threatened birds of the world 2004 which was released
as a CD-ROM. We are now embarking on a re-evaluation for 2008, and
plan to release another CD-ROM, in addition to continuing to make all
the species factsheets and data available through the BirdLife website
(see http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/index.html ). 

It is important to keep this information up-to-date, and ensure that
our evaluation of the extinction risk to each species is based on the
best and most up-to-date information. This helps BirdLife and other
organisations and governments to set priorities for conservation
action, including identifying and conserving Important Bird Areas.

Proposals to revise the Red List category for a number of species are
under discussion on BirdLife&#39;s web-based discussion forums (see
www.birdlifeforums.org), where comments and relevant information can
be contributed. They are designed to make the Red Listing process as
transparent and open-access as possible. Please visit the site to see
which species are actively under review, contribute any relevant
information or comments, and suggest other species that may require
revision to their classification. This is your chance to influence the
global conservation ranking for the world&#39;s birds. 

We will be sending out factsheet profiles for each threatened species
to experts for review, but would welcome any comments, news from the
field and updates from anyone, particularly new information relating
to population size and trends, threats, and conservation actions
underway and needed. Search for any species, family, region or country
at http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/index.html to view the
current information we hold. All contributions used to update
factsheets will be explicitly acknowledged.

To be incorporated into Threatened birds of the world 2008, we need to
receive any comments and new information on threatened species by 1
October 2007.

BirdLife relies on contributions and input from thousands of
individuals and organisations around the world, both within and beyond
the BirdLife Partnership, to ensure that our conservation priority
setting is based on the best scientific information. We are extremely
grateful for all information received. 

Please send any updates to science@birdlife.org
