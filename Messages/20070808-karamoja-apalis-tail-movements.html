  <div>Hi Andy</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>The first time I got Karamoja in the Serengeti it was in a mixed stand of drepanolobium and another Acacia (can't remember which!). The exaggerated tail movements were almost the most noticeable feature. There were two birds, so perhaps it is seasonal, related to courtship and therefore not noticed by all observers?</div>  <div>Regards</div>  <div>Alastair Kilpin<BR><BR>&nbsp;<SPAN style="COLOR: white">._,___</SPAN> <!--End group email --></div><BR><p>&#32;
