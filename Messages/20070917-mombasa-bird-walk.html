<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dear Birders,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>A quiet time for birds at the Nguu Tatu area.&nbsp; 
Migrants still not around although there were quite a few waders at Tiwi last 
week when I was there.&nbsp; Lots of Red-Billed Quelea and lots of Superb 
Starlings amongst which there was&nbsp;a solitary Red-Billed Buffalo Weaver. My 
friend in Likoni also said she had the weavers in her garden. We rarely see them 
this far down. Nothing much else of note.&nbsp; Two splendid Pal Nut Vultures, 
one juvenile on the dam and an adult flying over at sunset.&nbsp; Nice to see 
that the White Faced tree Ducks are back although not in large numbers.&nbsp; 
Join us if you are in Mombasa on the 3rd Sat. of the month. (Marlene 
Reid)</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>P.S. Lots of Madagascar Bee-Eaters flying over 
Tudor Creek on several early mornings last week. Only saw 
adults.</FONT></DIV></BODY></HTML>
