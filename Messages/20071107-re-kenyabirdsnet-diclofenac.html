  <pre>Dear Munir et al
Just a quick suggestion about &#34;diclofenac&#34;
Could WCST, Birdlife, Peregrine Fund put up a petition form that could be signed
via email or something.

&gt; Vulture-killing drug licensed in Tanzania
&gt; 07-11-2007
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Investigations by WCST (WildLife Conservation Society of Tanzania, Birdlife
&gt; in Tanzania), have confirmed that Diclofenac has been licensed for veterinary
&gt; use in the country.
&gt; 
&gt; Diclofenac induces fatal illness in vultures of the Gyps genus. Its use to
&gt; treat livestock in the Indian subcontinent has driven three Gyps species to
&gt; the brink of extinction. 
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;This is shocking news, and means that the threat is far greater than we
&gt; thought&#34; -Paul Nnyiti , WCST 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; An official from Tanzania&#39;s Ministry of Livestock told Paul Nnyiti of WCST
&gt; that Diclofenac is licensed and stocked in veterinary centres, and available
&gt; under prescription by qualified veterinary personnel. 
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;This is shocking news, and means that the threat is far greater than we
&gt; thought,&#34; said Paul Nnyiti of WCST. &#34;We now fear that Diclofenac may also
&gt; already be licensed and used in other African countries. BirdLife Partners
&gt; must work quickly to alert governments and veterinary organisations to the
&gt; dangers of the drug, and campaign for licenses to be revoked and Diclofenac
&gt; to be withdrawn from sale throught the African continent.&#34;
