A short afternoon drive in Nairobi National Park found a dark phase Booted Eagle circling over the Ivory Burning site, showing the white shoulder &#8220;landing lights&#8221;; and a tiny Whinchat near a very large rhinoceros.<BR>
<BR>
Pair of Brown-backed Woodpecker and male and female Black Cuckoo-shrike in the park forest. It seems to me that in the past Black Cuckoo-shrikes were mainly seen from June to October. Are they becoming more common year-round?<BR>

Wishing you happy holidays, Fleur</SPAN></FONT>
