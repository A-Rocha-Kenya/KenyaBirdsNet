<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Having had a productive walk in the shale quarry, 
at the southern end of Nguu Tatu in August we decided to revisit.&nbsp; The 
recently planted trees are growing up fast but are mostly eucalyptus and pine 
(to be used for bio-gas) so don't seem to attract many birds. Before we started 
on the walk we went to see the young Verreaux Eagle Owl which had fallen from 
the nest, couldn't fly and was being harassed and attacked by Indian House Crows 
in the Nguuni Sanctuary.&nbsp; Despite it necessarily being caged it was 
probably the hi-light of the walk, just so fluffy and cute, blinking its bright 
pink eyelids at everyone, it was hard to persuade the birders to leave it 
alone.&nbsp;First pond was fairly quiet, not even much weaver presence, just a 
few Golden Palm and Grosbeaks. A lone African Black Crake, no sign of 
the&nbsp;Allen's Gallinule.&nbsp; The star of the pond being a Purple Heron 
hunkered down in a central patch of reeds obviously under the impression that 
he/she was invisible but affording us a superb view. Migrants not in great 
numbers, one immature Red Tailed Shrike, several Spotted Flycatchers, Barn 
Swallows flyiing over,&nbsp;circling and dropping into&nbsp;their roost inside 
Nguuni later in the walk. Three Common Sandpipers at the second pond with a lone 
Greenshank. Crested Francolins on the pathway, 2 Woollyneck Storks flying over 
the quarry, their favourite place. One Little Egret. At the end of the walk, 
before another quick goodbye visit to the owl, now stomping round the floor of 
the cage looking for the dead mice he gets for supper, there were Northern 
Brownbuls in the hedge&nbsp;and a Slender Tailed Nightjar calling.&nbsp; Last 
bird walk for 2007. Wishing you all happy and enjoyable birding for 2008.
