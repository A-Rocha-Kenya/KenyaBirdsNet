<P>CALL FOR ACTION<BR><BR>CLIMATE CHANGE, BIODIVERSITY AND 
TOURISM<BR><BR>EQUATIONS Statement on International Biodiversity Day, 22nd May 
2007<BR><BR>Global climate change is probably the most severe environmental 
threat in<BR>the 21st century. Alarm bells have started to ring worldwide for 
many<BR>important aspects of life like access to water, food production, 
health,<BR>extreme weather conditions and abrupt and irreversible 
environmental<BR>changes. <BR><BR>In 2003, the UN World Tourism Organisation 
(UNWTO) held its first Summit on<BR>Climate Change and Tourism in Djerba, 
Tunisia, which set a proactive call<BR>for response from different sectors such 
as national governments, tourism<BR>companies, academic institutions, NGOs and 
private and public sectors in the<BR>form of the Djerba Declaration. It 
recognised the complex relationship<BR>between tourism and climate change, the 
existing and rapidly worsening<BR>impact of climate change on tourism 
development in sensitive ecosystems and<BR>also the contribution of tourism 
industry to climate change. Today climate<BR>change is a top issue for 
policymakers around the world and tourism is<BR>becoming an important element of 
the discussions. This is because climate<BR>represents a key resource for 
tourism and climate related risks in the form<BR>of changing weather patterns 
and extreme conditions can have a serious<BR>impact on travel patterns. 
<BR><BR>On the other hand the tourism industry itself is a contributor to 
climate<BR>change by generating greenhouse gas emissions through 
travellers'<BR>consumption of transport services, notably road and air 
transport, and high<BR>levels of energy consumption like air conditioning, 
heating and lighting in<BR>tourism establishments. The aviation industry is the 
biggest threat as it is<BR>the fastest growing source of greenhouse gases, 
growing at a rate of 5% per<BR>year and contributing to 3% of global emissions. 
Air travel, particularly<BR>long haul international flights emitting greenhouse 
gases at high cruising<BR>altitudes, adds substantially to climate change 
effects. <BR><BR>The earth's biodiversity has also not been spared. There is a 
two way<BR>relationship between biodiversity and climate: biodiversity is 
threatened by<BR>human-induced climate change and climate change is already 
forcing<BR>biodiversity to adapt either through shifting habitat or changing 
life<BR>cycles.<BR><BR>The relentless expansion of the tourism industry is a 
major cause for<BR>concern. Tourism continues to pervade coasts and islands, 
especially in the<BR>developing nations leading to undesirable impacts on 
ecosystems and<BR>biodiversity. Even Multilateral Environmental Agreements like 
the Convention<BR>on Biological Diversity also continue to promote tourism as a 
market based<BR>conservation scheme in coastal and island ecosystems without 
application of<BR>the precautionary principle, as suggested by the Indigenous 
Peoples' Caucus<BR>in the Eight Conference of Parties to the Convention. 
<BR><BR>Communities that live on coastal areas and small island states face 
serious<BR>risks due to sea level rise. They face the brunt of displacement 
through<BR>expansion of tourism facilities and establishments on the one hand. 
On the<BR>other, their livelihoods such as fishing are affected due to the fact 
that<BR>ecosystems like coral reefs that support fish populations are dying as 
a<BR>result of climate change impacts. In mountainous regions melting of 
glaciers<BR>pose the risk of floods and threatens the lives and livelihoods 
of<BR>communities which are dependent on agriculture. Forest diversity is 
also<BR>threatened by climate change which in turn threatens the livelihood 
of<BR>forest dependent communities. A significant stretch of the 
Mediterranean<BR>coast faces desertification due to decrease in rain and rise in 
temperatures<BR>over long periods of time, posing a threat to tourism and thus 
impacting<BR>local communities reliant on tourism.<BR><BR>EQUATIONS calls upon 
governments to take serious and urgent steps for the<BR>implementation of 
conventions, protocols and resolutions related to climate<BR>change. We urge 
them to take cognisance of the tourism and linked<BR>transportation and aviation 
industries as a significant factors contributing<BR>to climate change, and 
therefore to formulate international and domestic<BR>environmental and tourism 
policies and regulatory mechanisms, to adapt and<BR>mitigate climate change 
impacts. <BR><BR>The tourism industry is notorious for high per capita 
consumption of water,<BR>poor energy efficiency, waste management issues and 
serious negative<BR>environmental impacts. We call upon the tourism industry to 
take on the<BR>challenge of an authentic response to the climate change crisis 
by<BR>implementing measures to reduce energy consumption in tourism 
establishments<BR>by employing energy-efficient and appropriate green 
technologies. We<BR>recognise that this may require a significant transformation 
of current<BR>forms of mass tourism and we urge a serious engagement on this 
issue to<BR>reduce tourism's climate change footprint. <BR><BR>We question 
corporations and international financial institutions like the<BR>World Bank who 
promote market based measures such as carbon trading and<BR>carbon sinks which 
we believe are unsustainable and false measures. We seek<BR>a complete halt to 
financing fossil fuel exploration and demand serious<BR>investment in 
alternative sustainable energy options. Along with peoples<BR>movements all over 
the world, we condemn the rush into biofuels and carbon<BR>sinks as these lead 
to destruction of forests, increase monoculture,<BR>promote large agribusiness 
and pose serious threats to subsistence<BR>agriculture and food security 
<BR><BR>We call for climate justice and the need to recognise that the single 
minded<BR>pursuance of unsustainable growth strategies puts our common future 
at<BR>peril. <BR><BR>The responsibility of seeking viable and sustainable 
solutions to avert the<BR>climate crisis must take into account particularly the 
plight of the most<BR>vulnerable communities around the world.<BR><BR>EQUATIONS
