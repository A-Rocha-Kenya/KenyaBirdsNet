<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>Dear all,</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>It has been long (a year in fact) since I had a chance of birding down the <?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /><st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Magadi Road</st1:address></st1:Street>. Today I took the opportunity and together with Brian and Tal we drove down to see what can we find.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>Over all it is very dry all over the place and even at Ol-tepesi there is no water as the pipe have been broken and the place is deserted.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>Very few birds all the way down and the habitat seems to be vanishing in a hazardous speed to charcoal burnings. At the first bridge where we were used to see so many birds it seems that there is no more trees left to support birds. What is left, is already being hammered.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>After the disappointment at Ol-tepesi we decided to continue down the <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Eremit Rd.</st1:address></st1:Street> to try and find some of the birds that Brian reported before from this area.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>All the way to Eremit is was still very dry and other than the few Singing Bush Larks, there was not much to stop for. At one point where we stopped, Brian found a nice male Yellow-throated Plated Lizard in full breeding colours that brought some interest to this dull morning.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>When arriving to the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Eremit</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Valley</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, we found some water and also some birds at last. </SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>It was not long till we saw the first interesting bird; a White-headed Barbet of the subspecies <I>leucocephalus</I> which is usually found only in Ruma NP, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Mt.</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Elgon</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> and Kongelai Escarpment. What does it do so far to the east is still a mystery to be solved…</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>Further down the stream a Bearded Woodpecker (which is a nice bird wherever you find one) and a group of Arrow-marked Babblers that the nearest record should be <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Lake</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Naivasha</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>. Also around was a pair of <st1:place w:st="on">Northern Brownbuls</st1:place> that are more related to Tsavo, Amboseli and Samburu usually than the southern Rift Valley.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>On the migrants’ front, not much was seen during the all day, but few Willow Warblers, at least 2-3 Upcher’s Warblers and few more Spotted Flycatchers. Not a single migrant raptor and only 2 raptors all together. On the way back a breeding male Steel-blue Whydah was also passing by.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>Surprises are still awaiting to be found down the southern parts of the Rift Valley and so close to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Nairobi</st1:place></st1:City>, but with the current decrease in habitat it is probably a very tight race what will come first?!</SPAN></P>
