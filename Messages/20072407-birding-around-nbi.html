<P>Hi All,</P>
<P>In the beginning of August I had friends out from UK for four days, and went birding with them, though all fairly casual. On 3<SUP>rd</SUP> we went to Gatamaiyu. Much as expected, additionally a pair of Cuckoo-Hawks at the gate perched extravertly on overhead wires, five Bar-tailed Trogons together with males battling it out for the attention of females, another two further along the track. On 4<SUP>th</SUP> late morning to early afternoon a short way down the Magadi Road, just at the Icross Junction nine Short-tailed Larks and a pair of noisy Bush Pipits. A male (Ngong) Pringle's Puffback in a mixed feeding party in scrub on the Ngong side of Kisamese at well over 6000 ft asl. This is the highest I have ever found the species. On 5<SUP>th</SUP> during a game count in NNP, two Madagascar Squacco Herons, a Barn Swallow and a Hippo (first I have seen at the site) at Olmanyi Dam.</P>
<P>On 27<SUP>th</SUP> July Nigel Redman was in Nairobi National Park with a group, and had a pair of African Skimmers at Athi Dam. I believe that this is a brand new species for the Nairobi District as well as the Park.</P>
<P>Best birding,</P>
