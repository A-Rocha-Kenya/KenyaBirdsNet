  <div>A few friends and i were in Tsavo East over the weekend of 14th-15th March.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>On 15th March (sunday), we did the Aruba Dam circuit, where, along&nbsp;the banks among the </div>  <div>foraging&nbsp;Egyptian Geese was 1 Greater Flamingo (?) also foraging. I have never seen&nbsp;G. Flamingo there before..i dont know, but is that normal?</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>I met Moses of Birdwatchingeastafrica a few minutes later and had asked him to go have a look.. wonder if he did?</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>There were also a large number of White Storks and Abdims Storks around the dam..</div>  <div>And on the path&nbsp;Between Aruba dam&nbsp;and Buchuma Gate we saw quite a few Pallid Harriers (feeding on the locusts which seem to be abundant there at the moment).</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Regards,</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Karim.</div><p>&#32;
