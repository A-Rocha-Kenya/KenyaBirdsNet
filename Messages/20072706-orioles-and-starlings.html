  <pre>Many Eurasian Golden Orioles around at present which is the normal time for them to 
build up in number before leaving for Asia... Also today the first day we&#39;ve had large 
flocks of Black-bellied Starlings around this year - flocks of 30-50 over early morning 
and now a large flock chattering away in the casuarinas by the beach. Trumpeter 
Hornbills quite vocal at present along beach front too.

David Ngala has just found the first nest for African Crowned Eagle in Arabuko-Sokoke 
Forest - we&#39;ve suspected them to breed having had them display often over the forest 
but the nest was never located. David - the best known bird guide for ASF - has finally 
managed to retire from being a driver with the Forest Dept and is now employed by 
Friends of ASF as a conservation officer carrying out survey work in the forest for birds 
and illegal activities. We are grateful to those people who know David and how 
passionate and active he is about conserving this globally important forest and who are 
generously supporting his work with FoASF. Anyone else interested in supporting 
David&#39;s work or knowing more about FoASF can get in touch with me.

Happy birding...
