  <pre>Dear all
Spencer Family, Darcy and I did birding at thika last weekend on sat visiting
the Del Monte where Darcy lives then later at Blue Post. Though the destination
was to get to the park we ended up birding in the farm lands and birds included
at least one Levaillants Cuckoo (at first two flying away but later got one on
a tree above our parking space) this is entirely out season which should be
may-sept. If this to be the SE kenya population then they were also out of
seasons which should be here between march to nov.
 
Also Singing, Red-faced, Winding, Rattling Cisticolas and one Croaking Cisticola
calling. A number of African Moustached Warblers and a few grimps of
Broad-tailed Warbler, 3 African Firefich. 

Another nest of Pied Crow with one juv on the same set of pylons.This new nest
is located two pylons after the first I saw last week. The juv was being fed by
the adult was tearing the flesh in to peaces just like a bird of prey.
Fleur Ngweno (our birding lecturer) whos led the Wednesday Morning Birdwalk
organized by the Nature Kenya (birdlife partner in Kenya) and whose hands, most
of local kenyan birdguides have gone through says she hasnt seen the juvs yet
though having been leading these walks since 1971. She has otherwise seen the
nest. I would like to know any info from anyone who&#39;ve seen there juv and
where. 

Only 2 Eurasian migrants Barn Swallows and one Common Whitethoat. 
A male African Finfoot at Blue Post Thika and Grey Olive Greenbul. Songs of
Zanzibar Sombre Greenbul everywhere.  
Blue Post has hiked charges to 150sh but habitat where the two rivers meet is
under clearing for cultivation. The say the part belongs to county council of
Thika and how steep it is mean heavy soil erosion. For you not to pay 150sh
just get in birdwatch and have a 150 shilling worth of lunch or a beer. That
means you were a customer not a birder. So whoever knows how to talk to the
council could do that. May Nature Kenya and birder in general should just send
letter of suggestion or complin to council and try pursued the hotel to talk to
the council.
good birding

With Kind Regards
