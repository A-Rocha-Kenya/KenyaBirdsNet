  <div>Hello all,</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Today morning (14th March), we had&nbsp;the second&nbsp;downpour&nbsp;of the season along the North Coast of Mombasa, and the birdlife was buzzing with activity, a real treat!!</div>  <div>I saw my&nbsp;first of the Violet Backed Starlings of the year and possibly of the season.. There has been&nbsp;a small group of&nbsp;African Golden Orioles that have been around in the compound&nbsp;for sometime now,&nbsp;a little early compared to their usual April-onward&nbsp;appearance.</div>  <div>But the highlight of the morning&nbsp;was an Eleonoras Falcon that stirred a racketuous orchestra of chattering and squawking among the Orioles and Starlings and C. Bulbuls and C. Drongos, which in turn, just briefly&nbsp;let&nbsp;the falcon&nbsp;come into view&nbsp;and swiflty fly right out of sight behind&nbsp;the palm trees.</div>  <div>Later during the day, there was a Lizard Buzzard calling from high up in the Indian Almond tree.</div> 
 <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Karim.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div><p>&#32;
