<BR>
I had to eat my words this week. On an early morning birdwalk at Kasarani Sports Stadium during the BirdLife meeting, I was asked whether several goshawks seen soaring over the grounds the previous day could have been Shikra. &#8220;No Shikra in Nairobi,&#8221; I replied flatly, although we have seen them just outside the city boundary, at Brookside Dairies/Waunyomu Ranch further along the Thika Road. The Annotated Checklist of the Birds of Nairobi by Bill Harvey (1997) says &#8220;No records since 1972.&#8221;<BR>
<BR>
Later as we were returning, we saw a small raptor harassing a flying Black Kite. It was small and compact, entirely pale grey above (no white rump) with darker wing tips, and generally pale below. I believe it was a Shikra.<BR>
<BR>
Other interesting records this week:<BR>
Olivaceous Warbler at Kasarani Sport Stadium, 18 October<BR>
Red-backed Shrike at the Racecourse, 17 October<BR>
<BR>
And several surprises in Nairobi National Park with Robert Gosford from Australia on 20 October: <BR>
About ten Tambourine Doves feeding on cracked Croton seeds on the tarmac<BR>
Yellow-spotted Petronia at the Ivory Burning Site<BR>
A group of Ostriches consisting of two families with young, one clutch about the size of turkeys, the others a little younger, plus one extra female<BR>
A mammal! A huge Ichneumon or Egyptian Mongoose with a tufted tail, where the road crosses a small wetland on the way to Kingfisher picnic site<BR>
But no Superb Starling until we were outside the East Gate<BR>
<BR>
Wishing you good birding, Fleur<BR>
