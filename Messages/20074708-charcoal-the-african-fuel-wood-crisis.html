  <pre>Dear All,

 

Is the removal of `wild wood&#39; for the commercial production of
charcoal (here in Tanzania) supposedly subject to any form of
legislation; if so what does that mean in principle (and, elsewhere on
the continent, what happens in free market reality)?

 

Incidentally the current price per sack (07 February 2007) at a remote
point of sale (i.e. beside the Dar-Arusha highway near Mkomazi
village) is equivalent to US $ 5 or 6, seemingly according to the
`bolus&#39; quality in the sack.

 

Could someone kindly forward this enquiry to other African lists?

 

Asante sana,
