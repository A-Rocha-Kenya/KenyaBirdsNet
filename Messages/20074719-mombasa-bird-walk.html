<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Latest bird walk Sat Feb17th in Nguu Tatu at what 
we call Husein Pond, as averse to Huseini Car Track. Though separated by only a 
road this tends to be a much greener area probably to due to&nbsp;more 
underground water and the&nbsp;fairly large swampy area, now very dry. Migrants 
were the most abundant so far this year. Male and female Common Rock Thrush, 
Northern Wheatear, Barn Swallows, Common Sandpiper, Greenshank, Spotted 
Flycatcher and Eurasian Golden Orioles which are at the momet abundant in the 
Mombasa area (Neem trees at Nyali Beach last Fri. full of them). &nbsp;Other 
species of note Diedrik Cuckoo, not so common these days, Black Shouldered Kite 
and a lot of Long Tailed Fiscal Shrikes, all in pairs, making their delightful 
rattling sounds. Maybe breeding? The birds which have now become pretty numerous 
in this area are the Greater Blue Earred and Superb Starlings.&nbsp;Birds which 
used to be fairly common here Scarlet Chested Sunbird and Nubian Woodpecker we 
no longer see. Maybe the reason is the wholesale lopping of big branches off the 
trees the by firewood seekers.&nbsp; Pity. A last look at a pond on the road 
back, almost in the dark, turned up an Alan's Galinule. A first for that 
particular pond. Am facing the cold of UK for the next 3 weeks so probably won't 
be doing much birding. Wishing you all good birding while I am away. Marlene
