Kenyans Plant Trees To Coax Back Flamingos
April 23, 2007 Â— By Jeremy Clarke, Reuters

NAKURU, Kenya -- Five years ago, dead flamingos
littered the drying shores of Lake Nakuru in Kenya&#39;s
scenic Rift Valley. Sickly birds struggled to stand
upright while stray dogs scavenged on the depleted
flock. 

The once world-renowned heartland of the majestic
birds -- with their long necks and striking pink,
scarlet and black plumage -- was yet another
depressing symbol of deforestation, pollution and
global warming in Africa. 

But now, after two years fighting to reverse their
role in the damage, Nakuru&#39;s local community has set
itself the task of replanting a whole forest they had
razed as a measure of desperation in times of poverty.


They hope that as the flamingos return, so will the
tourists.
