  <pre>Dear All,

A small group spent the day in Nairobi National Park on Saturday 6th 
April, consisting of Mike Davidson, Fleur Ng&#39;Weno, Karen Plum and 
self. There had not been any recent rain but there was a short 
shower in the afternoon.

It was quite quiet for migrants, Barn Swallows were moving in 
numbers, however 174 species were recorded of which 16 were only 
heard.

More interesting records were 4 Black-crowned Night-Herons at 
Nagalomon Dam and another nine at Athi Dam, 2 Black Stork at Athi 
Dam, 2 Open-billed Storks at same place, a Secretarybird on nest, 
the only migrant raptors were 3 Northern Hobbys, Scaly Francolins 
were calling in Kisembe Forest, migrant waders at Athi Dam were 
represented by 15 Little Stints, one each of Ruff, Marsh Sandpiper 
and Greenshank and two Common Sandpipers. A single Eurasian Cuckoo 
was at the Hippo Pools, three Marsh Owls included one spectacular 
bird flying 40 minutes before dark, a single male Brown-backed 
Woodpecker was in a small mixed party in Kisembe Forest, some six 
White-tailed Larks were active after the shower in Athi Basin, a 
single Tree Pipit in Kisembe Forest and three very nice Red-throated 
Pipits at Athi Dam, a solitary Whinchat near Leopard Cliffs, about 
eight Spotted Flycatchers about, one Olivaceous Wwarbler, but an 
Upcher&#39;s bathing in the creek near Kingfisher Picnic Site, and 
amazingly a second bird in low scrub along the railway track near 
Cheetah Gate, only ten Willow Warblers were seen which is much lower 
than expected, but shrikes were even poorer with only five Red-
backed and one Red-tailed. A Broad-tailed Warbler posed well near 
Ivory Burning Site, Lesser Masked Weavers were again in the trees on 
the causeway at Athi Dam and might breed there again.

Best to all

Brian
