This morning (0730 hrs; 19 Sept 07) I counted over 60
Grey Crowned Cranes on a patch within the Brookside
Farm just past Kenyatta University (to the right when
coming from Nbi, next to river valley). Until a few
days ago, the patch has been occupied by a maize
plantation which is now cleared. So probably they was
plenty of food to be eaten

Thought this was a big congregation...
