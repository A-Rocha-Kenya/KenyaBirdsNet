  <pre>Dear Birders,

Hope birding still taking you far. With the migration period still on, 
the storks are enjoying the season. For the last one week at Moi 
University (Chepkoilel campus) have been witnessing the present of the 
storks. At the university ground where the birds are roosting on the 
Eucalpytus tree. On Wednesday, counted a flock of 18 storks, while on 
Thursday,a total of 21 storks. The birds forages on the large farm in 
the campus,taking advantage of the ploughing season at farm.

As well, the Eurasian Bee-eaters within the campus ground.

Have a good birding.

Regards,

Joshua
