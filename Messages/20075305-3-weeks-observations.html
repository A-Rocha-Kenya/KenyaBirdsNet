  <pre>Dear All,

Mike Davidson, Jeffrey James and myself had an outing on Sunday 
(20th May), a round trip to Naivasha.

Firstly we called in at the Manguo Pond (roadside at Limuru), 
nothing too amazing, no migrants but good numbers of local ducks 
included ten Maccoa with one pair engaged in display, fifteen White-
backed included a pair with four ducklings.
