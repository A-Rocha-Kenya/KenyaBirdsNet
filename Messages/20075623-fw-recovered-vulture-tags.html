  <pre>Hello all:

Please see message below from Dr Wagner about locating a dead wing-tagged 
vulture at Shompole. Chances are that the bird (along with other non-tagged 
vultures) may have succumbed to poisoning. As the dry season sets in, it is 
likely that more dead vultures will be found. Please be on the look out.

Thanks,

Munir Virani

&gt; Hi, Munir.
&gt; I was told through the grapevine that you might be the one to contact to 
&gt; report our finding a dead vulture on Shompole (between Lakes Magadi &amp; 
&gt; Natron) which was wearing tags on its wings.  One tag was a large red 
&gt; square #1060 and the other was a small round yellow #26.
&gt; This falls well outside of my circle of knowledge, so I&#39;m hoping you&#39;ll 
&gt; know who&#39;s it is and can pass the information on to them.  We can give 
&gt; them exact GPS coordinates if they want.
&gt; Thanks.
