  <pre>Hello . . . 

Given the recent occurrences in Kenya, can you tell me if wildlife safaris are currently 
operating normally or if there is any limited access into the Rift Valley -- Mt. Kenya, Lake 
Nakuru, Lake Naivasha, Lake Baringo, Kakamega Forest Reserve, or the Maasai Mara Reserve?

Is it really safe?  The State Department, et al,  says &#34;no,&#34; but the tour companies say &#34;yes.&#34;  We 
are trying to decide if we should go on 2/18 birding safari with Elderhostel.

Thank you.
