  <pre>Hello Marilyn,

Reading your message, it is difficult to advise against your own State Dept,
although the daily updates we receive from the Kenya Tourist Board say it is
still safe in most tourist areas, and generally quiet.

However, even they are advising against visiting Western Kenya (basically
Kakamega from your itinerary).

We have a tour currently there, which we rerouted away from Kakamega &amp;
Kisumu for safety, and they seem to have had no problems with the other
areas on your list, which they visited.

My personal opinion is to keep an eye on things for a week or so, and see
what develops, as things are still in a state of flux. 

In general, I would not expect tourists to come under real hassle, but you
also have to bear in mind the safety of your drivers and guides. In these
times of tension, it is not safe for them to be in certain areas if they are
from the &#39;wrong&#39; part of Kenya.

I hope this helps

Nigel

Subject: [KENYABIRDSNET] Birding safari with Elderhostel



Hello . . . 

Given the recent occurrences in Kenya, can you tell me if wildlife safaris
are currently 
operating normally or if there is any limited access into the Rift Valley --
Mt. Kenya, Lake 
Nakuru, Lake Naivasha, Lake Baringo, Kakamega Forest Reserve, or the Maasai
Mara Reserve?

Is it really safe? The State Department, et al, says &#34;no,&#34; but the tour
companies say &#34;yes.&#34; We 
are trying to decide if we should go on 2/18 birding safari with
Elderhostel.

Thank you.
