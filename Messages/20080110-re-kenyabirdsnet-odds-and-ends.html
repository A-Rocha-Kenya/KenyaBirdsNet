  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" ><tr><td valign="top" style="font: inherit;"><DIV>I think the big pond on the right of the Naivasha Road just after the Limuru turn off&nbsp;should be Manguo Pond. A pair of Great Crested Grebes is a very record from that area. Your Lark should be Rufous-naped. Red-winged Lark is quite a large Lark compair to other Lark species about 8.5-9". It prefers lower, drier country than Rufous-naped Lark, i have seen them in Meru NP.</DIV>

<DIV>Cuckoos are&nbsp;brood parasities which means lays eggs in their host. So what you saw was </DIV>
<DIV>a male Klaas's Cuckoo feeding a Female, it&nbsp;happens during the breeding season. I have seen a Diederik Male feeding a Female in the same way you saw that&nbsp;of the Klaas's Cuckoo.</DIV>
