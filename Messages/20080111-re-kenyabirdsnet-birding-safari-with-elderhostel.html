Hi Marilyn
<p>I am replying as a member of the Nature Kenya Bird Committee and I am
also active in an Avi-tourism project .
<p>I will talk to the tourist firms that are involved in bringing in Birdwatchers
and get back to you . Situation re travel is a little fragile at the moment
especially with travel to and from Western .&nbsp; I have a colleague who
has been upto his farm twice this week in Nakuru and reports no problems
on the roads . I also think Mara would be ok , but probably flying in and
out .
<p>Will get back to you as soon as I can
<br>&nbsp;

<p>Given the recent occurrences in Kenya, can you tell me if wildlife safaris
are currently
<br>operating normally or if there is any limited access into the Rift
Valley -- Mt. Kenya, Lake
<br>Nakuru, Lake Naivasha, Lake Baringo, Kakamega Forest Reserve, or the
Maasai Mara Reserve?
<p>Is it really safe? The State Department, et al, says "no," but the tour
companies say "yes." We
<br>are trying to decide if we should go on 2/18 birding safari with Elderhostel.
<p>Thank you.
