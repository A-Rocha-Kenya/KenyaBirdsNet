<P>Dear All,</P>
<P>Today 13<SUP>th</SUP> January I went into Nairobi National Park with Fleur. The recent fires have brought a number of interesting species into the Park, and whilst dams are falling several are in good condition.</P>
<P>We only entered main-gate at 7-30am and left through there at 18-45pm. The area west of Olmanyi dam was not visited, only Hyaena Dam to Hippo Pools and Athi Basin.</P>
<P>Our first stop was a the Ivory Burning Site. There were a few birds here, a few Willow Warblers, an Upcher’s Warbler in the flowering acacia, a couple of Spotted Flycatchers, a Red-tailed Shrike and two Nightingales calling from cover. There was also a distant flock of about forty Eurasian Bee-eaters.</P>
<P>Just a little beyond here a very rare bird in the Nairobi area, an African Hobby streaked past us pursuing a Black Saw-wing, [this is a new species for the Park and the 513<SUP>th</SUP> species recorded here], and there was a female Narina Trogon sitting low in a bush.</P>
<P>Hyaena Dam was impossible to cover with the encroaching Typha blocking the view, although a Hippo was easier to spot. There were a few Yellow Wagtails around the animals here and a Marsh Harrier.</P>
<P>On a burnt area (the junction where the road bridge crosses the Mokiyet) there were four Montagu’s Harriers, a Common Buzzard, singles Common and Lesser Kestrels, three Isabelline, three Northern and two Pied Wheatears, three Whinchats, two Red-tailed Shrikes (with one being a very pale isabellinus), and a flock exceeding a hundred Athi Short-toed Larks. Returning past here there were additionally a Temminck’s Courser, and a couple of pairs of Black-winged Plover and some thirty Barn Swallows presumably heading off to a roost.</P>
<P>Olmanyi Dam provided little apart from four Common Snipe, a couple of Wood Sandpipers and a Greenshank.</P>
<P>Athi Dam was in good condition, and apart from the more usual species were 19 White Stork, a single Open-billed Stork and a solitary Glossy Ibis. There were over forty Little Stints and a similar number of Red-throated Pipits.</P>
<P>Hippo Pools was very unexciting, and rather dry. The Mbagathi level being very low in places.</P>
<P>The Park is at the moment wall to wall mammals, with the success of the recent burns, and well worth going to see.</P>
<P>A Happy and Peaceful New Year to all</P>
