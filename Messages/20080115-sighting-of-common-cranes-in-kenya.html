  <pre>Dear Birders

Below and more detailed is a record I just received of 2 Common Crane (Grus
grus) in Naivasha, Kenya. Also were clear photos of the birds in a flock of
Grey Crowned Crane observed and reported by Francesco Natta

With Kind Regards

hi Chege
how are you doing?
How is you business going?

Do you remember me being guided by you for a short trip, back in october 
2006?
I&#39;m now mailing to you because I tried to submit to the Kenya Bird Committe 
an interesting record of two Common Cranes in the Rift Valley (see below).
Might be you can pass over the message to the Record Committe?
If so, I thank you in advance.
I guess the record might be of some interest.

All the best

Roberto Garavaglia

&gt; dear Sir/Madam
&gt;
&gt; I would like to submit to the Kenya Bird Committee / Records Sub-committee
&gt; the following recent sighting that I think it might be of interest.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; SPECIE: Common Crane (Grus grus)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; SITE: Marula Estate, Naivasha, Kenya
&gt;
&gt;            0° 37&#39;15&#34; S - 36°22&#39;00&#34; E
&gt;
&gt;            about 12 km NW of Naivasha town
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; DATE: from Dec 29th 2007 to Jan 11th 2008 at least
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; OBSERVER: Francesco Natta
&gt;
&gt; NOTE: two adults, observed daily within a flock of Grey Crowned Crane
&gt; (Balearica regulorum), feeding on the leftover at a corn field
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I attach two photos, which have been size-reduced (not cropped) for
&gt; e-mailing. The original files, as shot, are also available (about 1,5 Mb
&gt; each).
&gt;
&gt; I&#39;m writing on behalf of the observer (Mr. Francesco Natta) an Italian
&gt; friend of mine who watched the birds during his stay in Marula and who 
&gt; shot
&gt; the photos. Despite non being a birdwatcher, he was immediately aware of 
&gt; the
&gt; rarity of his sighting.
&gt;
&gt; I&#39;m only aware of one previous sighting of the specie in Kenya, that of 
&gt; one
&gt; bird near Eldoret in 1999, as quoted by Stevenson &amp; Fanshawe on page XXIV 
&gt; of
&gt; their Field Guide to the Birds of East Africa.
&gt; I would like to know from you about the other sightings (if any) of this
&gt; specie in Kenya.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Best regards.
&gt;
