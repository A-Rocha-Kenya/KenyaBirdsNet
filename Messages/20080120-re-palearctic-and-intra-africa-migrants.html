  <pre>Much greetings,

Back to Eldoret for my normal learning. On Tuesday afternoon at the 
Chepkoilel Campus ground, Moi University 5 Eurasian Bee-eaters 
perching on the electricity wire flying for their catch retriving back 
to the wire. In the sky were the Intra-African migrants;7 Abdim&#39;s 
Stork swaying in the air. 

The migrants seem not know the situation on the ground but remembered 
that they are birds and the sky has no boundaries so migration as 
usual.

Nice birding.
Joshua
