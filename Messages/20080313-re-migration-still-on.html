  <pre>Hello Birders,

Everything fine in Eldoret. Birds still on their normal routine as 
the
migration duration almost ending. Unfortunately, the burning of 
Marula swamp full of unpenetratable papyrus reeds adjacent to the 
university ground by the locals-my probably assumption is that; the 
local community are not aware of how important the swamp is to the 
birdlife.
 
On Monday evening, happened to have gone for a birding within the 
Moi University,Chepkoilel Campus ground - sewerage ponds. At the 
ponds saw;3 Red-knobbed coot, 3 Common Sandpiper, 2 Wood sandpiper, 
1 Ruff,1 Common greenshank, 1 Yellow wagtail,6 Little grebe, 1 Grey 
heron, 17 Yellow-billed duck, 23 Hottentot teal, 1 Long-tailed 
cormorant, 2 Egyptian goose,1 hadada ibis and 2 Sacred ibis. As 
well, Short-toed snake eagle. The pond seem to have lot of feeding 
material for the birds with the ducks frequently immersing their 
heads in and out(dubbing-feeding method). Was a great birding moment.

On Wednesday evening, birding for 45 minutes (1745-1830hrs) in the 
grassland and cultivation farm still within the campus ground, 
amazed by the Intra-african migrants 39 Abdim&#39;s stork in the 
cultivation farm that harrowing had just be finished. 13 Common 
kestrel flying and hovering in the sky above the just harrowed 
farm.4 Grey-backed fiscal, 2 Augur Buzzard (adult and a juvenile) 
over 20 ring-necked dove and 5 Eurasian bee-eater.

It have been a great birding week with 13 Common kestrel that have 
never experience.

Nice birding birders.
