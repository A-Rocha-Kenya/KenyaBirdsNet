Nature Kenya&#8217;s Wednesday morning birdwalk recorded several migrants at Splash on 26 March, including a flock of Eurasian Bee-eaters, Barn Swallows, dozens of Willow Warblers, the song of a Sedge Warbler and a Spotted Flycatcher.<BR>
<BR>
Even more exciting were a pair of Cut-throat Finch; the Annotated Checklist of the Birds of Nairobi has no records of this species since 1972.<BR>
<BR>
The highlight of the day, however, were two blood-red flowers of Cyrtanthus sanguineus ssp ballyi. This unusual lily is found in Nairobi National Park and stony grassland in the Nairobi-Machakos-Kajiado area, according to Upland Kenya Wild Flowers, but is seldom seen in bloom.<BR>

Wishing you good birding, Fleur</SPAN></FONT>
