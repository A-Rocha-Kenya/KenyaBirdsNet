<BR>
Still tidying up my records from recent outings. The Easter trip with the Kenya Museum Society, March 19-24, passed through Garissa and Bura. Some highlights:<BR>
<BR>
March 19<BR>
On the road between Ukasi and Garissa, migrants included Eurasian Rollers, Barn Swallows and Olivaceous Warblers.<BR>
<BR>
In the Garissa Giraffe Sanctuary in the afternoon, we saw many birds including a Pygmy Falcon, two large flocks of Vulturine Guineafowl, and Eastern Yellow-billed Hornbills.<BR>
<BR>
March 20<BR>
Golden-breasted Starlings flew right into the tree above our picnic site on the road between Hola and Wenje.<BR>
<BR>
March 23<BR>
Rain had fallen when we returned. On the Bura-Garissa road, about 75 km south of the turnoff to Bura, we saw a Eurasian Marsh Harrier being mobbed by Spur-winged Plovers in the middle of dry thornbush country. This was odd, so we stopped and looked around. Peering under the thornbushes, we saw a small seasonal pool already full of waterbirds, including Green-backed and Black-headed Hersons, African Open-billed Stork, Sacred ibis, White-faced Whistling Duck, Egyptian Goose, Black-winged Stilt and Ruff.<BR>
<BR>
March 24<BR>
An early morning walk by the Tana River at Garissa found a heronry along the river banks, including Black-headed Herons and African Spoonbill with young in the nests. Flocks of Eurasian Golden Orioles and Black-bellied Starlings were feeding in the Neem trees.<BR>
<BR>
On the drive back to Nairobi on the Garissa-Bengali-Ukasi-Mwingi road, migrants included Grasshopper Buzzards, Eurasian Marsh Harrier, Eurasian Rollers and Willow Warblers. <BR>
<BR>
Wishing you good birding, Fleur<BR>
