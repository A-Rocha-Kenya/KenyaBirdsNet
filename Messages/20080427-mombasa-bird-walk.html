<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>All the migrants seem to have disappeared but 
decided to go up to Husein land to see if we could find one or two late 
leavers.&nbsp; Just a few waders on one of the ponds, a couple of Common 
Sandpipers, a lone Greenshank and what was probably a Wood Sandpiper but no 
positive id due to approaching dark.&nbsp; Our favourite pond almost completely 
deserted except for Common Moorhen with several chicks which was wonderful and a 
Three Banded Plover. Everything so dry.&nbsp;On the grassland 2&nbsp;Greater 
Blue Earred Starling, Yellow Throated Longclaw and&nbsp;Long Tailed Fiscal who 
seem to thrive in dry conditions. About a dozen other common species including a 
magnificent pair of Malachite Kingfishers on the pond on the road home.&nbsp; 
Keep birding. Marlene Reid (Mombasa)</FONT></DIV></BODY></HTML>
