  <div>Hello all,</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Made a&nbsp;trip upto Kilifi on Saturday (3rd May),&nbsp;on the road side, before Vipingo Town, in the swamps formed by the&nbsp;rains was a Madagascar Squacco Heron (MaSqOn)..my first for the season..earlier than in the past&nbsp;3 years..Since 2005, we have been noticing it appear in the ponds at Bamburi Cement Nature Trails&nbsp;from&nbsp;mid may onward..though not drastically off, just thought it was worth a note..</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>On another account,&nbsp;on 27th April,&nbsp;i had&nbsp;made a visit to Mt. Kasigau with a friend.. Beautiful mountain with an array&nbsp;of three distinct vegetation types, but most amazing is the&nbsp;lush tropical rain forest that drastically emerges at an elevation of about 1,000mts above sea level all the way to the summit (1,600mts asl).</div>  <div>On the way back down,&nbsp;still within the forest, the guide pointed out to us, amidst gasping for air and sloppily balancing on
 the slippery soil, a group of Montane White Eyes (Taita White-eye, sub sp. silvanus). And though some 15-20metres above us, foraging in the top canopy, and no binoculars to aid us, we could&nbsp;distinctly&nbsp;point out&nbsp;"white eyes" of these White-eye's.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Happy birding and bird&nbsp;merrily to all..</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Karim.</div><p>&#32;
