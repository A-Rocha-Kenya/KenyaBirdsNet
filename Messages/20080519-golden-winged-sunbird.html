  <pre>Dear all

looking out at breakfast yesterday on the bird bath  in my nairobi
garden , there was a Golden-winged Sunbird , to my surprise .

In  Bill Harvey&#39;s checklist of Nairobi birds , its stated as rare , and
I always understood it to be a highland bird , coming off the Aberdares
in winter to warmer places like Naivasha , where I have seen them .

How rare is this ?

Mike D
