  <pre>to all

a group of us , Neema, Shailesh, Joseph K and myself  [ The old world
birdwatch team ]  ventured up to Nakuru on a day trip now that the  road
is completely finished . It is in excellent state  and the journey took
only 2 hours each way and at a leisurely pace .

The water in the lake seems to be ok and about how I found it last
November . However the &#39;pond&#39; near the causeway at the Lake Nakuru Lodge
end is totally dry and hence no water birds . Presume this comes off the
Mau range and is evidence of all we read in the newspapers .

There were hardly any Flamingos , we counted about 200 only . Is this
the time they are all breeding at Natron ?

However the Pelican numbers were very substantial , must have been over
5000 . I have never seen as many on my annual trips there .

We noted 65 species in our 5 hour trip around the lake and the star
turns were two African Cuckoos which were very visible .

Good birding to all

will circulate proposed dates of the Collared  Lark  trip as Biran
metioned in his last  note


happy birding
