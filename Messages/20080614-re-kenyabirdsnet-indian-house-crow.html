  <pre>Dear Neil,
                  When I was working in the Malindi-Watamu (2004-2005) 
area an House Crow control programme was going on in the area.
Control method consisted in poisoning the crows with some special poison 
originally developed to eradicate starlings from U.S (at least this is 
what I was told), which kills the bird some time after the bird has 
eaten it ( to avoid that flock mates to learn). Poisoned bait was given 
to crows in selected strategical areas (where big concentrations of 
crows occurred) under the strict control of a person who made sure that 
no other birds/animals ate the poison (scaring them away with stones 
apparently was enough).
The project was funded by some of the many hotels of the area which see 
Indian crows as pests. The method is cheap (poison purchase and wages 
for one person are actually the only costs) and seemed to be quite 
effective, at least in the short term, but I I have no idea if and how 
it developed in the following years.
The whole programme was implemented and coordinated by Colin Jackson, 
from ARocha Kenya (you might try to contact him for further details).

Hoping that this is of some use.

best regards

Simon Valle
