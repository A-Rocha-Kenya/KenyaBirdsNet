<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN>Am here running a Tropical Biology Association course but it is also great to be here for some good birding. The whether has been very cold and dull generally and this has certainly affected bird densities; numbers are very low and it is very possible most have moved to the lowlands where is warmer. At a mist netting session this morning we caught some very nice birds (see below).&nbsp; We are caught a Cabanis Greenbul with ring number A76300. The ring had badly eaten into the leg; the distal was very swollen and the toes was turned dark-blue. We inevitably removed the ring and hope the bird recovers. Otherwise, some of the special species seen so far include:</SPAN></P>
