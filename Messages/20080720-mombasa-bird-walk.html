<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Can't believe how cold it is here in Mombasa!&nbsp; 
Even the birds are feeling it.&nbsp; On our walk round the South Quarry at 
Haller Park only the water birds seemed to be unaffected.&nbsp; Fantastic 
Herons, especially the Grey with several sub-adults.&nbsp; Several Yellow Billed 
Egrets and a crowd of Yellow Billed Storks which we haven't seen for ages.&nbsp; 
Woolly necks, Palm Nut Vulture, Mangrove Kingfisher, a sole Common Sandpiper and 
a sole Three Banded Plover.&nbsp; Weavers nests recently built seemed to be 
abandoned but lots of Village Weavers in the trees.&nbsp; Maybe they have 
decided it is too cold for breeding?&nbsp; A side trip into Haller Park to see 
if the Giant Kingfisher, seen by Terer the previous day, was still around turned 
out to be disappointing in that we didn'</FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>t catch 
up with the Giant K. but we did see several Black Crowned Night Herons includig 
one sub-adult busily preening and one quite young and very fluffy 
speciman.&nbsp; A fine Fish Eagle at the main lake and several Green Backed 
Herons.&nbsp; A Malachite Kingfisher barely discerned in the gloom and heavy 
rain which sent us all running back to the cars.&nbsp; A rather wet end to a 
great walk.&nbsp; (Marlene Reid - Mombasa)</FONT></DIV></BODY></HTML>
