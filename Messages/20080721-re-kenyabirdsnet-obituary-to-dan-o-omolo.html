<DIV>Dear friends,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I&nbsp;just received the very sad and shocking news regarding the&nbsp;sudden&nbsp;loss of Mr Dan Omondi Omolo, during a 'run for the fun' event in Holland.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>to those who didn't&nbsp;know&nbsp;Dan; Dan was&nbsp;one of the most active&nbsp;young conservationist in Kenya, who used to work at the Nature Kenya office and help on every issue from education to site support groups and&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>'on the ground conservation actions' across the country. Dan&nbsp;left during 2002 to continue&nbsp;with his Master degree and&nbsp;recently started his P.hD studdies.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>It was a great privilege to meet and work with Dan during the time i lived in Kenya. He always found a way forward for&nbsp;un-resolved problems and always with a big smile on his&nbsp;face, a smile that comes alive in these very sad moments.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I&nbsp;would like to convey my deepest regrets and worm wishes to his family and friends&nbsp;in Kenya.</DIV>
