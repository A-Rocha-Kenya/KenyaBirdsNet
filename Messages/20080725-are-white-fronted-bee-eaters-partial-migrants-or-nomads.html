<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>I recently completed a three-week Sunbird safari 
for a private group during which we failed to see a single White-fronted 
Bee-eater.&nbsp; Zimmerman et al state that the species is 'a common 
<STRONG>resident</STRONG> of the Central Kenyan Rift'.&nbsp; However, we 
searched hard for them all around their usual haunts&nbsp;around Naivasha, 
Nakuru, the road north towards Baringo, etc. and couldn't find one.&nbsp; They 
had clearly moved out.&nbsp; Brian Finch was leading a Sunbird/WINGS safari at 
the same time and also failed to find any in the Central Rift, though he did see 
a few in southern Kenya between Amboseli and Tsavo.&nbsp; I was leading the tour 
with Zac Methu who telephoned several of his birding friends and contacts in the 
Naivasha area to ask if they had seen any recently, but he couldn't find anyone 
who had seen one in recent weeks.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Is anyone else aware of this absence?&nbsp; Have 
they returned as yet?&nbsp; Does anyone have any idea where they might have 
gone?&nbsp; I should mention that our three-week safari was a fairly extensive 
one and we travelled as far as Samburu and Lake Baringo in the north, Kakamega 
and Mumias in the west, the Mara in the southwest.&nbsp; There was no sign of 
any White-fronted Bee-eaters throughout this area.&nbsp; The vast majority of 
the population - and possibly the entire population - had clearly moved 
out.</FONT></DIV>
