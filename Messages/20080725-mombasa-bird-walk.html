<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Now all the migrants have departed we have to 
contentrate on the areas where there might just be some birds of special 
interest.&nbsp; Despite the pouring rain we decided to go round the outer limits 
of Haller Park, near the tree nursery area and see if we could&nbsp;catch sight 
of the Narina's Trogon.&nbsp; At the very least this sparked the dampened 
birders.&nbsp; Pole sana!Trogons&nbsp; nowhere to be found but while searching 
we did see 30 other species.&nbsp; Pretty good for a little less than 2 hours. 
Special species were a magnificent African Darter preening in a tree just over 
our heads, Black Crowned Night Herons still sleeping but in good view, lots of 
beautiful Golden Palm, Grosbeak and Village Weavers collecting nest material and 
feeding in large groups. A pair of Spectacled Weavers which are rarely seen on 
our walks. A spectacular Great White Egret. Malachite and Pied Kingfisher and a 
Tawny Flanked Prinia, easily seen for a change. An immature and an adult Palm 
Nut Vulture flew overhead and (cheating a bit) 2 Spotted Eagle Owls and 2 
Verreaux Eagle Owls in the large enclosures, these being rescued orphans reared 
at Haller and too habituated to be let loose.&nbsp; A beautiful, cool, if 
somewhat damp walk in a lovely area full of birds. Join us if you are ever in 
Mombasa on the 3rd Saturday in the month. (Marlene
