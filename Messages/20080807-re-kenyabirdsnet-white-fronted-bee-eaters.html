&gt;  Thanks to Colin for his thoughts. 
&gt;    
&gt;  Below is some additional feedback from Tanzania 
&gt; which suggests that in fact quite a few of their White-fronted Bee-eaters 
&gt; vanished in May as well. 
&gt;    
&gt;  Its a worrying situation.

&gt; airport) 
&gt;  Dear David, 
&gt;  From what I have seen, and from what Anabel tells 
&gt; us, I reckon there was a major exodus in mid May 2008, at least 
&gt; from here - the Arusha area; and one that is taking place, to a 
&gt; varying extent, each year. 
&gt;  I reckon they must go +/- west especially as so 
&gt; few have been seen in the Rift in Kenya. 
&gt;    
&gt;  Best wishes, 
&gt;  James

&gt;  Dear 
&gt; all, 
&gt;    
&gt;  I am sorry but for different reasons 
&gt; I wasn’t able to do any birding around here for most of the month of July, not a 
&gt; very nice coincidence to help you with the bee-eaters 
&gt; accurately. 
&gt;  Looking at my notes and comparing 
&gt; them with what I see in the garden these last 2 days is a bit different indeed. 
&gt; We have no more than 20 bee-eaters at the moment around while on the 
&gt; 17 th of May we enjoyed a group of +200 feeding and diving into the 
&gt; korongo to their roost. 
&gt;  July last year there were days with 
&gt; many more, on the 17 th for instance counted +120 on the power 
&gt; line. 
&gt;  I hope  to be able to go soon 
&gt; to the other side of the korongo to check if some have moved there, since I saw 
&gt; small groups using other nests on that side in 
&gt; June. 
&gt;    
&gt;  Regards to 
&gt; all 
&gt;    
&gt;  Anabel 
&gt;
