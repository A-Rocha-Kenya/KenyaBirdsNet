Fundamentals of Ornithology
A course for bird guides and birders
Elsamere Field Study Centre, Lake Naivasha 
17  25 April 2008

Ornithology Section, National Museums of Kenya, Nature Kenya (the EANHS),
Tropical Biology Association and A Rocha Kenya

Course Fees: 	KSh 28,000 per person for Kenyans ONLY
	US$450 per person for None-Kenyans
The course
Fundamentals of Ornithology, or FoO course is designed for birders (both
professional and amateur) who want to improve their understanding of birds and
their skills in the field.

Birding and bird tourism are growing apace in Kenya. Many companies now have
specialist units devoted to bird watching safaris, and numerous hotels and
lodges have employed resident naturalists. Many people are also discovering
bird watching as an educational and enjoyable pursuit. The IBAs programme, has
also led to steadily increase in the number of local groups with an interest on
birds and their conservation in the last few years.

Many bird guides and birders are very good at identifying the birds they are
used to seeing. However, to be an effective guide, and to make the most of
ones birding, a deeper understanding is required. Fundamentals of
Ornithology aims to give individuals a grasp of the principles behind bird
identification and a sound knowledge of bird biology, thus giving them the
capacity for learning more independently. 

Four key conservation institutions: the Ornithology Section of the National
Museums of Kenya, Nature Kenya  (the East Africa Natural History Society), the
Tropical Biology Association and A Rocha Kenya, are working together to deliver
the 2008 FoO course to be held at Elsamere Field Study Centre, Naivasha.

Course content
Fundamentals of Ornithology is an intensive, fully residential course to be
based at the Elsamere Field Studies Centre on the shores of Lake Naivasha.
Elsamere provides a comfortable environment and an ideal setting for an
ornithological course. Wetland, grassland, savannah and forest habitats are
within easy reach for practical field sessions. Lake Naivasha ecosystem is also
renowned for a wide variety of local and migrant bird species.

Teaching will be in English through illustrated lectures (including discussion
sessions and short practical exercises), group seminars, demonstrations and
field practicals. We try to create an informal environment where participants
can share their existing knowledge and learn from each other as well as from
the course instructors.

Participants can expect to gain the following knowledge and skills: (1) Reliable
identification techniques that can be applied anywhere; (2) A solid general
knowledge of bird evolution, classification, behaviour and ecology; (3) A good
overview of the distribution and conservation requirements of birds in Kenya
and East Africa; (4) A better understanding of the interests and needs of bird
watching visitors; (5) The ability to give visitors interesting, detailed and
well-rounded background information on birds seen anywhere in the country; (6)
An enhanced sense of professionalism and confidence.

Topics to be covered include: birding field craft and ethics  evolution and
classification  scientific names  habitat and distribution  identification:
parts of a bird; finding the right family; making descriptions and taking field
notes; calls; submitting records; using bird guides; wetland, forest and
grassland birds  migration and movements  flight, feathers and physiology 
feeding strategies  breeding behaviour  bird ringing  habitats and
conservation. The full training programme is available on request.
Course assessment
Participants progress will be monitored by continuous informal assessment.
Those who perform to the instructors satisfaction will receive a Certificate
in Ornithology. There will also be exciting awards for exemplary performance
on, and commitment to tasks given during the course.

Instructors
Instructors include leading scientists and conservation managers from the four
institutions involved in organising the course. In the past, visiting speakers
including Simon Thomsett (Co-ordinator of the Peregrine Funds Raptor
Conservation Program in Kenya) and Don Turner (Co-Author of the book and field
guide Birds of Kenya and Northern Tanzania, popularly referred to as
Zimmerman), as well as other internationally renowned persons have talk on the
course. The organisers will at all times endeavour to upgrade the quality of
course and engage suitably qualified persons as teachers. 

Course fees
The course fee is KSh 28,000 or US$450 per person, payable to Nature Kenya for
Kenyan nationals/residents and foreigners, respectively. This subsidised fees
includes full-board accommodation for eight nights at Elsamere Field Study
Centre, transport from and to Naivasha town (at the start and end of the
course, respectively) and during field outings, and all other course materials,
fees, equipment, and teaching expenses. The fees DO NOT cover medical expenses
(participants should have some money on them, at least to cover basic medical
costs during the course, if any).

How to apply
This course targets present or potential bird guides and at keen amateur
birders. Applicants must have some experience of bird watching, and at least
KCSE level of education (a short CV is required with application) and fluent in
English. There is a strict limit of 25 places on the course offered on
first-come-first-served basis. To secure a place, applicants must fill an
application form and return together with a non-refundable deposit of half the
course fees (KSh 14,000 or US$225). Application forms are available at Nature
Kenya - applicants can fill when paying - or electronically from the email
below. Any course fees balance must be paid in full by 1 April 2008 or the
place will be re-allocated.


Background Information about the course site, meeting point/time and what to
bring/expect

The venue  Elsamere, Naivasha
FoO takes place at Elsamere, on the  South Lake Road, Naivasha (beyond
Fishermans Camp and just past the KenGen estate). This is a residential
lakeside facility for conservationists and researchers on the shores of Lake
Naivasha. Elsamere is run by the Elsa Trust, which was set up by the famous
author and artist, the late Joy Adamson. Joys former house forms the main part
of the Elsamere Conservation Centre (ECC). A short distance up the hill is the
Elsamere Field Study Centre (EFSC), which mainly deals with environmental
education. We shall be staying at the the Field Studies Centre.

Meeting up with the course group: course rendezvous
The rendezvous or meeting place for all participants is La Belle Inn, Naivasha,
at 11:00am on first day of the course. La Belle is on the main street through
Naivasha and is a well-known local landmark. Look out for an Elsamere bus or
the NMK or TBA Landrover.  If for some reason you are delayed, call us at
Elsamere and we will give instructions on how to join us - we strongly
encourage puntuality as the course starts soon after we arrive at EFSC (about
noon of the same day). If coming from far, please travel the previous night.

We will only provide transport from La Belle Inn, Naivasha (and also drop off
participants in Naivasha town at the end of the course).  

Accommodation
The EFSC has comfortable rooms, often in bunker beds. We are a large group, so
expect to share showers and toilets. Hot water is usually available in the
evenings. All rooms have electrical sockets.

Things to bring
Naivasha is at 1,900m and it can get cold. Bring warm clothing (sweater/jacket)
for evenings, especially; raincoat (it is likely to be wet at Elsamere and
during the excursion to Kieni Forest); gumboots or hiking boots with good
trend; light walking shoes; and personal effects. 

If you have them, dont forget telescope, binoculars, fieldguides, and a
notebook and pen. We also recommend that you bring a small flashlight and an
extra towel.

Drinks
Elsamere is a conservation centre, not a hotel. There are no bar services
available.

Health and safety...very important!
The course will NOT cover medical expenses incured by participants. However,
there will be a small medical kit for minor health problems.  Participants are
encouraged to bring their own kit with malaria prophylaxies (if needed), insect
repellent, basic painkillers and any other medication currently in use (please
inform us of any condition (healthwise) that might affect your full and free
participation in advance).

Lake Naivasha is full of hippopotamus. These emerge at night to graze on the
shore, often right around the Elsamere buildings themselves. Hippos are VERY
DANGEROUS. DO NOT approach them and DO NOT walk between the two centres at
night without an askari who normally keep an eye on the hippos. 

The tap water at Elsamere is not safe to drink. Boiled water is available in the
rooms/dinning area.

Communications
Telephones and a fax are available at Elsamere. Participants will be charged per
use. Numbers are:

Some background: Lake Naivasha and Hells Gate
Lake Naivasha is situated in central Kenya, and is part of a chain of lakes
dotted along the eastern Rift Valley. At 1,890 m, it is the highest of all the
Rift Valley lakes, and unusual in remaining fresh  there is a permanent
freshwater inflow from the Nyandarua (Aberdare) mountains to the north-east,
and presumably some underground outflow or seepage to the south. The outflow
remains undiscovered.

Naivasha consists of three distinct lakes. The big, shallow main lake (c. 150
km2); a deeper crater lagoon on the eastern edge; and Oloidien, a small (5.5
km2) alkaline lake that is connected to the main lake when water levels are
high. The area has had a chequered history. At the end of the last glacial
period, 10,000 to 12,000 years BP, the area was far wetter and the lake much
larger than at present. It also occupied the basin of what is now Lake Nakuru
to the north, and overflowed through the Njorowa Gorge (Hells Gate) to the
south. For the last 5,000 years, the lake has been much smaller and has
periodically dried up completely. Considerable fluctuations in water level
continue to the present day.

The lakes ecology has been influenced recently by several introduced species.
Until 1925 there was only one species of fish recorded in the lake  an endemic
small tooth-carp that fed on zooplankton.  Since then, several fish species have
been introduced: some have flourished, others have disappeared. Introductions
have not been restricted to fish. The Louisiana red swamp crayfish was
introduced in 1970, while coypu (a large rodent) escaped from fur farms on the
plateau above the lake and arrived in Naivasha from 1965 onwards. Between them,
the coypu and crayfish wreaked havoc on the native vegetation (particularly
water lilies and submerged aquatic plants). The coypu eventually went extinct
around 1984, an event questionably hastened by the further introduction of
pythons as a control measure!

Meanwhile the lake was invaded by floating weed Salvinia molesta which spread
over a substantial part of its surface. In the early 1990s a salvinia-eating
weevil was introduced as a control measure, and appears to have sent the weed
into a rapid decline. However, an even more noxious invader has appeared: the
water hyacinth Eichhornia crassipes, which was first recorded in 1988 and has
spread steadily, though relatively slowly by its standards, ever since.

The vegetation of Naivasha is directly affected by the lake levels. At the
moment much of the shore is fringed with dense stands of feathery papyrus, with
floating mats of water hyacinth on the open water. 

The lake is of great economic importance to Kenya. Irrigated floriculture and
horticulture have expanded to cover sizeable tracts of land around it. These
industries employ large numbers of people and provide important export earnings
for the country. The lake also supports a substantial fishery and a growing
tourist industry. In addition its water cools the turbines of the geothermal
power at nearby Ol Karia. However, the lake is under threat from several
directions: the effects of introduced species; water chemistry changes due to
increased water off-take and inputs of agricultural chemicals, unregulated
fishing, and the clearance of swamp and fringing vegetation. All the land
around the lake is privately owned, and these riparian owners have taken the
lead in planning conservation efforts. They were instrumental in having
Naivasha listed in March 1995 as a wetland of international importance under
the Ramsar Convention. Lake Naivasha is an Important Bird Area because of the
large congregations of waterbirds it supports.

Situated about 6 km from Elsamere, the small Hells Gate National Park is
bordered by intensive farming on one side and the grazing lands of Maasai
pastoralists on the other. The gorge within the park (Naivashas former
outflow) is spectacular, with columnar cliffs towering 120 m high, and two
impressive volcanic plugs that stand as towers. The vegetation is a mix of
grassland, woodland and scrub, the last dominated by the unpalatable leleshwa
bush, Tarconanthus camphoratus. The park also encloses the site of Africas
first geothermal power station, a zone of hissing steam vents and fissures.
Some of the common large mammals include Silver-backed Jackal, Kongoni or
Cokes Hartebeest, Plains Zebra, Klipspringer, Eland, Cape Buffalo and Warthog.
The cliffs provide important breeding sites for birds of prey, notably a colony
of Rüppells Griffon Vultures.

&gt; Hi!Birders,
&gt; 
&gt; I live in Nairobi, Kenya and would like to know if there is any 
&gt; institution 
&gt; other than the weekly birdwalks by the Nature Kenya, that offers 
&gt; birding classes. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
