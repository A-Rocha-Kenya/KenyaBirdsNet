<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dear Birders,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>A visit to Nguuni Sat. 16th as a farewell bird 
walk&nbsp;for one our most ardent members who is taking off for Zambia in 
mid-Sept.&nbsp; Nguuni is a place where we nearly always see quite&nbsp;a number 
of indigenous species despite water birds now being in low numbers due to over 
grazing of the water vegetation by the larger number of waterbucks, hopefully 
this will be rectified to some extent by the recently formed wetland.&nbsp; The 
other downside is we have to pay to go in!&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Red Capped Robin Chat was one of the first birds we 
saw, a bird which always seems to return to the same acacia trees.&nbsp; Wetland 
had fair number of White Faced Tree Ducks, Water Dikkops, Zanzibar Red Bishops, 
various Egrets and Herons, a single African Jacana, couple of Three Banded 
Plovers and special for the area Two Open Billed Storks, not seen for 
ages,&nbsp; other special bird as it has been significantly absent for a long 
time was Little Grebe probably at least half a dozen, hard to count due to much 
ducking and diving.&nbsp; Up on the grassland Greater Blue Earred Starling, 
Bare-Eyed Thrush, Mangrove Kingfisher, Pangani Longclaw, Palm Nut Vulture, 
Yellow Bill, Sulpher Breasted Bushshrike, lots of Red Billed Quelea and as dark 
fell the best part of the walk a family of Verreaux Eagle Owls. Two adults, one 
sub-adult and a much smaller baby owl.&nbsp; They had been roosting in the Doum 
palms and suddenly became active, sub-adult trying to catch a bird, withut 
success.&nbsp; We have seen single owls here many times before but never so 
many.&nbsp;A very fitting end for a farewell birdwalk.&nbsp; As we walked back 
to the cars for a small "goodbye" picnic, Slender Tailed Nightjars were calling 
from every side and swooping overhead.&nbsp; Total number of species seen 40 (39 
if you leave out the Ostrich at the farm). If you are in Mombasa please join us, 
every 3rd Sat of the month. (Marlene Reid - Mombasa)</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>P.S. to all birders - if any of you has a contact 
in Zambia (Lusaka) of a bird group, individual birder etc could you please let 
me know so I can pass it on to my friend.&nbsp; She has been in Msa for the last 
3 years and has been a great member of our group.&nbsp; Also if you know of any 
field guide to birds of Zambia.&nbsp; So far she has not been able to trace one 
and it would seem all South African books stop short at the Zambezi.&nbsp;
