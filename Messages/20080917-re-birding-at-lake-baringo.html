Hello all,

Hope you all well with birding. On September 10 went birding trip to
Lake Baringo with Jack Windsor (birder from Canada)after his two week
birding trip to Uganda. On specialist by evening were Heuglin&#39;s
Courser, African darter,Grey heron, Jackson&#39;s, African grey,
Red-billed and Hemprich&#39;s Hornbills, Bristle-crowned starling,
Rofous-crowned roller, Jackson Golden-backed weaver, Rufous chatterer,
Beautiful sunbird. A walk along the hanging &#39;red cliffs&#39; sourced
Bristle-crowned starling, Spotted (Greyish)Eagle owl, Common Ostrich,
5 Dark chanting goshawk and Barn Swallow.

On September 11, birding in Lake Nakuru had Lesser flamingo but not on
their large numbers as compared to other times;Pink-backed
pelican,tens of Yellow-billed Storks, Saddle-billed stork, Common and
Marsh Sandpipers, Grey-headed gull, Tawny eagle, Secretary bird,
Ruppell&#39;s Long-tailed starling,Broad-billed and Lilac-breasted rollers
Cliffchat, Coqui francolin and Grey-backed fiscal. Also had a chance
to visit Lake Oloiden in Naivasha; Hundreds of Great Cormorant,
Yellow-billed duck, Red-billed and Cape teals, Little grebe and lesser
flamingos.

Last stop at the Flyover (Kinangop Grassland) were lucky to get the
endemic Sharpe&#39;s Longclaw after about 15 minutes search with very poor
weather since it was just after a heavy downpour.

Addition:
Sometime back about 3 weeks ago, spot a flock of 4 White-crested
helmet shrike in Chepkoilel Campus, Moi University in Eldoret.

Have a great birding moment.

Joshua
