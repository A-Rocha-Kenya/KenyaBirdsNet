  <pre>Dear All,

I made a swift week&#39;s trip last week to Amboseli, Tsavo West and Masai Mara,
and here&#39;s some interesting birds/migrants en route:

Whistling Thorns: There were some species more readily associated with
further down in the gardens, including Chestnut Sparrow and Southern
Grosbeak Canary. This was before the rains came.

Namanga: A few White-fronted Bee-eaters about.

Amboseli: Lots of migrant waders (Wood Sandpiper, Marsh Sandpiper, Ruff,
Little Stint), but grounds of Ol Tukai Lodge virtually birdless, except a
single breeding-plumage Taveta Golden Weaver on the last morning. No rain.

Tsavo West: Female Pallid Harrier. Spots of Rain

Masai Mara: Several Northern Wheatears, a few Barn Swallows and a male
Montagu&#39;s Harrier. Lots of Rain!

Good birding

Nigel
