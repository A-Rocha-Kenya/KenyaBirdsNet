  <pre>Dear All,

On Friday 12th December 2008 I went into Nairobi National Park with 
Rupert Watson. It was a bright sunny morning and continued sunny all 
day. On arrival at the Main Entrance, the trees around the car-park 
were thronging with birds, and amongst the usual residents were a 
number of Blackcaps, Olivaceous and Willow Warblers. At Ivory 
Burning Site there was not a lot of activity, plenty of Yellow-
billed Kites were scavenging from a recent event, and with them was 
an adult Black Kite. Other than this there were a single Eurasian 
Bee-eater, three Nightingales, a few Tree Pipits and a Spotted 
Flycatcher.
Hyena Dam had very little as well, there was a calling African Water 
Rail, but a compact flock of fifteen Crowned Cranes was an unusual 
sight for the Park.
The grasslands around here were very rich and we had four Rosy-
breasted Longclaws, two Whinchats, a male Parasitic Weaver and the 
grasslands were full of Quailfinch. A male Saddle-billed Stork fed 
in swamps along the Mokoyiet River.
At Kingfisher Picnic Site the resident male Pied Wheatear was in 
residence, but little else apart from a passing Pallid Harrier and a 
Steppe Eagle overhead. 
Near here there were a Northern Wheatear, and the first of five Red-
tailed Shrikes seen today. Below Leopard Cliffs there was a Booted 
Eagle.
