  <pre>Just a short report on a some of the birds seen recently in Shimoni, mainly in our 
garden. A Brownbreasted  Barbet has been in to the birdbath and in to the White 
Bauhinia tree near the house a couple of times. We don&#39;t see thm very often these 
days. We also had 3 Ashy Flycatchers in to the birdbath on Sunday 23rd, I have not 
see these around for a couple of years in the garden.  Sunday 23rd Nove. Pat found 3 
Phalaropes out towards the centre of the Pemba Channel.  Thursday 27th November 
Fischers Touracos heard calling early in the morning from the bush behind. We used 
to hear these daily, but due to all the clearing and building behind us we very seldom 
hear them these days, so it was nice to hear that they hadn&#39;t vanished completely. 
Crowned Hornbills made their appearance in the middle of November and are now 
around all the time. Red-capped RobinChats have not been calling in the early 
morning this month, previously they have been calling every morning between May 
and end October. Plenty of Carmine Bee eaters along the road past Ramisi Sugar 
Estate, they have been there in their numbers since September.
Hardly any waders seen near our plot, and no Spotted Flycatchers so far this year.
