<FONT FACE="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><SPAN STYLE='font-size:12.0px'>Dear Mike and All,<BR>
I had a golden-winged in Langata a few years ago and I believe it too was at this time of year &#8211; I will have to check my notes. &nbsp;Up here on our place in Laikipia we have had a sudden influx in our area of Bare-eyed Thrush (three sightings in the last week). &nbsp;Also Rufous Rollers seem to have arrived, after a time away, in the past three weeks.<BR>
On the mammal front we have seen two aardwolves in the past two days, a cheetah, four wild dog and three lion last week and we are currently under siege from a few hundred elephant determined to wreck all our pretty shade trees.<BR>
Best to all, <BR>
James Christian<BR>

Dear all<BR>
<BR>
looking out at breakfast yesterday on the bird bath &nbsp;in my nairobi<BR>
garden , there was a Golden-winged Sunbird , to my surprise .<BR>
<BR>
In &nbsp;Bill Harvey's checklist of Nairobi birds , its stated as rare , and<BR>
I always understood it to be a highland bird , coming off the Aberdares<BR>
in winter to warmer places like Naivasha , where I have seen them .<BR>
<BR>
How rare is this ?<BR>
<BR>
