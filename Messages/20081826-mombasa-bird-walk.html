<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Greetings to all birders,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Mombasa is still getting a fair amount of rain so 
everything is beautiful and green and it is pleasantly cool.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Sat. 21st&nbsp;June - the walk was around the 
periphery of Nguuni, outside their fence, through the tree nursery and over the 
grassland into what used to be the shale quarries but which is now becoming a 
good wetland area due to some damming of runoff water further up the hill.&nbsp; 
Plenty of bird activity in this area, Village, Grosbeak and Golden Palm Weavers 
in a frenzy of nest building, stripping all the palms they could find.&nbsp; Big 
numbers of Zanzibar Red Bishops and Northern Brownbuls (heard rather than 
seen).&nbsp; Specialities of the day Pangani Longclaw, Flappet Lark, Lizard 
Buzzard busy hunting, African Jacana on the wetland, these have been absent for 
ages, White Faced Whistling Ducks (one of our favourites), 2 Woolly necked 
Storks, Long Tailed Cormorant, and quite rare for us 2 Pied Crows. In less than 
2 hours we had a list of 33 species. Once the wetland really gets established we 
hope to see lots of migrant waders there. This is going to be a very good 
birding area.&nbsp; Wishing you all enjoyable and happy birding - Marlene Reid
