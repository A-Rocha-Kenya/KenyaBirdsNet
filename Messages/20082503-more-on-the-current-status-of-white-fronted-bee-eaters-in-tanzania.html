<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>James Wolstencroft has just come back from two days 
in the field and checked out&nbsp;a&nbsp;few White-fronted Bee-eater 
colonies.&nbsp; Here are his findings and&nbsp;thoughts:</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#0000ff>"On July 31 we saw only about eight or nine 
White-fronted Bee-eaters at a breeding site at ca 1,550 m along the Nairobi road 
ca 12 km west of Arusha and 4 km short of Lengijave; which is the main watershed 
as you go west around Mount Meru.&nbsp; </FONT><FONT color=#0000ff>There was 
none at the large breeding site in a korongo&nbsp;at Mkuru camel camp at ca 1650 
m which is on the dry northern side of Meru; nor were there any in colonies at a 
similar elevation&nbsp;right on&nbsp;the watershed&nbsp;of Lengijave 
itself.&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#0000ff></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#0000ff>My feeling is that they temporarily evacuate all the 
higher and drier sites en masse,&nbsp;and that only&nbsp;a few individuals 
remain&nbsp;near&nbsp;to the lower&nbsp;colonies (at say 1,550m and below) and 
these few are present only&nbsp;whilst they are finding enough food in the 
immediate vicinity. </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#0000ff></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#0000ff>The Arusha sites mentioned by Marc, Paul and Fred are 
all lower, floristically richer, typically more agricultural, suburban and/or 
forested&nbsp;so that&nbsp;clearly&nbsp;there are&nbsp;many more hymenopterans 
and butterflies active in these&nbsp;relatively lush areas during the cool and 
often dry days of late mid-winter.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#0000ff></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#0000ff>It would be interesting to compare this with Anabel's 
experiences at Magongo hill which is at about the same elevation as Marc's birds 
i.e similar to that of Arusha airport."</FONT></DIV></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>It would be interesting to know whether it is just 
the colonies at higher elevations in Kenya that have been abandoned 
too.</FONT></DIV>
