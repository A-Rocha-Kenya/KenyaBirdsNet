<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Another trip up to Vipingo Ridge in the early 
morning last week, where we spent all our time wandering in the extensive bush 
land. Species of note; African Goshawk, Scaly Babblers, Red Tailed and Red 
Backed Shrike (Red-tailed more numerous, mostly Isabelline) lots of Eurasian 
Golden Orioles, Crested Eagle flying over, Eurasian Marsh Harrier, Carmine 
Bee-Eaters which would seem to be around Mombasa just now, Spotted Flycatchers, 
and in the garden during our late breakfast, Pallid HoneyGuide and Brown Hooded 
Kingfisher. We are trying to take full advantage of this wild area before it 
become developed and are sincerely hoping that there will be a fairly large area 
of bush left for posterity. (Marlene Reid, Kevin, James and
