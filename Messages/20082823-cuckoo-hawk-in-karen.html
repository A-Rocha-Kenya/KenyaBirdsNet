<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dear All</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>A few days ago, I got a call from a fellow birder, 
Heather Elkins, who lives on Nandi Road, Karen, to report that she had a 
Cuckoo-Hawk in her garden. I rushed down to her house and there in the top of a 
dead tree he sat and we were able to enjoy him for at least 15 mins. This was a 
Lifer for both of us!</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>On Mwitu Estate, Karen, we have enjoyed frequent 
good sightings of a Crowned Eagle unfortunately being mobbed by many Pied Crows 
who seem to appear from nowhere!</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Best wishes and good birding</FONT></DIV>
