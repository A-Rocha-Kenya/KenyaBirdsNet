<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dear Birders,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Am&nbsp;reading about&nbsp;allsorts of exciting 
birds seen upcountry by all you guys, making Mombasa seem pretty 
quiet.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Oct bird walk at Nguuni Sanctuary, led by Kelvin 
Mazera had some interesting species. African Pygmy, Mangrove and Malachite 
Kingfishers, White Browed and Red Capped Robin Chat, White Faced and Fulvous 
(one only which hangs around with the White Faced) Whistling Ducks, Spur Winged 
Plover, Carmine Bee-Eater (one or two), Little Grebe (increasingly scarce at 
Nguuni). Only one migrant, a Wood Sandpiper.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Nov bird walk in Nguu Tatu we hoped to see the 
recently formed &nbsp;wetland full of migrant waders.&nbsp; Unfortunately there 
had been heavy rain and there was just too much water and the swamp was pretty 
empty.&nbsp; However we did see 3 small groups of Wood Sandpipers and several 
Common Sandpipers and a group of 3 Greenshanks.&nbsp; The only other migrants 
were Barn Swallows flying overhead.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other birds of special note were 
a magnificent African Darter, a Little Grebe and a Yellow Bill.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Good to see Eurasian Golden Orioles passing through 
my garden in Tudor but otherwise the migrant scene seems a little bleak.&nbsp; 
Have not even seen a Spotted Flycatcher.&nbsp; Wishing you all good birding -
