<FONT FACE="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><SPAN STYLE='font-size:12.0px'>Hello All,<BR>
<BR>
I would like to thank all the kind people that sent their ideas and contacts regarding Birding in Diani. While we only had one morning we had an excellent time and we&#8217;re thoroughly impressed with the patches of forest that remain. &nbsp;I should mention that </SPAN></FONT><SPAN STYLE='font-size:12.0px'><FONT FACE="Geneva, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">Manju Mohamedbhai recommended a local bird guide in Diani but unfortunately we forgot to write down the number which was on my computer before we left. &nbsp;I will republish that numnber here though for the record, should anyone be looking for a Diani Guide at a later date:<BR>

</SPAN></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><SPAN STYLE='font-size:12.0px'>Munir Virani was also kind enough to recommend conservation Officer at Sokoke David Ngala who came down on a matatu to meet us and bird some of the areas that he and Munir censused for sokoke scops owls. &nbsp;First we went into the patch of forest behind Nomad&#8217;s. &nbsp;This is a beautiful remnant and the owners should be commended for stewarding such important habitat for this long.<BR>
In this patch we found:<BR>
<BR>
Ash Flycatcher<BR>
Olive Sunbird<BR>
Fischer&#8217;s Greenbul<BR>
Zanzibar Sombre Greenbul<BR>
Yellow-bellied Greenbul<BR>
Northern Brownbul<BR>
Yellowbill<BR>
Green Barbet<BR>
Eastern Green Tinkerbird<BR>
Yellow-rumped Tinkerbird<BR>
Tropical Boubou<BR>
Black-crowned Tchagra (heard)<BR>
Brown-crowned Tchagra (heard)<BR>
Black-backed Puffback (heard)<BR>
Walberg&#8217;s Eagle (possible &#8211; fleeting glimpse)<BR>
Ornage-capped Robin Chat<BR>
Mombassa Woodpecker <BR>
Silery-heeked Hornbills<BR>
<BR>
Also David saw a Giant Elephant Shrew which he said he hadnt observed during the cours of their owl censusing.<BR>
<BR>
We then went on to Kaya Kinondo which was a very impressive forest. &nbsp;I think it is such a pity that here in Kenya we don&#8217;t spend more time marketing natural history and the interesting smaller animals like the birds, frogs, butterflies, etc. Costa Rica does and tourists there are routinely able to identify the morpho butterfly, the leaf cutter ants or poison dart frogs, having never before seen them, because they are all part of the marketing for the country. &nbsp;Here in Kenya it is the big five tu. &nbsp;This is a shame and it is exemplified by how few Diani tourists visit Kaya Kinondo. Anyway, as for birds we saw the following:<BR>
<BR>
Red-tailed Anthrush<BR>
Mangrove Kingfisher<BR>
Tiny Greenbul (heard)<BR>
Plain-backed Sunbird<BR>
Forest Batis<BR>
<BR>
Also, Speckled Tree Snake eating a gecko and then climbing vertically up a straight smooth tree trunk of a wide diameter &#8211; which was rather impressive. Unfortunately we did not get time to check on a pair of large hornbills that are supposedly nesting at </SPAN></FONT><FONT SIZE="4"><FONT FACE="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><SPAN STYLE='font-size:14.0px'>Shaanti Spa (after Robinson&#8217;s Baobab) </SPAN></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><SPAN STYLE='font-size:12.0px'>. Fleur Ng&#8217;weno asked me to verify the species and so should anyone else be passing they might want to have a look and report back to Fleur &#8211; sorry Fleur.<BR>
<BR>
Cheers, James Christian<BR>
