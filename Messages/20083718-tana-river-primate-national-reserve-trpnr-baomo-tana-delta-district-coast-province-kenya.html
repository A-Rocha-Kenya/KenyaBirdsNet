  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" ><tr><td valign="top" style="font: inherit;"><o:p></o:p>Dear birders and friends:

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Kindly accept my deepest
apologies for the late posting. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">The above trip took place from
Thursday 4 – Monday 8 September 2008. The long drive to the Michelelo Research
Camp (MRC) was approached using the dirt-back-route from <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Hola</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Town</st1:PlaceType> via Wenje and <st1:place w:st="on">Maroni</st1:place>
respectively. Please take note that there were no signposts to the said camp. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">All the “specials” of the area
including the Primates – Tana River Red Colobus <i style="">Piliocolobus rufomitratus</i>, Tana River Crested Mangabey <i style="">Cercocebus torquatus</i>, Bush-baby <i style="">Galago spp. </i>were recorded.<i style=""> </i>Others primates included sightings of
the Yellow Baboon <i style="">Papio cynocephalus</i>,
Sykes’ Monkey <i style="">Cercopithecus albogularis</i>,
and the Black-faced Vervet Monkey <i style="">Cercopithecus
aethiops</i>. The trip’s highlight was the sighting of the Hirola Antelope <i style="">Beatragus hunteri</i> <i style="">c.</i>21. Herewith, please, find the full log of the trip’s account.
Total bird’s species tally stood at 131.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><b style="">Wednesday 3 September 2008: </b>Rupert Watson and I left <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Nairobi</st1:place></st1:City> for Thika. We had
an overnight at our teammate Gordon Boy parent’s home. A short evening birding
stroll in the surrounding environs yielded Northern Pied Babbler, African Green
Pigeon, Red-faced Crombec, Ruppell’s Robin Chat, Tawny-flanked Prinia,
Grey-crowned Crane, and the Montane Nightjar.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><b style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><b style="">Thursday 4:</b> We left Thika for lower <st1:place w:st="on">Tana River</st1:place>
following the Thika – Garissa road. By 13h00, we refueled in Garissa. The numbers
of the breeding Marabou Stork <i style="">Leptoptilus
crumeniferus c.</i>60 on the <i style="">Acacia</i> <i style="">sp.</i> flanking the Tana River over the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Madogo</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Bridge</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
crossing were amazing. Further, on past the junction to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mombasa</st1:place></st1:City> off the Thika-Garissa road (near the Kenya
Broadcasting Corporation’s Madogo Radio Station), we encountered a pair of the
Somali Ostrich with 17 young ones.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">By late evening, we had reached
our destination – MRC, settled and had a short walk on the fringes of the
forest. A dead Doum Palm <i style="">Hyphaene sp.</i>
was a beehive of activities with the Beaded Woodpecker, Green Wood-hoopoe and
the Black-bellied Starling according us a warm reception. While heading back to
the camp, Nubian Nightjar flirted back and fro. A good number of small bat
species according to Gordon were <i style="">Pipistrellus<br>
sp. </i>They were noted dashing along the trails. The African Wood Owl hooted and
gave contact calls all nights from dusk to dawn. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><b style="">Friday 5:</b> The morning choruses of the forest birds were like
musical orchestra, with the lead rhythm by Red-capped Robin Chat and
Eastern-bearded Scrub Robin, Ruppell’s Robin Chat and a full back-up coordinated
by the Dark-backed Weaver and the Trumpeter’s Hornbill were in full musical vibrancies.
A short walk to the river bank was fruitions us we encountered a
“bird-hunting-party” which consisted of the following species African Pygmy,
Yellow-billed Coucal, Tropical Boubou, Black-backed Puffback, Red-tailed
Ant-thrush, Rufous Chatterer, Black Cuckoo-shrike, Black-headed Oriole, African
Paradise Flycatcher (white morph), Black-throated Wattle-eye and the Common Drongo.
In the background, the calls of the White-browed Coucal, coo of the Red-eyed
Dove, piping call of the African Grey Hornbill, musical notes of the Zanzibar
Sombre Greenbul and the two-stones clapping calls of the Green-backed Camaroptera
were ear-appealing. The recording of the near-threatened Plain-backed Sunbird
was rewarding. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">The <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Red-bellied</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Coast</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
Squirrel <i style="">Paraxerus palliates </i>were amidst
the party. The water birds comprised of White-faced Whistling Duck, Hadada and
Glossy Ibises, Pied, Brown-hooded and the Chestnut-bellied Kingfishers, African
Pied Wagtail, Common Sandpiper, Spur-winged Plover, Egyptian and the
Knob-billed Geese, Water Thick-knee. With the heat of the day, the Nile Crocodile
<i style="">Crocodylus niloticus</i> were basking in
the sun. The grunting calls of the Hippopotamus <i style="">Hippopotamus amphibius</i> were heard severally.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">A mid-morning forest walk led to
another “bird-hunting-party” which comprised of the rich forest species
Terrestrial Brownbul, Fischer’s Greenbul, Ashy and Blue-mantled Flycatchers. A
vulnerable species - the Little Yellow Flycatcher was noted. In addition,
Little Spotted Woodpecker, Yellow-rumped Tinkerbird (observed boring a nesting
hole on a dead tree branch). On the return leg back to the camp, we got great
views of the Tana Red Colobus Monkey, Tana River Crested Mangbey, and Sykes’
Monkeys and a troop of Yellow Baboon. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">The forest floor-dwelling butterfly
species were numerous. The dominant species being the Gold-banded Forester <i style="">Euphaedra neophron.</i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Later we drove from the MRC to the
Park Headquarters in Baomo, 10 kms away. Enroute the following birds’ species
were encountered: Crested Francolin, Vulturine Guineafowl, Namaqua and Emerald-spotted
Wood Doves, Common Bulbul, Carmine Bee-eater, Cardinal Woodpecker, Red-fronted
Barbet, Black-headed Plover, Northern White-crowned Shrike, Golden-breasted and
the Wattled Starlings, Marabou Stork, Pale Flycatcher, White-headed and the
Red-billed Buffalo Weavers, Blue-naped Mousebird.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">At the Kenya Wildlife Service
(KWS) Camp, Baomo, the camp offered an array of bird species notably the Little
Bee-eater, Fisher’s and Superb Starlings, African Mourning Dove, Wire-tailed
Swallow, Little Swift, Grey-headed Silverbill, and the Grey Wren Warbler.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">A sundowner birding session along
the banks of the <st1:place w:st="on">Tana River</st1:place>, near the KWS
water pump station was exciting with further recording of the sunbirds - Amethyst,
Collared and Eastern Violet-backed Sunbirds, Green-backed Heron; Gabar Goshawk <i style="">Micronisus gabar</i> (was mobbed and chased
away by the Water Dikkops <i style="">c.</i>15).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Back at the camp, the Small-spotted
Genet Cat <i style="">Genetta genetta</i> was our
night guest, while, the calls of the hyena were heard from a distance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><b style="">Saturday 6:</b> Within the camp precincts, mimicking the Narina’s
Trogon was fruitful, as a male responded and flew to a patch above our heads. The
Regionally threatened species, the African Crowned Eagle <i style="">Stephanoaetus coronatus</i> landed on an open top patch obediently waiting
its ticking-off the muster roll. Other birds such as the Tambourine Dove, Madagascar
Bee-eater, Lanner Falcon <i style="">Falco biarmicus</i>,
and the African Green Pigeon were added to the list.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">We took a mid-morning boat trip
and crossed to the eastern banks of the reserve, opposite the MRC in search of
the Hirola Antelope, but in vain. Other mammals seen included the Reticulated
Giraffe <i style="">Giraffa camelopardalis reticulata,
</i>Dik-dik, and the Warthog. The birds of the said area included Klaas Cuckoo,
Lilac-breasted Roller, Palm-nut Vulture <i style="">Gypohierax
angolensis</i> (1 immature), Striped Kingfisher, Golden Pipit <i style="">c.</i>9, Hunter’s Sunbird (immature male),
White-bellied Bustard, Rattling Cisticola, Black-faced Sandgrouse, Long-tailed
Fiscal, Wooly-necked Stork, Barn Swallow (the first one for me this southward-bound
migration season). After the long walk, of which I was privileged to add a
“lifer” to my list – the VIOLET-BREASTED SUNBIRD! We turned back and took a
1-km boat ride due north of the camp. Sacred Ibis, Common Greenshank, Marsh
Sandpiper and the Grey Heron were add-ons. A picture posing Nile Monitor Lizard<i style=""> Varanus niloticus </i>was basking on the riverbank.
Late evening we took another walk on the fringes of the MRC forest due south
and we added a Little Sparrowhawk <i style="">Accipiter
minullus</i>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><b style="">Sunday 7: </b>The morning stroll around the camp and the river frontage
was rewarding with sightings of the Globally threatened species Fischer’s
Turaco. The other exciting sightings included the Crested Guineafowl (on top of
a tree approximately 20mts high), Broad-billed Roller, Black-headed Heron,
Yellow-billed Stork, Ruppell’s Long-tailed Starling, Brown-breasted Barbet,
Osprey <i style="">Pandion haliaetus</i> and Von der
Decken’s Hornbill.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><b style="">Monday 8: </b>We again went back for the Hirola Antelope search and it
was successful as we ended up seeing five groups, each group consisting of
individuals of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 respectively. Rosy-patch Shrike and Bateleur <i style="">Terathopius ecaudatus</i> were logged-in. Group
<i style="">c.</i>6 of the Common Waterbuck<i style=""> Kobus ellipsiprymnus</i> was noted. We also
did a scouting of the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Sifa</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">East</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Forest</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.
It was fantastic seeing great clusters of the Borassus Palm <i style="">Borassus aethiopum.</i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">To crown our trip, we took a late
afternoon boat ride 3 kms due north of the river course and we made a new entry
of the Open-billed Stork, African Darter, Pink-backed Pelican, Brown Snake
Eagle <i style="">Circaetus cinereus</i> and the Black-crowned
Night Heron. To sum up the mammals list a pair of Black-tipped Mongoose <i style="">Galerella sanguinea</i> and Bush Squirrel <i style="">Paraxerus sp.</i> were seen foraging off the
food scrapes near the camp kitchen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">With the expertise of a local
guide, Abio, we were able to see the Tana River Poplar tree <i style="">Populus ilicifolia</i>. Other tree species
in bloom were the <i style="">Albizia </i>and <i style="">Acacia</i> <i style="">spp</i>. respectively.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">On a sad note, the state of the
camp was deplorable state, with the <i style="">“makuti”</i>
thatching</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">covering the tents giving in,
broken down generator for pumping water and lights. The boat engine was not in
the finest state too, thus, hindered us to do more river expeditions. In
addition, there is a dire need of putting up signposts. It is my sincere hope
that the KWS management team will take a swift course of action and remedy the
situation at hand!<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">On behalf of the team and myself,
I do sincerely thank the Boy’s family for their warm reception and kind
hospitality they accorded us. To the KWS field staff members Sgt. James Gadam
at Baomo camp for organizing the escort and tracking team (Share Musuo and Alex
Lenguyaya), much appreciated. A big thank you is extended to the MRC staff Abio
Gafo (very knowledgeable on the flora of the area) and Jilo Hamisi (the
coxswain). A vote of thanks goes to Gordon Boy for his company, enthusiasm and
information. Finally yet importantly to Rupert Watson, I am greatly indebted to
him for his warm and cordial invitation, careful logistical planning, watchful
eye and safe driving! </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p>Happy birding always,<br></o:p></p>
