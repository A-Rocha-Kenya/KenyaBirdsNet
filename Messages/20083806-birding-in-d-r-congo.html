&gt;  Greetings 
&gt; Nairobi birders have faithfully attended the Wednesday Morning Birdwalks this year. On January 30 at the edge of the Ngong Road Forest at the Racecourse, we were fortunate to see a pair of Black-throated Wattle-eyes and a Grey Apalis in a mixed-flock feeding party. However, we were sad to see the rubbish, particularly plastic bottles, dumped by the restaurants and scattered by the baboons. 
&gt; Sunday February 3 was the Game Count in Nairobi National Park, and some of the same birders took part. Bird highlights in our sector were two pairs of Ostriches shepherding a flock of 14 half-grown “teenagers”, a Black Stork at Olmanyi Dam, four Grey Crowned Cranes near Hyena Dam and two more at Olmanyi Dam, six Black-winged Plovers where the grass has been burned and is trying to grow despite the erratic rains, and a flock of gorgeous Eurasian Bee-eaters. The Upcher’s Warbler was still feeding in the flowering acacias at the Ivory Burning site, as were a pair of Yellow-spotted Petronias; and at the gate the Red-chested Cuckoo was still crying “It will rain!!” Does it know something we don’t know? 
&gt; Wishing you good birding, Fleur
