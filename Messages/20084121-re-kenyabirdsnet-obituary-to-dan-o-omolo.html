&gt;  Dear friends, 
&gt;    
&gt;  I just received the very sad and shocking news regarding the sudden loss of Mr Dan Omondi Omolo, during a &#39;run for the fun&#39; event in Holland. 
&gt;    
&gt;  to those who didn&#39;t know Dan; Dan was one of the most active young conservationist in Kenya, who used to work at the Nature Kenya office and help on every issue from education to site support groups and  
&gt;  &#39;on the ground conservation actions&#39; across the country. Dan left during 2002 to continue with his Master degree and recently started his P.hD studdies. 
&gt;    
&gt;  It was a great privilege to meet and work with Dan during the time i lived in Kenya. He always found a way forward for un-resolved problems and always with a big smile on his face, a smile that comes alive in these very sad moments. 
&gt;    
&gt;  I would like to convey my deepest regrets and worm wishes to his family and friends in Kenya.
