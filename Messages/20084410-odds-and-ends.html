  <pre>Anyone know the name of the big pond on the right of the naivasha Road 
just after the limuru turn off? 2 weeks ago had eurasian harrier there 
and a pair of great Crested Grebes amongst the hundreds of Red knobbed 
Coots.This week there was a male Maccoa Duck and a Glossy Ibis.

In a farm above naivasha saw Malachite Sunbird (notable for us cos we 
havent seen them in 15 yeasr!) and thought that one of the the larks we 
saw was  larger and more solid than the Rufous Naped, obvious black 
spots on breast...are Red Winged larks possible there?

In my garden in Langata I watched as a very vocal male Klaas&#39; cuckoo 
fed a young cuckoo 5 times in as many minutes whilst 2 male Northern 
double collared and one male collared sunbird mobbed them noisily! 
Yellow Whiskered Greenbuls, Trogons and Black Headed Orioles are also 
very vocal just now.
