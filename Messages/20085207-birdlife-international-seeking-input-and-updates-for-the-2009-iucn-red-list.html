Hawkins in litt. to Wetlands International 2002). Given the species’s small population size it may warrant listing as Vulnerable if there is thought to be gene flow between meta-populations and hence these can be treated as a single population following the IUCN definition, or if all sub-populations support fewer
 than 1,000 individuals. Furthermore, reports suggest that conversion of wetland edge habitats for rice cultivation has been rapid. If rate of conversion is thought to have exceeded 30% over the past 14 years (or will over the next 14 years) the species could qualify as Vulnerable under criterion A. Finally, if the global population falls at the lower end of the 2002 estimate (i.e. below 2,500 mature individuals) the species may qualify as Endangered if greater than 95% of the population is restricted to a single sub-population. Comments on the population structure, likely population size and rates of decline are welcomed to help inform this assessment.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></DIV>

Population trends had not previously been quantified but were not thought to approach thresholds for listing as Near-Threatened or under a Threatened category on the IUCN Red List. However, recent review of population data by Beilfuss et al. (2007 – see attached table) suggests that populations have declined over the past 20 years by between 48.6% and 61.5%. Extrapolation of these trends over a three generation trend period of 39
 years (based upon a generation length of 12.9 years, BirdLife International unpublished data) equates to an overall population decline of 67-79% since 1969. The threshold for listing a species as Endangered on the IUCN Red List based upon past declines under criterion A2 is 50% decline over three generations. Even if declines only began after 1985 they have been sufficiently rapid (49-62%, therefore probably over 50%) to recommend listing the species as Endangered. Declines are attributed primarily to habitat loss and fragmentation and illegal removal of individuals and eggs from the wild for food, traditional use, domestication and the international illegal trade market. Grey Crowned-cranes often move from wetlands into agricultural lands to forage, exposing them to the additional threats of poisoning and collisions and electrocutions with overhead power-lines. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that declines will not continue and hence the
 species also qualifies under criteria A4 (past and future declines) over the period 1985-2024. Comments on the timing of population declines are welcome as well as further information on current and past population sizes. <BR><BR><B>Black Crowned-crane (Balearica pavonina): uplist to Vulnerable?<o:p></o:p></B></FONT></SPAN></DIV>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US"><FONT face="Times New Roman">Black Crowned-crane Balearica pavonina is currently classified as Near Threatened almost meeting criteria A2, A3 and A4 because it is suspected to have experienced a moderately rapid population decline over the past 10 years (the default trend period for the IUCN Red List). However, data from a recent comparison of population numbers from 1985, 1994 and 2004 (Beilfuss et al. 2007; see summary data attached) shows that the species may have declined by 27 - 40% since 1985 suggesting the species may qualify as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List under criterion A2. If it is sensible to extrapolate trends over a three generation trend period of 39 years (based upon a generation length of 12.9 years, BirdLife
 International unpublished data) assuming declines began prior to 1985 the species may have declined by 40 - 58% since 1969 and now has a population of 43,000-70,000 individuals. If this is the more likely scenario the species qualifies as Vulnerable on Endangered under A2 depending on whether declines equate to more or less than 50% since 1969. Beilfuss et al. (2007) cite habitat loss and fragmentation and the illegal removal of cranes from the wild for domestication or illegal international trade as pertinent continuing threats to the species. As these threats continue to impact populations similar declines may be projected into the future and the species could be listed as Vulnerable or Endangered under A4 based on declines of 40-58% from 1985 to 2024. Comments on the attached population estimates, the probable start of population declines and likely rate of future declines are welcomed as well as further information on threats to the species.

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US"><FONT face="Times New Roman">Madagascar Red Owl Tyto soumagnei is currently listed as Endangered because its global population if thought to be fewer than 2,500 individuals restricted to humid evergreen forests of north-east Madagascar. The species was recently found in the extreme south-east of Madagascar in the lowlands of Tsitongambarika. This means it is known from numerous sites along more or less the full length of the continuous rainforest belt from Tsaratanana to Fort Dauphin and across to west of the central watershed near Bealanana; isolated rainforest at Montagne d'Ambre in the extreme north; semi-evergreen forest (not rainforest) at Ankarana; and isolated rainforest on the central plateau (Kalambatritra). It has been
 recorded from sea level (Masoala) to 2000 m (Tsaratanana) and found feeding and roosting outside primary forest (slash and burn areas) on Masoala (R. Safford in litt. 2007). This new evidence suggests that the current global population estimate is too low and needs revision. If the population is considered to number between 2,500 and 10,000 individuals, the species would warrant downlisting to Vulnerable under criterion C2a(i) if all populations support fewer than 1,000 individuals. Alternatively, if the global population likely falls above 10,000 individuals or the sub-population qualifier for listing as Vulnerable is not met, the species may qualify at Near Threatened. Comments on this proposed reassessment are welcomed.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></DIV>

It is endemic to southern Africa, with two isolated populations: a large population in the arid savannas of south-east Botswana and the North West, Northern Cape and north-western Free State provinces of South Africa (with a maximum area of c.54,000 km2: Barnes 2000, over 10,000 pairs may occur in south-east Botswana: Herremans 1993), and a smaller eastern population largely restricted to the Polokwane Plateau, Limpopo province, South Africa (with a maximum area of c.10,650 km2: Barnes 2000). Engelbrecht et al. (2007) carried out surveys (21 days in total) in Sept-Oct 2004 and March 2005, covering all of the range
 of the western population falling within South Africa (29 grid squares as recorded in the Southern African Bird Atlas Project). They only found the species in two grid squares, but interviews with observers suggested that it might occur in six other squares for which there weren’t records during SABAP. For all squares, the species appears to occur at extremely low densities, or occurs seasonally/erratically, with the exception of Botsalano Nature Reserve, where c.150 terriorial males were estimated. They conclude that the species may have undergone a range contraction and population reduction, although they note that a number of the SABAP records may have represented misidentification, and they point out that the South African part of the range is on the southern and eastern limits for this population. In order to reassess the species’s global status, it is therefore important to determine the status and trends of the Botswana population.
 Information from the eastern population would also be useful. If global declines have approached 30% over ten years, then the species would warrant uplisting to Near Threatened.

It was described in 1982 and has a small range on the Jos Plateau in north Nigeria, where it is known from Panshanu, Taboru near Jos and Kagoro (Payne 1998). Its preference for undisturbed guinean savanna may make it
 susceptible to habitat loss. WWF (2001) report that the Jos Plateau has a high human population density and concomitantly expansive agricultural activity. With most of the original woodland vegetation having been lost, or restricted to inaccessible areas or river margins, this ecosystem faces a bleak future. If the global population of the species approaches 10,000 individuals, and is declining, it would warrant Near Threatened status (almost meeting criterion C1 and perhaps C2ai). In addition, if declines approach 30% in ten years/three generations, then criteria A2c and A3c may also almost be met. Further information on the status and threats to this species would be welcome. </SPAN></td></tr></table><br>
