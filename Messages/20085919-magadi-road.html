Corner Baridi was particularly cold and windy, and Olorgesailie prehistoric site was especially hot and sunny, but on average Nature Kenya&#8217;s Sunday Birdwatch was quite comfortable. Six gerenuks were feeding on the bushes near the road, and two birds with enormous white wings, seen in the distance from the waterholes, may have been bustards. <BR>
<BR>
Highlights included:<BR>
Common Kestrel eating a bird, from the bridge over the seasonal river.<BR>
Great Spotted Cuckoo and madly tail-turning Grey Wren Warbler next to the picnic banda at Olorgesailie.<BR>

Wishing you good birding, Fleur</SPAN></FONT>
