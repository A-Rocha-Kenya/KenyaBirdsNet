This observation was in Katavi NP in the SW, not the<br>Serengeti. I copy this to the observer Adam Kennedy, do ask him for details. I<br>suspect most were moving through, perhaps a regular movement and leading birds<br>had delayed due to good feeding allowing following birds to catch up and<br>congregate. However there will be a "wintering"
 population in Katavi<br>and the adjacent Rukwa Basin. Numbers<br> depending on the extent and timing of the rains and any associated<br>concentrating of prey.<br>&gt;  <br>&gt; Adam, what were they feeding on ?<br>&gt;  <br>&gt; I tried to send you our latest map for this species recently but to a diff<br>address and it bounced.

I would be very curious to know some<br>more details, as to time of day, type of landscape and the supposed food items<br>this high concentration of birds was gorging on. Did you notice anything like a<br>small mammal/ grasshopper/ locust
 outbreak that could be the reason for the<br>concentration? Were the birds hunting or were they milling above a roost?<br>&gt; Our Montagu's Harrier working group is studying the harriers in the<br>Sahel of West Africa, where we have some impressions now on their ecology (see<br>attachment). Recently, we were trying to dig up a bit more information,<br>especially on eastern Africa (where we have not been ourselves), and could not<br>find a lot. Any information is valuable to us. I find your record especially<br>interesting as Chris Magin has reported a high concentration of harriers in<br>February 2008 in Ethiopia: 2 records of large numbers of Montagu's Harriers<br>in eastern Africa within two successive seasons -<br> just a coincidence or an indication of population recovery?<br>&gt; I would be grateful if you could let me know some details on your<br>observation.<br>&gt; Thanks already and best wishes,<br>&gt; Christiane Trierweiler<br>&gt; <br>&gt;
