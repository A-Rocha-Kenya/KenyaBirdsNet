  <pre>I was going in to Mombasa last Thursday, 15th January at 7.30 a.m. and on the main 
road just the Mombasa side of Ramisi were three Abdim&#39;s Storks, they flew off in to 
the open area off the road and I had a very good view of them. This is the first time 
that I have seen Abdim&#39;s Storks down here that I can remember.
Still no sign of Spotted Flycatchers and hardly any waders!!
We also have had a Pallid Honeyguide on the bird bath a couple of times between 
Christmas and a couple of days ago. Red capped Robinchats, calling again, but not so 
frequently, and I heard the Fischers Touracos this morning. We are also getting the 
carmine beeeaters hawking overhead and over the Wasin Channel in the very early 
mornings.
