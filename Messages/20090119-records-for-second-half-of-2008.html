  <pre>A brief note to all who&#39;ve been birding in Kenya the past 6 months. I am 
compiling the list of records of interest for this period for the ABC 
Bulletin. I tend to use the Kenyabirdsnet records as a basis for most of 
what ends up in the report so please do post any records you may have 
for your area that are unusual - or if you are on safari and find 
interesting things including unusually large or small numbers of birds, 
please also jot a note about it and send it in to Kenyabirdsnet.

For records which may not be so relevant for ABC there may be others of 
interest for a report which we would like to start to publish again in 
Scopus highlighting any range extensions, early / late dates for 
migrants, rarities (local to your area and national) etc. In order to 
put together such a report, we need your records!

When sending in any records please make sure you give the DATE and 
LOCATION and if possible any comment about why you thought it was of 
interest (e.g. &#34;first time you&#39;ve seen the species in this site in 25 
years of visiting it...&#34;).

Thanks and I&#39;ll look forward to reading more records! The next report 
will be in June.
