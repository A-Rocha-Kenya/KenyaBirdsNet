It was an exciting Wednesday Morning Birdwalk at Rosslyn River Garden plant nursery and caf&eacute; in Gigiri on March 11. Highlights included a dark phase Booted Eagle with white &#8220;headlights&#8221; on the shoulders; black morph and white morph Augur Buzzards; two Common Buzzards; a pair of Cape Wagtails; two very beautiful male Beautiful Sunbirds; and Chestnut Weavers in full breeding plumage.<BR>
<BR>
There was a film crew in attendance, and the birdwalk may be featured on Citizen TV very early Monday morning March 16. Thanks to Paul Mackenzie for showing us around, and to Elly Gathungu, James Kiptoo and Kevin Gichuki for finding the birds.<BR>

Wishing you good birding, Fleur</SPAN></FONT>
