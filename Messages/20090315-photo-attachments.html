  <pre>Dear All,

this is just to remind you all that if you send a photo to the list as an attachment, please remember to re-size it to a maximum of 100kb.

sorry for the inconvenience it creates, but many of our members pay for their Internet connection per minute so i would like to try and minimise the time spent on downloading our massages.

keep these records coming though.
wish you all a great migration season.

Itai Shanni
