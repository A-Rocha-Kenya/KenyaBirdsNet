 of rainfall<BR>did not extend much beyond Impala Lookout, and whilst there had been<BR>rain it was nothing like we had received only a short distance to the<BR>west.<BR>I was through the Main Entrance at 6-30am, there was a rufous Common<BR>Buzzard perched on the drive in, and I first investigated Ivory<BR>Burning Site.<BR>Rainfall brings out the usually skulking palearctic migrants and it is<BR>difficult to know whether there was a small fall or that the birds<BR>have been present but hiding as is their usual habit. Nevertheless<BR>between here and the bushy part of the back road towards “Splash,”&nbsp; I<BR>had an adult Black Stork flying over, a dozen Nightingales, five each<BR>of Common Whitethroat and Marsh Warbler, three Garden, one Blackcap,<BR>just two Willow Warbler and two Spotted Flycatchers. A few Tree Pipits<BR>were passing overhead. There was an adult Fish Eagle at Hyena Dam, but<BR>the rallids stole the show as I sat in the car next
 to what was a reed<BR>bed and had within two metres of me Black Crakes with fluffy chicks, a<BR>few Common Moorhens with the extraordinarily confiding Lesser Moorhen,<BR>and a pair of equally extravert African Water Rails. A few Yellow<BR>Wagtails were around the edge but nothing else was seen. On the<BR>run-off were a Yellow-billed Egret, a pair of Spur-winged Geese, a few<BR>Wood and Green Sandpipers, the first three of four Whinchat, the first<BR>of four Red-tailed Shrikes and a couple of Quailfinch. In the<BR>vegetation in the basin were over 300 Barn Swallows and 100 Banded<BR>Martins.<BR>Continuing round back to Hyena Dam were a couple each of Rosy-breasted<BR>Longclaws and Red-throated Pipits. When nearly back to Ivory Burning<BR>Site I found two Levaillant’s and one diminutive black Jacobin Cuckoo<BR>in the same acacia, and an African Firefinch gathering nesting<BR>material from the road. All Nagalomon Dam could muster were a few each<BR>of
 Wood and Green Sandpipers and a Common Buzzard. Driving up and<BR>through part of Kisembe Forest there were singles Namaqua Dove,<BR>Eurasian Bee-eater and Nairobi Pipit, and towards Kingfisher a young<BR>Eurasian Roller. The swamp near Kingfisher held an adult Black Stork,<BR>possibly the bird seen earlier in the morning, and five each of<BR>Northern and Isabelline and two Pied Wheatears. On returning across<BR>the plains were three Common Kestrels and I left towards the Langata<BR>Gate via the Kisembe River valley (parallel to Magadi Road) nearly<BR>running over the tail of one of a pair of honeymooning Lions at the<BR>edge of the forest in a most unexpected place.&nbsp; The warbler drinking<BR>pond that I described here back in April is starting to hold water<BR>again and might entice thirsty birds during the heat of the day. I<BR>left at 2-30pm having only investigated the northern part of the Park.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>LAKE NAKURU NATONAL
 PARK 15TH December 2009<BR><BR>On 15th December 2009, I escorted Mike Davidson, Fleur Ng’Weno and<BR>Karen Plumbe up to Lake Nakuru. The idea being to relocate the Fox<BR>Kestrels that Nigel Hunter and I found ten days before.<BR>On the way a small flooded grassland that has ironically not been wet<BR>for over ten years and yet next to the disappearing Lake Elementeita<BR>at Kikopey was an interesting diversion. Three Open-billed Storks<BR>rested in the trees, a single Garganey was in the shallows<BR>accompanying a Black-tailed Godwit, Spotted Redshank and Temminck’s<BR>Stint amongst the more usual Wood and Marsh Sandpipers, fifty Ruff and<BR>a Greenshank. There were a scattering of Yellow Wagtails of the race<BR>lutea, and a couple of Sand Martins. With the current conditions this<BR>area of temporary wetland must prove a magnet for birds moving down<BR>the Rift, and should equally cause any passing birders to pause.<BR>At Nakuru the lake falls,
 and there appears nothing but Lesser<BR>Flamingos on it. We readily located the four Fox Kestrels and it was a<BR>new bird for Mike, Fleur and Karen. There were some four Common but<BR>only two Lesser Kestrels. There seem to be either more Common Kestrels<BR>than usual, or they are usually masked by the abundance of Lessers and<BR>this year so far it has been very poor for Lessers in Kenya. There was<BR>a very broad-winged, short tailed Aquila flying over but this will<BR>have to be investigated. The African race of Eurasian Hoopoe (wabeli)<BR>was at the Lanet Entrance. Very happily five White-fronted Bee-eaters<BR>were busily excavating burrows at the Makalia Falls camp-site, and<BR>displaying around the nest hole. Hopefully more will come and join<BR>them. We had a pair of Pale Flycatchers below Lion Hill, and as with<BR>ten days ago, no-one can remember them being in Nakuru before. Also<BR>here there were a pair of Southern Ground-Hornbills and a
 very smart<BR>“curly-crested” Helmet-shrike. Migrants were poor although wheatears<BR>were numerous away from the Lake. We finished up with a dozy Leopard<BR>on the way out.<BR><BR>Best to all,<BR>Brian<BR></DIV><!-- cg25.c2.mail.re1.yahoo.com compressed/chunked Tue Dec  8 00:42:11 PST 2009 --></div></body></html>
