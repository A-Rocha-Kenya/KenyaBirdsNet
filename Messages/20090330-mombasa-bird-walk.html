<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>A walk to the wetland, this time on the outside of 
the fence of Nguuni Wildlife Sanctuary, to catch the last of the water which is 
drying up fast.&nbsp; Weaver activity in the surrounding area seemed manic, 
mostly Golden Palm and Village,&nbsp;nearly all&nbsp;carrying nesting 
material.&nbsp; A group of Crested Francolins in the grassland, Carmine 
Bee-eaters on the wires.&nbsp; Wetland fairly active but no sign of Pelicans, 
seen last time.&nbsp;One African&nbsp;Spoonbill still around and a big group of 
Yellow Billed Storks.&nbsp; About 6 Fulvous Ducks, not so common in this area, 
Little Grebes in the water.&nbsp; Am told they are the most sensitive to 
pollution so good to know the water is not polluted, 'yet' anyway! Not many 
migrants, a few Barn Swallows dipping and diving, a couple of Wood Sandpipers, 2 
or 3 Spotted Flycatchers in the acacias but a very large and varied group of 
Yellow Wagtails round the edge of the lake and in the trees, looking as though 
they are congregating ready&nbsp;to leave.&nbsp; A beautiful Goliath Heron, one 
Intermediate Egret and lots of Red Billed Queleas coming to roost in the reed 
beds as we left.&nbsp; 36 species in all.&nbsp;Last job was checking on the 
Verreaux Eagle Owl, in the cage at the gate to see how well he is growing.&nbsp; 
He cooed gently at us and blinked his pink eyelids.&nbsp; Birding is very good 
just now, lots of Eurasian Golden Orioles still around Tudor Creek, a real 
joy!&nbsp;&nbsp; Join us if you are in Mombasa.&nbsp; (Marlene Reid -
