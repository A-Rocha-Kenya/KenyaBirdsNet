  <pre>Hi Fleur and all,

this is a very interesting record of the Yellowbill, especially when it comes after Brian&#39;s record of another intra-african migrant at NNP - Thick-billed Cuckoo from the 3rd of May.

i wonder how many of these intra-african do we really get around Nbi and whether there is a distinct migration pattern that we&#39;re missing?!

Itai

&gt; Greetings
&gt; 
&gt; Nature Kenya¹s Wednesday morning birdwalk had another delightful outing at
&gt; Windsor Golf and Country Club today 6th May. Craibia brownii trees
&gt; throughout the remnant forest were piled high with clusters of
&gt; honey-scented, rosy-white blossoms. African Darter on the pond, Brown-backed
&gt; Scrub Robin in the forest, and African Golden Weavers nesting on the island
&gt; in the pond.
&gt; 
&gt; The surprise was a big bird with blue-green plumage, long tail and long
&gt; yellow beak ­ a Yellowbill (aka Green Coucal or Green Malkoha). This bird is
&gt; mainly found on the coast and in the western forests, and only occasionally
&gt; passes through Nairobi.
&gt; 
&gt; Wishing you good birding, Fleur
&gt;
