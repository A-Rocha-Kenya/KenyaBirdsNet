  <pre>By the ponds at hillcrest on the wednesday morning bird walk 23rd april we had some great sightings of African spoonbill on their tree roost with Black crowned night herons below. Litle Rush Warbler were singing and there were good sightings of the Great Reed Warbler and Red faced Cisticola. Red Billed Quelea, White Winged Widowbirds and a couple of Grey Backed Shrikes were in the grassland. Stopping for a coffee when the group had gone we had an Osprey fly overhead. 

After the rain last week there was an immature African Goshawk termiting in our garden in Langata. The Common Buzzard was last seen 2 weeks ago. A Crowned eagle has been heard overhead in the last week and round the corner there was a Great Sparrowhawk closely following Black Duck down the Mbagathi. Mountain Wagtail were on the river.  Lemon Dove and Tambourine Dove were in the forest above the Mbagathi, as were Black Collared Apalis. Eurasian Beeeaters were still passing over last week and we saw one European Roller fly high overhead.

In a short visit to the park a couple of days ago we had the Madagascar Squacco Heron in the dam by the forest. There was a Black and White Cuckoo and we had a short glimpse of what looked like a a Spotted Morning Warbler in scrub by a river. we only saw it from the back but this bird had the end of its tail black (no white). Of the migrants only a few Barn swallows and 2 shrikes (one a Red- backed and the other an unidentified immature).
