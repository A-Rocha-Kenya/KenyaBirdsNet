  <hr/>
  <pre>Dear Birders,
I have been in Nairobi for 18 months and with the aid of 4 texts I can usually identify most of what I see. Some things puzzle me though and I&#39;d be very grateful for help in identifying half a dozen pictures. In most cases I have it down to one of two in my own mind but for various reasons the books don&#39;t help. &#34;lighter than...&#34; isn&#39;t obvious unless you have seen both!
The pics are at http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/townfurze  under the title Mystery Birds.
I&#39;m sure some of you will wonder what the mystery is, and I look forward to your help.

Best wishes,
David
