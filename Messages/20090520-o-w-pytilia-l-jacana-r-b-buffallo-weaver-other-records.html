Dear&nbsp; all<br>
On a fast birding trip with Govind Kumar from Dubai had some good
selection of migrants including Barn Swallows at Lake Naivasha, Nakuru,
Molo, Kisumu and Mara. 1 individual <b>Eurasian Roller</b> in Lake
Nakuru, Govind and Vivek saw a single adult male <b>Amur Falcon</b> fly
by the Lake Nakuru Lodge on 4th of July. We had a single <b>Lesser Jacana
</b>on the wetland past Timboroa on the 5th of july also the same dam
were the <b>Hunter's</b> and <b>Levaillant's Cisticola</b>s, Same day the
Molo Grasslands produce <b>Hunter's</b> and <b>Aberdare Cisticola</b>s,
<b>Wattled Plover, Sharpe's Longclaw, Cape Wagtail<br>
</b>Other interesting birds included 2 <b>Compact Weaver</b>s at the Sio
River on the 6th of July. The bird of the trip must have been the
<b>Orange-winged Pytilia</b>; a single individual on the hill behind the
Sarova Mara Tented Camp feeding along the road and flying past the van on
the 9th of July. This seems the first record for Masai Mara National
Reserve and that west for Kenya.<br><br>
Then in Brian's Nairobi National Farm (the herds of cattle are back and
we encountered 4 large herds of over 50 plus 2 dead way up on the
Embakasi plains) with Oscar Campbell on a very chilly day on 17th of
July, we encountered a flock of about 15 <b>Red-billed
Bufallo-Weaver</b>s which included 5 males and all together feeding with
the Superb Starling. This species is known below 1500mASL and is species
recorded last before 1972 for the park and Nairobi. <br>
There is also a giraffe kill or carcass near the Kingfisher Picnic Site
which had attracted 21 <b>Ruppell's Griffon</b> and 70 <b>African
White-backed Vulture</b>s, 1 <b>Palm-nut Vulture</b> between the Hippo
Pools and Athi Dam, a single <b>Lizard Buzzard</b> at the Kisembe Forest
and behind the Kingfisher Picnic Site (not sure if the same or 2
individual) , a Giant Kingfisher before the Masai Lodge turnoff on along
the tiny river. 1 <b>Abyssinian Scimitarbill </b>at the Hippo Pool, over
30 <b>Banded Martin</b>s, one <b>African Firefinch</b> at the Hippo
Pool.<br><br>
18th of July in <b>GATAMAIYU FOREST</b> had a sit hide out in the dark
forest in search of the Bar-tailed Trogon which never turned up nor hoot
but instead the <b>Brown-chested Alethe</b> and later a single
<b>Abyssinian Ground Thrush</b> turned up. and so calm they came feeding
less than 3 meters from our sit and enjoyed their presence for about 20
min. Limuru Ponds had 2 <b>Malachite Sunbird</b>s<br><br>
cheers and good birding<br>
