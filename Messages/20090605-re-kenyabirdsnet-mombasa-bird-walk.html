&gt;  Dear Birders, 
&gt;    
&gt;  A bit late with my news of Msa birdwalk this 
&gt; month. 
&gt;    
&gt;  We went to big brand new golf complex at Vipingo 
&gt; Ridge.  It rained for the whole walk which the birds seemed to appreciate 
&gt; less than we did with the exception of the White Browed Robin Chats which were 
&gt; singing their hearts out in great numbers.  Not many special birds but 
&gt; the Lizard Buzzard who sat just a few feet away from us at eye level on a 
&gt; spindly tree was pretty good.  Difficult to get a better view and a delight 
&gt; to some of the birders who had only seen one from afar.  Interesting to see 
&gt; many Barn Swallows and Eurasian Golden Orioles still around. Pintail Whydahs in 
&gt; large numbers, males flaunting their long tails.  This is a magnificent 
&gt; site, 2500 acres and am convinced that it is a very good potential bird watching 
&gt; area once the development settles down.  Views both over the ocean and the 
&gt; sea are magnificent and it is several degrees cooler than Mombasa, a blessing in 
&gt; itself for both birds and man.  Carry on birding.  Marlene Reid
