  <pre>Good afternoon

A quick visit to the sukari dam yesterday evening around 6pm found many of the birds mentioned in Fleur&#39;s recent email following her Wednesday bird walk trip to Ruiru, though not in huge numbers. Interesting additions yesterday were 7 greater flamingoes who seemed very happy working the water, and 3 or 4 ruffs.  Two hippos were happily in the middle of a large group of white faced whistling ducks.

Kind regards
Tracy Pallister
