<BR>
A brief drive through Nairobi National in the heat of midday on 12 September recorded the following:<BR>
<BR>
At least 27 vultures feeding at a decomposing carcass below Hyena Dam, including 2 R&uuml;ppell&#8217;s Griffon Vultures and the rest White-backed Vultures.<BR>
A well-fed Martial Eagle in the forest.<BR>
A Bateleur flying below Impala lookout<BR>
A gorgeous female Saddle-billed Stork feeding where the outflow from Hyena Dam crosses the road<BR>
<BR>
Later in the day, just after 5 pm, there was a real, if brief, shower of rain, and Helmeted Guineafowl quenched their thirst in the puddles in the road.<BR>
<BR>
With best wishes from Fleur and Catherine of Nature Kenya<BR>
