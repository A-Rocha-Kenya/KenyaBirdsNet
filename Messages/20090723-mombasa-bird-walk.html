<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dear Birders,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Vipingo Quarries near Kijipwe air field to see the 
last of the migrant waders:</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Little Stint, Common Sandpiper,&nbsp;Greenshank, 
Curlew Sandpiper, Wood Sandpiper and Ringed Plover, all still present but not in 
large numbers.&nbsp; Lots of Barn Swallows swooping overhead.&nbsp; Non-migrants 
of interest: African Fish Eagle adult followed by a calling juvenile.&nbsp; Some 
Ethiopian Swallows, a beautiful Intermediate Egret and some lovely Three Banded 
Plovers.&nbsp; This area is now quarried out, as the water table has been 
reached so plenty of ponds and amazing vegetation which already has lots of 
nesting weavers, queleas and seed-eaters taking up residence.&nbsp; Should be an 
impressive place eventually, unfortunately all the trees being planted are for 
bio-fuel, fast growing species and by no means permanent.&nbsp; Hopefully 
indigenous trees will grown up around them.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Nguuni Sanctuary:&nbsp; Mombasa</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Walk with Kevin Mazera, Carissa and Peter 
Nightingale and Alka Subharao.&nbsp; Big shock finding entrance fee hiked 
250%&nbsp; i.e. entrance 300. bird walk 200, guide 200.&nbsp; So watch out if 
you come to Mombasa and go birding at Nguuni!</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The area is still very dry but there has been some 
rain and the wetland is still quite wet.&nbsp; Being dry everywhere else all 
birds were centred here.&nbsp; Three magnificent African Darters, 3 Pink Backed 
Pelican, 1 Woolly Necked and lots of Yellow Billed Storks, 1 Intermediate Egret, 
1 Great white Egret, Grey, Black Headed and a couple of Purple Heron, 2 Spur 
Winged Plover, 2 Water Dikkops,&nbsp; lots of White Faced Whistling Ducks, 2 
Allen's Gallinule, Common Moorhens, African Black Crake, and African 
Jacana.&nbsp; Migrants: Several Wood Sandpiper, a marvellous Marsh Sandpiper 
(not seen here for ages) Madagascar Bee-Eaters, plenty of Barn Swallows catching 
insects on the ponds and a big group of Yellow Wagtails around the edge of the 
pond and in the surrounding bush. Other special birds to see: 2 male African 
Paradise Flycatchers, both white phase and with half-grown tails, Scarlet 
Chested Sunbirds (a pair) a single male Violet Backed Starling, Northern 
Brownbuls, Malachite and Mangrove Kingfisher, Village Weavers (mostly males) and 
on the way back through the Acacia woodland an Eastern Bearded Scrub Robin, 
never seen by me in this area before.&nbsp; In two and a half hours 52 species 
which is pretty good I think!&nbsp;&nbsp; Pity&nbsp;Nguuni has priced itself out 
of the market for most of the local birders!&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Still some Eurasian Orioles on Tudor 
Creek.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Keep on birding, welcome to Mombasa Bird Walk every 
3rd Saturday in the month but call re: time for meeting as we are having to go 
further afield and sometimes meet earlier than previously.&nbsp; (Marlene Reid
