Individuals certainly arrive in Kenya in July: I find my first "autumn" record is of one bird on 8 July at Naivasha in 1972 but most of my July records are from 20th onwards.</span></font></div><div><br></div><div><div>Britton (Birds of East Africa, 1980) and Zimmerman et al.

(The Birds of Africa vol 2, 1986) also note, "1st adults penetrate south of the equator by mid-July", so the species' early arrival is well documented.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br></div><div>Further, Chapin (Birds of the Belgian Congo, vol 2, 1939) writes (of the Belgian Congo, now DRC), "The astonishingly early arrival of birds from the north has often led to the assumption that they have bred near the equator." He goes on to give July (from 21st) and August records down to 7Â° S. His remarks make it quite clear, though, that he does not think much of the claims that it has bred in tropical Africa,&nbsp;"Of its nesting in tropical Africa I am still skeptical. The van Somerens have published a photograph taken in Uganda of a bird supposedly sitting on its nest, and Colonel Meinertzhagen, too, reported young common sandpipers with their parents on the Kagiado River in Kenya Colony."&nbsp;Well, now we all know about Col Meinertzhagen and his records . . .</div><div><br></div><div>Many northbound Common Sandpipers caught for ringing in early May carried a lot of fat.</div><div><br></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 15px; ">Best wishes,</span></div><div><br></div><div>Graeme Backhurst</div></body></html>
