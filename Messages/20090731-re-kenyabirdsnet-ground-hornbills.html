  <pre>Hi all,
Ground hornbills in laikipia? i&#39;ve not seen there. i&#39;ve spent time in bobong and at lewa i&#39;ve never seen them, if there&#39;s any record i&#39;d like to know where!.

on a different note i would like congratulate the KWS for getting the leadership and  governance practises awards in recently concluded COYA AWARDs, thumbs up to KWS. i&#39;ve seen kws offer transport and acommodation during waterfowl census every year. 

best regards.

&gt;  Hi James, 
&gt;    
&gt;  I have been living much of the time in Laikipia for the 
&gt; past ca. 8 years...mostly on Ol Pejeta Conservancy and now on Soita Nyiro 
&gt; Conservancy. ...as you know.  I do not recall ever coming across ground 
&gt; hornbills anywhere in Laikipia.  
&gt;    
&gt;  I am copying this to Drs. Margaret Kinnaird and Tim 
&gt; O&#39;Brian of Mpala Research Centre...as they have a particular interest in 
&gt; hornbills and have been at that site for a few years now.  I met with them 
&gt; recently and recall them saying that they had now recorded four species of 
&gt; hornbills on Mpala ... but I do not recall that the ground hornbill was 
&gt; among them. 
&gt;    
&gt;  I am also copying this email to James Culverwell.. .who can put you into 
&gt; contact with the &#39;ground hornbill people of South Africa&#39;. 
&gt;    
&gt;  Regards, 
&gt;

&gt;   Dear 
&gt;   All, A few quick question: Are there any Ground Hornbills left in Laikipia? 
&gt;   Has anyone ever read about reintroductions of Ground Hornbills?  What 
&gt;   would exactly would have been the chief cause of extirpation of Ground 
&gt;   Hornbills from Laikipia if they have indeed been extirpated?  Where were 
&gt;   they once common in the area? Thanks for your ideas. Cheers, James
