  <pre>many thanks Onesmo, another great obs.

this is early, we have excellent data from Henning Grossman in Moshi who 
monitored a nest at KCMC for many years. I&#39;ll dig this out and repost it.

I recall an early nest in the East Usambaras that suggested to me that birds 
closer to the equator might not move as far as birds at breeding at higher 
latitudes.

Nobby, what data for the EU ?

I recall Oct is the displaying month close to Dar, must send out a new map.

ANOTHER MIGRANT TO BE AWARE OF AND TO SEND IN ALL RECORDS.

let&#39;s see what we can all put together on the movements of this bird.

It&#39;s known to migrate &#34;in numbers&#34; through the Western Rift along Lake 
Tanganyika. I&#39;ll look for the refs, Sept I think is the best month.

Some excellent sat tagging work on birds breeding in Namibia and moving 
north to Nigeria during their OFF season. again I&#39;ll look for the refs.

Lizanne, please post to the Zambia and Malawi groups.

look out for displaying and soaring birds, they become far more elusive once 
they are on eggs.

Neil

&gt; Hi,Neil.
&gt; The first one this season.
&gt; A pair of Wahlbergs Eagles have been nesting around the camp for more
&gt; than four years.
&gt; They go and come back on the same nest
&gt; According to my obs. they are early this season.
&gt; They arrived today and i saw one carrying building material.
