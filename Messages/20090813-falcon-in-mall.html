<BR>
Pulling into the parking lot between the high-rise buildings of Yaya Centre on August 12, I saw a large falcon, likely a Peregrine, carrying a large item of prey. It flew onto one of the platforms in the stairwell of one of the high-rises, which seems to be unfinished. Although I peered from the Nairobi Sports House window upstairs, I could not see far enough into the stairwell to see the falcon again.<BR>
<BR>
Keep looking if you go shopping!<BR>

Wishing you good birding, Fleur</SPAN></FONT>
