  <pre>15/8/09 Birding at Mida Creek this morning turned up the first Little 
Stint I&#39;ve seen for the season here - 16 birds. Also a single 
Sanderling, also my first. Curlew Sands with quite a lot of remains of 
their beautiful &#39;brick red&#39; breeding plumage also feeding furiously but 
overall wader numbers still quite low. The mangroves and bush along the 
edge were quite active with some stunning African Golden Orioles and a 
feeding flock of Lesser Masked Weavers and bulbuls had three female / 
juv Black Cuckoo-Shrikes which were foraging sometimes on the ground 
which I&#39;ve not seen very often. African Harrier Hawk, a pair of Great 
Sparrowhawks, a family of Yellow-throated Longclaws, Yellowbill, a 
Woolly-necked Stork overhead and a pair of Pale Batis in the mangroves 
by the A Rocha Kenya boardwalk all added to the morning. As we left the 
site and turned onto the main tarmac road we had four Bohm&#39;s Spinetails 
and a Mottled Spinetail over the forest opposite the Mida turning - a 
spot I&#39;ve often had them.

Yesterday just near Gede junction I had an Ayre&#39;s Hawk Eagle over the 
main road and 10 days ago (6th) as we were doing a crow survey in 
Malindi we had very good views of Bat Hawk chasing the bats as they came 
out of roost.
