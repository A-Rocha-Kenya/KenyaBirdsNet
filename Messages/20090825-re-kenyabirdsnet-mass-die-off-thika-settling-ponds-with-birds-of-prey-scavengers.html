<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>July 3-5 this year I visited Mwea Irrigation for 
three days. I saw only a few raptors and one of them was sick. Normally you will 
see many of them. As far as other birds were concerned they were also very few 
compared with April and May of this year. I wondered whether this was caused by 
'spraying'. Anyone with information on this issue?</FONT></DIV>

  <P>On 24th August, Richard and Ann Bishop, Andrew Kamiti, Chege 
  Karuki,<BR>Itai Shanni, Daniel Vaknin and myself visited Thika Settling 
  Ponds.<BR><BR>We were horrified to see hundreds to dead and dying birds around 
  the<BR>ponds that either had been stricken by a virus or a poison. 
  There<BR>could have been thousands of dead birds under the water and 
  floating<BR>vegetation.<BR><BR>Raptors would find these weak birds very easy 
  pickings, and we found a<BR>Civet midden conaining a large amount of feathers, 
  so mammals may also<BR>be affected.<BR><BR>Spur-winged Plovers seemed to be 
  very seriously hit, but also<BR>Black-winged Stilts, Curlew Sandpipers, Ruffs 
  (including a male with a<BR>well developed ruff), were also scattered around. 
  There could have<BR>been many waders amongst the debris that were nearly 
  submerged, wings<BR>were scattered throughout along the banks. Many waders 
  were showing<BR>signs of weakness.. There were eighty Little Stint, six 
  Curlew<BR>Sandpipers, twenty Ruff, seventy Wood, three Green, fifteen Common 
  and<BR>one Marsh Sandpipers present. Additionally far less live 
  Spur-winged<BR>Plovers than dead ones, a couple of Long-toed Plovers, six 
  Blacksmith<BR>and fifteen Three-banded Plovers. Probably several hundred 
  Stilts. All<BR>are potentially already affected. There was only one 
  White-winged<BR>Black Tern.<BR><BR>Like some waders, Hadada Ibis were unable 
  to fly and appeared<BR>paralysed, and there were carcasses of Sacred 
  Ibis.<BR><BR>Huge numbers of ducks were floating on the surface 
  affecting<BR>Yellow-billed Duck, Red-billed and Hottentot Teal. The banks 
  were<BR>strewn with Coot carcasses that appeared violently contorted. 
  Large<BR>numbers of grebes were sitting on the edge of the ponds, and a 
  few<BR>were floating on the water. There were good numbers of ducks 
  which<BR>also included a pair of White-backed, White-faced Whistling-Duck 
  and<BR>Egyptian Goose. There were many Plain Martins and one sick 
  bird<BR>fluttering in vain on the surface of the water. It isn't known as 
  to<BR>how many small birds were dead amongst the tall grass along the 
  banks,<BR>as out visit was too short to enable anything but a cursory look, 
  but<BR>what we saw horrified us.<BR><BR>This broad spectrum mass die off 
  should be investigated immediately to<BR>determine whether it represents 
  something horrific like Avian Flu, or<BR>that poisons are getting into this 
  water system. The urgency cannot be<BR>stressed enough.<BR><BR></P></DIV><!--End group email --></BODY></HTML>
