  <pre>Dear all,

thanks to Brian for submitting this report and for the Dept. of Ornithology at the National Museums that followed it up with a survey.
i hope that soon we will hear the results of the PM from the samples that were collected by the DoO team.

i stress all birders out there to be alert and let us know of any unusual concentration of dead birds (usually next to water).

Itai
