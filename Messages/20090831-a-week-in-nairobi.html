  <pre>At home on Koitobos Road the baby Great Sparrowhawk sits whining for food at all hours of the day and the Yellow Whiskered Greenbuls are calling incessantly. Little Sparrowhawk have been seen twice.Vereax eagle Owls were heard again one night last week but not seen. A Tambourine Dove ambled across the lawn.
A family of 4 Brown Parisomas were in a garden on Bogani Road.
In the park yesterday the chick (might be two but not easy to see) in the Martials Eagles nest is huge, white and downey.
The heads of 2 spur wing geese were in the Hyena Dam..I guess their bodies were there as well, under the weed. 2 yellow billed egret and 2 Lilac Breasted Rollers.
At Windsor Golf Course on Friday there were thick billed Seedeaters, Zanzibar Sombre Greenbuls and a white morph male Paradise Flycatcher. IN the UN compound a Darter, 2 Common Sandpipers, Violet Backed starlings,  a Crowned Eagle calling over the forest and a flock of over 100 Plain Martins.
