<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dear Birders,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>After the success of the early morning walk to 
Nguuni I decided that we should visit the wetland while the level of the water 
is conducive to the many birds being there due to the enlarged wading 
space.&nbsp; Luckily it can be approached from the Lafarge land thus avoiding 
the Nguuni entry fee.&nbsp; It would have been too much to hope that all the 
species seen on the Tuesday were still there but overall&nbsp;the birds were 
very obliging!</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The pond on the way up to the wetland had lots of 
Grosbeak Weavers but the African Golden Weavers that had seemed to be nesting 
last time we visited were nowhere to be seen.&nbsp; Pity!&nbsp; Water in the 
pond pretty low but lots of waterlilies with African Black Crakes (a couple of 
young ones as well) and African Jacanas.&nbsp; A Green-Backed Heron flying off 
and Red Billed Firefinch in the bush.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Wetland seems to have certain of the large birds 
around in the afternoon rather than the morning.&nbsp; Yellow Billed 
Storks,&nbsp;a pair of adult Purple Herons&nbsp;collecting grass fronds and 
taking them into the thick reeds so maybe nesting, and 6 African 
Spoonbills.&nbsp; Lots of Sacred Ibis, a single Great White Egret and 2 Little 
Egrets.&nbsp; Allen's Gallinules several around mostly on the grassy islands and 
a single Purple Swamphen seen just as we were leaving.&nbsp; Great Painted 
Snipe&nbsp; with a male this time, again easily seen feeding and preening out in 
the open.&nbsp; The Knob-billed Duck swimming and then waddling around the 
grass,&nbsp;knob about half grown,&nbsp;no female in sight. MIgrants biggest 
group now Greenshank, a couple of Common Sand and still the solitary Marsh and 
one Little Stint. Common Waxbills in the bush and flying up off the path on the 
journey back to the car a Slender-tailed nightjar.&nbsp; The grassland opposite 
the wetland was full of Zanzibar Red Bishops and Bronze mannikins. A large flock 
of White Faced Whistling Ducks flew in to roost as the sun disappeared below the 
horizon. Disappointing not to see the Pygmy Goose but then that's 
birds!</FONT></DIV>
