It was a fabulous morning for Nature Kenya's Wednesday Morning Birdwalk at Sukari Dam, Gicheha Farm, Brookside Dairies on September 23.<BR>
<BR>
One clump of papyrus produced Black Crake, Common Moorhen, two African Water Rails and ....a beautiful Baillon&#8217;s Crake, found by Peter Wairasho and Kevin Gichuki. It was nine years almost to the day that I had first seen it at the same place.<BR>
<BR>
On the main dam, now dredged to eliminate the water hyacinth, there were numbers of waterbirds, including seven Greater Flamingo (5 adults, 1 sub-adult and 1 immature), three pairs of Southern Pochard, a pair of Blacksmith Plovers with four tiny chicks, a Black-tailed Godwit and a Common Greenshank, two Whiskered Terns and two hippos. In the reedy diversion channel there were all four egrets and three ibises, and various plovers, sandpipers and warblers.<BR>
<BR>
Birding groups who would like to arrange a visit can contact Fred Mungai Muiruri at Brookside Dairies &lt;<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><U>fred.mungai@brookside.co.ke</U></FONT>&gt; <BR>

Wishing you good birding, Fleur</SPAN></FONT>
