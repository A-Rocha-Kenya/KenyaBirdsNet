  <P>On the 20th September, Nigel Hunter and myself decided that we 
  would<BR>investigate the forest along the descent road between Limuru and 
  Mai<BR>Maahiu. We stopped first along a track that went off on the left 
  about<BR>a kilometre before the tourist dukas. In this initial walk at 
  an<BR>elevation of what we estimated over 2200 metres we found about 
  seven<BR>Blue-capped Cordon-bleus scattered in pairs and singles through 
  the<BR>bush. The fact that it was multiple encounters makes one wonder if 
  it<BR>is vagrancy from lower altitudes escaping the drought, or are 
  they<BR>regularly at this location. Red-cheeked were not encountered at 
  all.<BR>Are there any other records from as high an elevation as this? 
  Other<BR>species seen here were a pair of Red-throated Wrynecks, 
  Malachite<BR>Sunbirds feeding on the Leonotis, Cinnamon Bracken Warblers 
  and<BR>Hunter's Cisticolas were numerous. On the other side of the 
  road<BR>(right) there was a dirt road that climbed up towards the ridge. 
  Here<BR>we found a party of twelve Eurasian Bee-eaters, Moustached 
  Green<BR>Tinkerbird, Mountain Yellow Warbler, Golden-winged and 
  Eastern<BR>Double-collared Sunbirds.<BR>On the other side of the dukas we 
  followed the Mayer's Road checking<BR>the riparian scrub along the creek. The 
  most surprising thing here<BR>were the several singing Brown Woodland 
  Warblers, seeing Blue-capped<BR>Cordon-bleus at an estimated 1200 feet higher 
  than Brown Woodland<BR>Warbler seemed just wrong! As so little is known about 
  this area as<BR>the tendency is just to use the road to get to the Mara or 
  Naivasha, I<BR>have listed the species that we recordedÂ….<BR><BR>Above the

  Weaver,<BR>Yellow Bishop, Purple Grenadier, Red-billed Firefinch. African 
  Citril,<BR>Reichenow's Seedeater, Golden-breasted Bunting.<BR><BR>We took the 
  Kijabe Road to the top of the escarpment, and had a look<BR>at Manguo Pond, 
  and the new raised walkway for birders, now it has<BR>become a fenced in bird 
  sanctuary. The water level was very low and<BR>there were hardly any waterfowl 
  and the only migrant waders were a few<BR>Common Sandpipers. There were over 
  half-a-dozen Yellow Wagtails<BR>already, and a Eurasian Black Kite in the 
  area. The nearby sewage pond<BR>had some twenty Glossy Ibis, a nice pair of 
  resident watchful<BR>Peregrines in a dead tree, but little else.<BR><BR>It 
  made for an interesting circuit, and the escarpment forest is well<BR>worthy 
  of investigation. There was a Grey Duiker crossing a track, and<BR>Leopard 
  tracks along a road from the night before.<BR><BR>NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 21st 
  SEPTEMBER 2009<BR>EURASIAN CUCKOO, NORTHERN AND ISABELLINE WHEATEAR, SAND 
  MARTIN, BARN SWALLOW<BR><BR>Today 21st September, Mike and Louisa Davidson, 
  Karen Plumbe and<BR>myself had a day in Nairobi National Park. Being a holiday 
  weekend,<BR>there was an amazing number of people in the Park, with 
  visitors<BR>entering from as early as 6-15am (when we arrived).<BR>The Park 
  had seen nothing of the recent rain that had fallen in the<BR>city and 
  Karen/Lavington.<BR>Our first stop was Ivory Burning Site where there was a 
  couple of<BR>White Rhinos and a good variety of birds but nothing out of 
  the<BR>ordinary. Roosting birds were leaving the reedbed on Nagalomon 
  Dam,<BR>and flocks of Grosbeak Weavers, Black Saw-wings and Plain Martins 
  were<BR>flying past. There was nothing also up to the back of Hyena Dam, 
  where<BR>the small swamp had a female Northern Wheatear and a party of 
  Zebra<BR>Waxbills which looked like a family group with several immatures 
  with<BR>an adult pair. At Hyena Dam there was a calling African Water Rail 
  and<BR>one of only two Lilac-breasted Rollers seen today. On the run-off 
  were<BR>two Yellow-billed and one Great Egret, and on the plains an Oribi 
  with<BR>a very tattered ear, a few Wattled Starlings and a few distant 
  Athi<BR>Short-toed Larks, plus another family of Zebra Waxbills but very 
  few<BR>Quailfinch. At Karen Primary School Dam there were two 
  Yellow-throated<BR>Sandgrouse. Whilst there was nothing at Embakasi Dam, there 
  was a<BR>Steinbok on the way, and the first Isabelline Wheatear of the 
  season.<BR>Towards the Athi Basin there were over a hundred very noisy 
  Athi<BR>Short-toed Larks, three White-tailed Larks, ten Red-capped Larks and 
  a<BR>number of Fischer's Sparrowlarks (and plenty of Rufous-naped Larks 
  of<BR>course). Near Athi Dam was another flock of over a hundred 
  Athi<BR>Short-toed Larks, whilst at the dam three White Pelicans, three 
  adult<BR>Black-crowned Night-Herons, ten Black-winged Stilts, a pair 
  of<BR>Spur-winged Plovers and migrant waders consisted of one Wood, 
  four<BR>Common, two Marsh Sandpipers and four Little Stints. The first 
  Sand<BR>Martin accompanied a party of Barn Swallows. The water-level 
  is<BR>dropping fast. Stopping for lunch along the Mbagathi River on 
  the<BR>Rhino Circuit, we were staggered to find an immature Eurasian 
  Cuckoo<BR>which stayed with us for the hour we were there. This is an 
  incredibly<BR>early date for this species, all the more remarkable with the 
  bird<BR>being an immature. The only other bird of any note was a 
  Green<BR>Sandpiper. There was little all the way to Kingfisher Picnic 
  Site<BR>where there was a Saddle-billed Stork on the little swamp, and 
  two<BR>Bohor Reedbuck amongst the numbers and variety of other game 
  animals<BR>that included another pair of White Rhinos. Calling in at 
  Nagalomon<BR>Dam there was a Great Cormorant and a pair of very nice 
  Egyptian<BR>Mongooses. Just before reaching the Main Entrance Gate at 
  5-00pm,<BR>there was a Suni along the road. A remarkable day for the 
  smaller<BR>antelope species. There were Barn Swallows met with several 
  times<BR>during the day, but Banded Martins were seen all through the Park 
  all<BR>day, though no flocks. Cinnamon-chested Rock-Buntings were seen 
  a<BR>number of times including one party of eight with the brightest male 
  I<BR>have ever seen.<BR>The cattle abound in the southern parts of the Park, 
  sadly also large<BR>numbers of Goats and Sheep. It's out of hand again. Of the 
  native<BR>mammals, they were in impressive numbers virtually throughout 
  the<BR>Park.<BR>There seems to be an earlier arrival of migrants than usual, 
  we shall<BR>have to see if this trend continues during the rest of the month 
  and<BR>into October. All first dates of species should be 
  recorded.<BR><BR>Best to all<BR>Brian<BR><BR></P></DIV><!--End group email --></BODY></HTML>
