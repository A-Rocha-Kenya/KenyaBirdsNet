  <pre>I visited the Sukari Dam twice on Sunday afternoon, the first visit it was just too hot although I am 99% certain I was watching a male painted snipe walking along the water&#39;s edge at the bottom of the main dam wall.  I got an excellent view of it and dont think it can be anything else.  Is this considered the right area for this bird?

My husband and I returned around 6pm when we drove along the narrow raised road between the water channel and the main dam.  In the pond nearest the end of the road we had a fantastic view of a purple swamphen/gallinule.  This was a first sighting of this bird for me, and the colours were quite stunning.
