Dear all<br>
Just finished a quick 7 days birding trip in search of a few species sort
after by Jonathan Angliss of Dubai.<br><br>
On arrival at the airport late after 3 we headed straight in to the
fields arriving at Gatamaiyu Forest at 1820hrs. Here birds he sort were
Abbott's Starling, Bar-tailed Trogon and Montane Yellow Warbler but was
far too late for last two. Found a male and a female of the <b>Abbott's
Starling</b> going to roost. Really becoming easy to find it at this time
of the year till Nov and or Dec nesting and since I first found the first
nest I believe it's the same pair that has moved about in two different
nests. The first year (2005) the nest was aborted after the tree branch
with the nest fell after a heavy rain and only found single remains of a
dead young one. The following year (2006) the pair moved to a tree some
50 m in to the forest and unfortunately, the tree was brought down by the
local women in quest for much needed firewood. The year 2007 the pair
never nested and if they did never found where they did. 2008 the pair
came back to the same first tree but in a different nesting whole and
most coincidentally a Bar-tailed Trogon nested 2m below the Starlings at
the same time. This single dead tree makes the forest the only reliable
site for the species on earth and so have kept talking to the women
collecting firewood about no where-else and that seems to move their
hearts.&nbsp; Initially, the Angliss' Bird Tour was to visit North of
Garissa and had changed a week before the start dates as i had seen 3
males and a female Abbotts Starling at the forest Camp. So having seen
them the priority shifted from North of Garissa where we would have been
in search of the Collared Lark, a species that we (Brian Finch, Fleur
Ngweno, Ben Muganbi, Nigel Hunter, Gordon Boy, Joseph Kariuki and I) had
found up north some 4 months&nbsp; and had seen it again 2 month ago but
before this it was last recorded in 1967 (though I bet the Gabbra nomads
and the herdsmen had seen it or walked next to their nestlings
occasionally while leading the herds of camels) and others such as
Heuglins Bustard, Somali Crombec and Red-naped Bush-Shrike, So i thought
we'd rather first go look for starling among others on the west he was
still missing. After the Abbott's Starling being seen at 1840hrs it was
already too late for the others and we left for Naivasha after
7:15pm.<br><br>
The following morning left way before the sun rose for Aberdare Ranges in
such of the Aberdare Cisticola, J<b>ackson's Francolin</b>, <b>Montane
Yellow Warbler</b> and the Scarlet-tufted Malachite Sunbird and though we
missed the sunbird as we did not get past the park gate we found a single
<b>Olive Ibis</b> flying above us and ahead, this was just a good
coincident as I never thought of finding the bird for him since they
stopped nesting in the Gatamaiyu Forest late last year. Olive Pigeons
were many in numbers. From the gate the cisticola was calling but not
seen and little did I care as I knew hardly would Molo not offer one. We
drove back to Naivasha and on the way we had Levaillant's Cistiocola and
one big farm where there used to be Sharpe's Longlaw, and so much easier
to find, the farm was half farmed. Never looked for long as it wasnt one
of the target species but knew again that Molo would probably surrender
one for us. <br><br>
This also reminds me that the famous few large open farms at the Flyover
well know and virtually visited by any bird tour in kenya is over 2/3
ploughed. These are the farms we have visited while running the annual
Fundamentals of Ornithology (a course organized by the Naitional Museums
of Kenya, Nature Kenya, Arocha Kenya and Tropical Biology Association)
Soon the bird guides may need to look for another farm and though there
are a couple few remaining, these are 3km off the Nairobi Naivasha Road.
Anyway noticed the ploughing&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 weeks ago on a bird tour
before this one but were still luck found 2 individuals.<br><br>
We head straight for Lake Baringo and arriving for late afternoon tea at
Lake Baringo Club and on the bird feeder table Jonathan did not need my
services to find <b>Northern Masked, Jackson's Golden-backed, Little
Weavers, Jackson's Hornbill</b> and Brown Babblers. The Verreaux's and
the African Scops Owl are in the club's ground. Pearl-spotted Owlet
called just to find it was a Spotted Morning Thrush imitating. <br><br>
The following day on the 21<sup>st</sup> Sept, we left early in the
morning for Kepedo (about 8oKm north) in search of Somali Sparrow which
his list badly needed and stopping along way to search of the <b>Pale
Prinia and Red-fronted Warbler and the Brown-tailed Apalis</b> which were
severally encountered along and on the way back, 2 individuals of
Three-Streaked Tchagra were encountered. We found 5 individuals <b>Somali
Sparrow</b> roosting from the days heat together with Chestnut Sparrow. 1
Crested Lark perched on a post some less than 15m from the sparrows and
showing the crest off. <br>
On our back and near Nginyang' I got a lifer a male <b>Shining
Sunbird</b> being chased by a male Eastern Violet-backed Sunbird from a
flower- loaded Buscia sp. Thanks to Brian Finch who had seen them and so
opened wide my eyes. It was less than 15 sec when I told Jonathan that we
had found all he needed for the day from the area and now was asking him
to find me the sunbird. Our lunch stop along the dry river bed was a
single Pearl-spotted Owlet&nbsp; being ambushed by nearby sunbirds. And
at some water pools formed after the last night showers or rain enough.
Worth noting that our first Brown-tailed Rock Chat was along one of the
dry river bed and far way from any rock outcrop other than the rocky
river bed. A Buff-crested Bustard quietly walked in to the bushes. In the
late afternoon went with William for the usual nocturnal birds such as
the Heuglin's Courser, Spotted Eagle Owl.&nbsp; A few 00's m off Loruk
trading centre were gunshot that scared us early in the morning just to
find the myriads of army training camps. At Nginyang' a single
Wooly-necked Stork and African Harrier Hawk were flying above the trading
centre, a dozen <b>Dark Chanting Goshawk</b> and 10 Northern Wheatear
from Baringo to Kapedo, 2 Gabar Goshawk and one adult <b>Shikra</b>
perched well just along the road. Also past&nbsp; Nginyang&nbsp; were
both Eurasian and African Hoopoe feeding by the road side plus a single
Yellow Wagtail and <b>Desert Cisticola</b> at Kapedo.<br><br>
On 22nd left after&nbsp; breakfast and still not a single Heimplichts
Hornbill but a Rock Kestrel at Lake Baringo. While&nbsp; Kabarnet was a
single Silvery-cheeked Hornbill, Northern Puffback, Scaly-throated
Honeyguide,&nbsp; and on the way down to Kerio Valley were 5 individual
of <b>Chestnut-crowned Sparrow Weavers</b> that despite hearing them call
from the ground took as over 5 minutes to locate and less than 5m away
from our feet and not until one flew away we located them. A family of
Black-headed Gonoleks and a Double-toothed Barbet we down by the Kerio
River. Brown Parisoma on our way up at Tambach and near Eldoret
Grey-rumped Swallow, J<b>ackson's Widowbird</b>s 3 males still wearing
their breeding plumage, Levaillant's Cisticola, Fan-tailed
widowbird.<br><br>
Arriving at Kakamega Forest just after rain had stopped and activities
were high. a Olive-bellied Sunbird just outside the forest on a flowering
hedge and a single Eurasian Honey Buzzard flew over and in the. Such good
view of a single Yellow-billed and Double-toothed Barbets and <b>Turner's
Eremomela </b>were experienced and was my first time to hear them call
though my recording was poor. Black-crowned Waxbill was common along the
way to Rondo and two cases of them nest building. Arriving 1900hrs at
Rondo Retreat Centre.<br><br>
23rd was a day when we spent 10 hours birding in the forest with 83
species which included a different individual of <b>Eurasian Honey
Buzzard</b> (this was adrk one while the previous day we had a grey
individual), 2 Grey Wagtail, 53 Black-n-White Casqued Hornbills (Jonathan
kept a day count on these), Joyfull, Ansorgres, Cabani's, Slender-billed,
Cameroon Sombre, Kakamega Greenbuls, Red-tailed Bristlebill,&nbsp;
Mackinnon's Fiscal now residing at the Rondo Retreat's compound,&nbsp;
Grey-chested and the Brown Illadopsis, Southern Hyliota and Eastern
Bronze-naped Pigeon booing everywhere. <br>
Another full day in the forest clocked a day list of 86 spp adding some
more new birds including 1 Grey Parrot (my first one seen during the
day&nbsp; after 0700hrs) Ive always seen them before 7am and after
1800hrs flying to or from their roosting site and Rondo has been greatly
blessed with such a flyway. Considering that the Blue-headed Bee-eater is
only found here Kakamega and Nandi in the entire of Eastern Africa other
than rest somewhere In Cameroon and Zaire I were gathering some worries
as the bird was posing bigger challenge as we were leaving the day after.
And after losing the hope for the sp for the day and walking back to
Rondo after 1800hrs Jonathan spotted one which in turned was joined by
another one and after about 2 minutes they all left flying in to thick
forest.and that was all the bee eaters seen.&nbsp; The best surprise for
the days was in the morning as we walked a trail we flushed a male
<b>Harlequin's Quail</b>, flew 10m&nbsp; ahead of us then walking at
along the trail with us for the next 15 minutes. How it got into such a
thick forest and why away from the grassland, we cannot figure out,
though being an important source of food to the local tribe I could only
imagine it was an escapee as males are caught and caged put outside
during the night when he (male) calls or sing he does lure others
especially females migrating at night down where they are then caught.
and so this may have escaped and found himself in a forest.<br>
And on our last morning in the forest we still needed African Broadbill
(which we had heard twice), Hairy-breasted Barbet, Black-billed Turaco,
Grey-winged Robin, White-tailed Ant thrush, <b>Chapin's Flycatcher</b>
(which i had never seen and took just long to ID...shame on me),
Blue-shouldered Robin Chat, African Shrike Flycatcher, Yellow-crested
Woodpecker. Tough morning it was only finding the last four species and
increasing my lifers to 2 adding some more energy and fun to my
side.<br><br>
Thanks to Fleur Ng'weno and Peter Wairasho for reporting a Bailon's Crake
that had been seen at the Sukari Ranch a bird that we had seen 9 yrs ago
and though I had seen it I really wanted this time since when I first saw
it I wasnt so much in to appreciating as I was still a farm fresh birder
and getting this note the new idea was we do the papyrus endemics in
Kisumu the same day instead of tomorrow early in the morning&nbsp; and
leave for Kericho instead of spending at Kisumu (if we were lucky) and so
left Kakamega at 2pm and driving straight to Kisumu stopping some place
to look for the Angolan Swallow which we found 2 and another Eurasian
Honey Buzzard making to 4 individuals on the trip. I have not had four
before and a Lanner Falcon both being persuaded by Pied Crows. We were at
Dunga Beach at 1630hrs and by luck we had <b>Papyrus Gonolek and Canary,
Carruther's Cisiticola (also Winding), Swamp Flycatcher, Northern
Brown-throated, Slender-billed Weavers, Red-chested Sunbird</b>s by 1715
plus others such as Water Thicknee and Blue-headed Coucal&nbsp; and so we
headed straight for Kericho arriving at 1930hrs and retiring at the Tea
Hotel. The road is so much smooth compared to 3 yrs ago and so getting
there was good drive.&nbsp; The hotel did well in arranging a special
breakfast at 5am.<br><br>
on 26th left for Sukari Ranch in search for Bailon's Crake passing
through the Molo Grassland and at 0700 already we had found 5individuals
of <b>Aberdare Cisticola</b> (2 were juveniles all in yellow plumaged
front and belly), <b>3 Sharpe's Longclaw</b>, <b>1 Wattled Plover, 1
Levaillant's Cisticola</b>, Hunter's Cisticola were calling behind us we
did not make a step to see them, 2 Malachite Sunbird, 1 Cape Wagtail,
<b>3 Jackson's Widowbird </b>in breeding plumage, Harlequin's Quail
calling. HOWEVER, the most unfortunate and disturbing thing was that a
different farm of about 200arcre was newly ploughed. A farm that I easily
found the Aberdare, Hunter's, Wing-snapping and Levaillant's Cisticolas,
Sharpes Longclaw,&nbsp; and where we had caught and ringed a few
individuals. So in a matter of three weeks span i have watched over 250
acres of natural highland grassland and which were great for the said
species disappear. <br>
This is still a land that I arguably believe Birdlife International or
Wildland Trust, a conservation organization, birding tour companies or
even rich individual should own.&nbsp; And I still dont know or found
any farm/land that do posses all these species and in so conveniently
located on a birding circuit.. while next to this one is a small lake
with nesting pair of Great Crested Grebe (a species thought to account
for less than 50 in Kenya), Maccoa a and White-backed Ducks. The species
found here and the easy is enough to bring most bird tour companies to
buy this land. <br><br>
After Molo headed straight to Sukari Ranch where we spend the whole
afternoon starring at a single bunch of papyrus leaving at 1900 We did
not find the bird though Peter (who arrived at about 1800) had a grimps
of the bird. All we had included a pair of Painted Snipe, Very best views
of the African Water Rail, over 20 Ruff and Wood Sandpipers, 1 Marsh
Sandpiper and a single <b>Little Ringed Plover</b>, 2 Common Squacco
Heron, other common birds included Hottentot Teals, Yellow-billed Storks
among others. Just before driving off at 19150hrs a Montane Nightjar flew
above us and later responded to a tape and came perching some 2m from me,
and finally a late Great Sparrowhawk on the way home flew above closing
down the total list of over 370 sp<br><br>
Interesting that we still can find such a number of species outside any
protected area other than forest reserve such as Kakamega Forest where
even to date indigenous tree on an area or 20m by 13,000m are being cut
on day light in the name of powerline and that tree is blocking the path.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; good birding<br>
