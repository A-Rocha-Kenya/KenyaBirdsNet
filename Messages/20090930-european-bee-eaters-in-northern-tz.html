  <pre>Hi Claudien and everyone,
I first sent this out on 28/9 but it seems to have got lost.
Since arriving back in Arusha (from Ulaya) August 27 we have seen  
remarkably few European Bee-eaters (when compared with 2006 &amp; 2007;  
however 2008 was not so good either) on what used to be a significant  
bee-eater flyway passing around the shoulder of Mount Meru, across  
Arusha and then out over the Maasai steppe. Typically in September  
they are heard/seen in Arusha most often in early evening; as I think  
they are coming down to roost in coffee plantations and relict  
riparian woodland; on the western edge of the Arusha urban area.

By way of contrast Madagascar Bee-eaters have been passing through the  
&#34;Monduli&#34; gap, (also Arusha) in good numbers; this is what I call the  
dry corridor of &#39;lowland&#39; between western Mount Meru &amp; the Monduli  
mountain block.

This lack of Europeans is &#39;corroborated&#39; by our African Morning  
Thrushes who at the appropriate season repeatedly imitate any highly  
vocal (especially any fluty-sounding) migrants who might be passing  
overhead at that time (even nocturnal ones e.g Greenshank which I  
still &#39;need&#39; for the garden!).

Thus: plenty of Madagscar &#34;tree-treeeps&#34; but very few European &#34;pruup- 
pruups&#34; from the AMTs in these very dusty September days.

Incidentally there were plenty of Madagascar Bee-eaters &#39;wired and  
foraging&#39; over the lush green landscape of TPC Sugar Estate, 40km  
south of Kilimanjaro, during the Eidd holiday.

Also, thankfully, we are still seeing small groups (&lt; 10 individuals  
in each) of White-fronted Bee-eater in the irrigated alfalfa and  
sports fields of Mringa-Kimemo-Burka estate; and in the adjacent  
Friedkin-Tanzania Game Trackers recreation grounds (together these  
form a well-timbered &#39;green&#39; wedge between the Nairobi and Dodoma  
roads on the dry west boundary of the town).

Honey Bee numbers generally seem to be holding well here; it&#39;s  
certainly buzzing around the exotic palms flowering in our wild garden  
just now.
Neverthelesst it&#39;s hardly the Itigi thicket - where it&#39;s said the best  
honey in the world comes from!

Good Birds &#39;n all,
James

PS: There were at least 15 European Bee-eaters today (30/9) at a site  
near Sanya Juu in West Kilimanjaro. Where also 2 Cinnamon-chested  
(yesterday) at 1,300m.

&gt; Dear Marcell and All,
&gt;
&gt; Last Friday while I climbed Karisimbi (PNV) we recorded more than 40  
&gt; individuals of European Bee-eaters and a group of more than 60  
&gt; Alpine Swift.
