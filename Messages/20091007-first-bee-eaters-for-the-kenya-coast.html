  <hr/>
  <pre>Just had my first Eurasian Bee-eater over the centre 10 mins ago. Have 
been looking out for them and have had 2s and 3s of Carmine but this was 
the first Eurasian. They clearly move south more inland much sooner than 
along the coast. Humming with Eu Golden Orioles, however - many more 
than I remember in previous years at this time of the year.

Had a good &#39;meeting list&#39; in our Monday morning staff meeting this week:
Osprey - with a huge fish
Mottled Spinetail
Ethiopian Swallow
Black-bellied Starling (moving around in large flocks)
Zanizbar Sombre Greenbul
Trumpeter Hornbill
Gull-billed Tern
and some stunning Golden Orioles in the tree canopy next door to our 
roof-top meeting spot!
