  <hr/>
  <pre>...just had a report today that the forest guides saw a Spotted Ground 
Thrush under the trees around the offices at the forest station. First 
time I&#39;ve heard of one there - though they used to apparently hop around 
the Gede Ruins offices back in the days when there were plenty of them 
(c.15-18 years ago now).

Still plenty of Euro Golden Orioles around and caught an immature male 
Fiery-necked Nightjar on the drive into our house this week which is 
also the first I&#39;ve seen along the sea front.
