<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dr Colin Ryall who used to be in Mombasa and who 
nows lives in UK has just completed a book on the Indian House Crow.&nbsp; He is 
trying to update the present range of the crow.&nbsp; I have already sent a 
request to Colin Jackson in Watamu so he can communicate the situ there and how 
far ranging the crows are at present.&nbsp; The other areas are Voi (if there is 
anyone doing a project in that area) and any possible sightings in Nbi and also 
how far up the Msa Nbi road they have travelled.&nbsp; There is also the Shimba 
Hills, Kwale, Shimoni and Wasini Island.&nbsp; Any info would be very much 
appreciated by Colin whose e-mail is&nbsp;<A 
href="mailto:colin.ryall@ntlworld.com">colin.ryall@ntlworld.com</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Sorry cannot facilitate this myself as I am rather Mombasa bound just now.&nbsp; 
Happy birding or should I say "Happy crowless birding" </FONT></DIV>
