<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I was in Kibwezi/Chyulu hills area as from 29th Septemeber to 3rd of October on a research reconnaissance trip. We were staying in Kibwezi township. During my stay there I didnt record any House crows, but I will be there for another 16 days field work in the Chyulu's doing ornithological work. I will keep an eye for any house crows.&nbsp;</DIV>

<DIV>Later,</DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dr Colin Ryall who used to be in Mombasa and who nows lives in UK has just completed a book on the Indian House Crow.&nbsp; He is trying to update the present range of the crow.&nbsp; I have already sent a request to Colin Jackson in Watamu so he can communicate the situ there and how far ranging the crows are at present.&nbsp; The other areas are Voi (if there is anyone doing a project in that area) and any possible sightings in Nbi and also how far up the Msa Nbi road they have travelled.&nbsp; There is also the Shimba Hills, Kwale, Shimoni and Wasini Island.&nbsp; Any info would be very much appreciated by Colin whose e-mail is&nbsp;<A href="http://us.mc503.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=colin.ryall@ntlworld.com" target=_blank rel=nofollow ymailto="mailto:colin.ryall@ntlworld.com">colin.ryall@ ntlworld. com</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry cannot facilitate this myself as I am rather Mombasa bound just now.&nbsp; Happy birding or
 should I say "Happy crowless birding" </FONT></DIV>
