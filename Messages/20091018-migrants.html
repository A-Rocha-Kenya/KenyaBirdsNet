  <pre>The 12th of October,a good morning for migratory birds in Nairobi National Park: At the Main gate a Willow Warbler; approaching the Kingfisher picknik site a European Cuckoo and near the picknik site a Eurasian Roller and a couple of Eurasian Golden Orioles.On the way to Hippo Pools two Northern Wheatears and at the pools there were many Eurasian Bee-eaters.Common Sandpiper, Green Sandpiper and Common Greenshank were there, as well.On the way back to the main gate a MontaguÂ´s Harrier and near the last turn to Hyena dam on the small swamp to the left of the road Barn Swallows were catching insects over the water and two Black Storks in the sky. On the bare swamp ground there was a Purple Swamphen (non-migrant). Rgds Johanna Maukonen
