<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dear Birders,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>I hear that most of you are sinking in the El Nino 
which so far seems to have missed Mombasa.&nbsp; The walk on Sat 17th went up to 
a very dry Huseini Dairy farm where all the dams are dry except for one that 
seems to have a mysterious supply of water!&nbsp; The grass around the dried up 
dams is at least very green and there were hundreds of Red Billed Quelea and 
lots of Zanzibar Bishops.&nbsp; The first bird we saw was 3 Laughing 
Doves.&nbsp; Although they are found country wide in dry areas this is a first 
for me, in that area, so suppose it&nbsp; says a lot for the state of the 
normally verdant pasture.&nbsp; The dried areas seemed to be providing quite a 
lot of seeds etc and&nbsp;3 starling species, Black Bellied, Greater Blue Earred 
and Superb were there in quite large flocks.&nbsp; Lots of Namaqua Doves, some 
really splendid males.&nbsp; Migrants are now around in larger numbers, hundreds 
of Barn Swallows (my first of the year), several Common Sandpipers (but no other 
waders) and a superb male Eurasian Golden Oriole really displaying in front of 
us as he moved around the small shrubs (most of the big trees having been 
chopped).&nbsp; A big flock of Carmine Bee-eaters came to feed on insects from 
the dam, taking their treats back to one of the bigger trees.&nbsp; My birders 
are always so pleased to see these bee-eaters and in the setting sun their 
colours were truly magnificent.&nbsp; One down point was the large number of 
Indian House Crows, feeding around the dam and on the rubbish which has been 
dumped.&nbsp; We did see one brave Black Kite and another unidentifed bird of 
prey passing far away.&nbsp; It takes a lot of courage to brave these murauding 
black pirates of the sky.&nbsp; Total of 29 species seen in 11/2 hrs!&nbsp; Not 
bad! Keep on birding, it is so great!&nbsp; (Marlene Reid -
