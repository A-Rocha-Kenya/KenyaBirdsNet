At Paradise Lost in Kiambu on October 7, Nature Kenya's Wednesday Morning Birdwalk found Eurasian Bee-eaters, Spotted Flycatcher and a very early immature migrant shrike &#8211; probably Isabelline (Red-tailed).<BR>
<BR>
In late October, Nairobi National Park turned from brown to green, especially around Hyena Dam. On October 31, between Hyena Dam and the Bypass Road, a magnificent Kori Bustard was displaying to another, and a single White Stork was foraging in the new green grass.<BR>

Wishing you good birding, Fleur</SPAN></FONT>
