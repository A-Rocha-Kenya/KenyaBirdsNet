<BR>
In Nairobi, many birds apparently began to breed when there were some light showers at the peak of the drought. Birds in my garden suddenly started singing one and half hours earlier in mid-August, although they had to wait until mid-October for real rain. Young birds are now everywhere, including:<BR>
<BR>
One Ostrich chick, about the size of a large chicken, with its parents, in Nairobi National Park on October 17.<BR>
<BR>
Young Helmeted Guineafowl and Yellow-necked Spurfowl in several places in Nairobi National Park since mid-October.<BR>
<BR>
Young Common Bulbul, Baglafecht Weaver and Village Weavers wing-shivering and fed by adults in my garden this first week of November.<BR>

Wishing you good birding, Fleur</SPAN></FONT>
