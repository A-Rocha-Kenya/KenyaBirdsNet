  <pre>Karen and Patrick Plumbe, Graham,  James Wainaina, Zackary and I visited Eburu Forest early yesterday morning. We drove up through dry cold agricultural land and observed the system of extracting drinking water from steam vents by condensation into jerry cans. It was cold, frost lay on the ground and apart from a few seedeaters, good numbers of Stone Chats and a brown parisoma there wasn&#39;t a lot of activity until we got into the trees. The forest ranger hut sits a long way from any forest and was locked up and didn&#39;t look much used so we couldn&#39;t sign in. For the first part, most of the forest was secondary growth, regenerating from the time when much of it was cleared for potato growing, but large numbers of sheep, goats and cattle were preventing regeneration from taking place too rapidly. We climbed up through bamboo and enjoyed good sightings of Brown Woodland warbler, Cinnamon Bracken warbler and White-tailed crested flycatchers. Both white and rufous morphs of Paradise Flycatchers were evident. Hill Babblers were singing and Mountain Greenbuls easy to see. However, there was huge evidence of a vibrant charcoal business from the maze of trails cut into the bamboo and the spoor of the donkeys used to carry the sacks. Then in a broad leafed clearing we had a great time watching 12 White headed hoopoes foraging amongst tree bark , Fine banded woodpecker and mountain yellow warblers, Northern double collared and Tacazze sunbirds fed on a leonotis and there were Black and Grey cuckoo shrikes. There were also good views of Chestnut throated and Grey apalis, Blackcap, Scaly throated and Lesser Honeyguides. At that point 6 donkeys laden with charcoal, 2 hunting dogs and their 3 human  owners wandered past us. Zackary contacted the  forest department to inform them of the load going down the hill but was asked instead if we had permission to be in the forest.
Above the bamboo the scene is sickening, huge areas of forest have been felled and are in all stages of the charcoal making process. There was little sign of animals apart from donkeys. Birds in that clearing included a Eurasian Hobby, Golden winged sunbirds (with males trying to chase off fledged young) Yellow Crowned  Canaries, Hunters Cisticolas and Olive Thrushes.
If the Bongo still exists it must be in deep trouble. We have a lot of photographic evidence of our trip if anyone would be interested.
