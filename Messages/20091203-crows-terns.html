  <pre>Every full moon we&#39;re doing an estimate of the number of terns roosting at the Sabaki River Mouth at night - using the light of the moon when full to assist in being able to see them (not for some bizarre full moon ritual!). En route to Sabaki we go early &amp; count the House Crows going to roost - nicely &#39;killing (counting) two birds with one stone (trip)&#39; kind of thing! 

Yesterday was full moon (in fact there is a Blue Moon this month - a second full moon in the month right at the end) &amp; so we did the counts. Without having been given the final tally of both teams, there were significantly higher numbers of crows counted at our site - c.1,700 (previous counts have been 1,000-1,200).

The terns however were far fewer - only c.12,000 total as opposed to a couple of months ago when we estimated between 80-110,000 birds roosting!

As I say, we&#39;re doing this every full moon so if anyone is interested to join us &amp; is around Malindi / Watamu at that time - karibu sana.
