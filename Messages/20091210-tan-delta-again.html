  <pre>We were in the Tana Delta again recently. On the way down it rained along
the section of the Mombasa Road between Manyani and Voi which brought out
termites and something like between a thousand and 1200 Eurasian Rollers
feeding on them. There were also a few small falcons joining in the feast
but not identified as stopping along this road between thundering trucks and
wild busses is not advisable. In the Mererani saltworks some 200 flamingos
could be seen close to the road.

At the river mouth in Kipini we were testing the methodology for the
development of a digital elevation model using differential GPS, not the
best way to watch birds but on the sandspit south of the main river mouth
across from the Tana River Lodge we did see a group of 150 crab plovers
(with a substantial proportion of immature birds) and an estimated 6000
terns (see attached). We roughly counted a subgroup of these which yielded
some 600 Saunder&#39;s, 350 Common, 100 Lesser-crested and a sprinkling of
Gull-billed and Caspian. There were also a few dozen Sooty Gulls hanging
around and at least one adult pink-legged black-backed gull easily twice the
bulk of the Sooty, so I assume Heuglin&#39;s. The usual African Fish Eagles and
thousands of unidentified waders on the mudflats with confirmed
White-fronted Plover, Terek Sandpiper, Greenshank,  Grey Plover, Lesser Sand
Plover.
