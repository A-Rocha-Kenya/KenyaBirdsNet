  <hr/>
  <pre>Dear all
I&#39;m writing this mail on behalf of Edwin Selempo, an avid birder and 
a member of  KenyaBirdsNet, whose yahoo account (Edwin Selempo 
&lt;e.selempo@yahoo.com&gt;)has been hacked by unknown person and has been 
used to try to solicit for money claiming that he&#39;s stranded in the 
UK.  This is NOT true and in deed he is in Nairobi. Please ignore any 
such messages .  He is grateful to those of you who&#39;ve phoned him up 
to inform him.
and he regret the inconveniences caused by the email.
You may reach him via 0720 590 401

Many thanks and have a MERRY BIRDING XMAS
chege

Also this should be a good warning to rest of the member on yahoo. DO 
NOT ACCEPT any mail from yahoo telling you that there is a problem 
with your yahoo account and therefore to give your full names, email 
and password. NO NO NOOO don&#39;t
