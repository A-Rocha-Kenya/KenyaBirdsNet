Gatamaiyu Forest provided a cool green space for Nature Kenya&#8217;s Sunday Birdwatch on December 20. The birding highlight was a mixed flock of starlings feeding in Polyscias trees as we ate our picnic at the Fishing Camp. Most of them &#8211; over 20 &#8211; were Sharpe&#8217;s Starlings. A few were all black, presumably Waller&#8217;s Starlings, although we did not see them very well.<BR>
<BR>
The Wednesday Morning Birdwalk at the Racecourse on December 23 featured a handsome Ayres&#8217; Hawk Eagle and a number of migrants:<BR>
Nightingale, Blackcap, Garden Warbler, Willow Warbler and Yellow Wagtail.<BR>

Wishing you good holiday birding, Fleur</SPAN></FONT>
