&gt;  Hi all 
&gt;    
&gt;  The new wader atlas just arrived. Flicking through 
&gt; it I see that this bird is not mapped for Lake Victoria but we have recent 
&gt; records from Speke Bay 
&gt;  during the most recent period of lower water 
&gt; levels. 
&gt;    
&gt;  Any records at all from Kenya or Uganda 
&gt; ? 
&gt;    
&gt;  Many thanks 
&gt;
