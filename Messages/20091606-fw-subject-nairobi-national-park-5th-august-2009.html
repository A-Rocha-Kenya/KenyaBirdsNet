Only the<BR>eastern half
 was visited, between Main Gate to Athi Dam, then<BR>returning the same way exiting Langata Gate. The power was off the<BR>entire day and so it was a good alternative to staying at home unable<BR>to work. I saw Fiona’s posting yesterday, and whole heartedly agree<BR>that the wiring off of the Epauletted Fruit-Bat colony at the Main<BR>Entrance gate really showed us what kind of conservation minded people<BR>we have working in KWS. It is shameful, and I think that Nature Kenya<BR>should complain about the outrage. Whilst at it ask why there is in<BR>invasion of domestic animals back into the Park, and they have not<BR>taken any action as to their removal.<BR><BR>It was a cold, unpleasant overcast morning, but by mid-day the sun was<BR>showing signs of breaking through and after a chilly morning the<BR>afternoon was pleasantly warm. There was nothing of note from the<BR>entrance, nor much to report from Ivory Burning Site, a steady stream<BR>of Sacred
 Ibis, Cattle Egrets and Long-tailed Cormorants were leaving<BR>their roost on Nagalomon Dam, as did up to one hundred Grosbeak<BR>Weavers. Nor was there much along the back road towards Hyena Dam,<BR>except for two Green Sandpipers flying around, which could relate to<BR>two single birds seen subsequently in the same area. At Hyena Dam<BR>there was a Great Egret and three African Water Rails calling from<BR>cover, along the run off were a further two African Water Rails and a<BR>calling Red-chested Flufftail, the female Saddle-billed Stork was in<BR>the meadow with a Yellow-billed Egret, and the female Whinchat was in<BR>the usual place. Yellow-crowned Bishop numbers were in lesser numbers,<BR>only about fifty at this site, there appeared to be more that were<BR>showing yellow-rumps again, but that would make no sense whatsoever,<BR>but then there was a Red-collared Widowbird with a fairly full tail.<BR>The Jackson’s Widowbirds were in non-breeding
 dress, and small numbers<BR>were in the reeds that also sheltered small numbers of Zebra Waxbills.<BR>Quailfinch were in such numbers all over the area visited, that they<BR>are now the secondmost numerous species in the Park, and with the<BR>number of White-winged Widowbirds approaching thousands this gives an<BR>indication of their abundance. There were a couple of Rosy-breasted<BR>Longclaws here, but just the other side of the circuit road (5A) about<BR>four were giving a fluttering display flight but without song, and<BR>four White-tailed Larks were also fluttering over the grass and<BR>involved in aerial chases again without any song. There were over<BR>eighty Wattled Starlings riding the backs of the numerous Zebra. On<BR>the inside road route to Eland Hollow Dam was a Tawny Eagle with a<BR>good size though still all white chick on a nest in a Balanites. The<BR>single adult seen was very black, far more so than other Tawny Eagles<BR>resident in
 the Park. Eland Hollow produced a couple of<BR>Yellow-throated Sandgrouse, with another five at Karen Primary School<BR>Dam. Here amongst the numerous Yellow-crowned Bishops and Quailfinch<BR>coming to drink were a pair of African Silverbills, and another eight<BR>were found just after the “Beacon.” Maybe these are the forerunners of<BR>another incursion into the Park, just like last year. Towards the<BR>turn-off to Embakasi Dam (not visited), there were some fifteen Athi<BR>Short-toed Larks. Athi Dam was not too busy, with one each of adult<BR>Pink-backed and White Pelicans, three adult Black-crowned Night<BR>Herons, a Great Egret, some fifty more Yellow-throated Sandgrouse, and<BR>the pair of Spur-winged Plover still incubating and spending much time<BR>chasing off Marabous but there were only three Kittlitz’s Plovers. I<BR>took time examining the palearctic waders present.&nbsp; All were adults<BR>apart from one Common Sandpiper that I could
 not be sure of. There<BR>were four Common Sandpipers, a Greenshank, and two Little Stints all<BR>of which looked much like the birds from last Saturday. New arrivals<BR>were an adult female Ruff with blackish blotchy upper and underparts,<BR>not the scaly buff upperparts and fairly uniform buffy underparts of<BR>young birds, and a Wood Sandpiper with white speckled upperparts<BR>rather than the buff spots on the upper parts of young birds. The one<BR>strange Common Sandpiper was so unapproachable had blotchy blackish<BR>spots on the side of the chest, rather plainish upperparts, tail<BR>shorter than wings, pale base to the bill. I have attached the bird<BR>with an adult Common Sandpiper taken at the same time. Also the adult<BR>Ruff and Wood Sandpiper so that the difference between adult and young<BR>birds can be appreciated. So still no evidence of any birds of the<BR>year arriving as yet.<BR>Leaving the dam there were the only two Lilac-breasted
 Rollers of the<BR>day, and at Forest edge dam the currently resident African Jacana and<BR>another adult Wood Sandpiper.<BR>Swallow numbers very much down, on the open plains the only members of<BR>the family were singles and small groups of Banded Martins. The only<BR>Red-rumped were a pair at Athi Dam.<BR>Mammals were quite spectacular, Wildebeest numbers up to a few<BR>hundred, although the largest single group was only thirty.<BR><BR>Best to all<BR><BR>Brian<BR><BR>PS I have just received photos of a Bar-tailed Trogon seen the last<BR>two days in the Mara, there is no doubt as to it’s identity.<BR></DIV></div></body></html>
