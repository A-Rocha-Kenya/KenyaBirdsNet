<FONT FACE="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><SPAN STYLE='font-size:14.0px'>The marvelous passage of migrants through Nairobi continues.<BR>
<BR>
Last week, Great Reed Warblers were reported from UNEP, National Museum, Upper Hill and Langata. Today there are Marsh and Sedge Warblers in my garden &#8211; and the largest wetland there is the bird bath.<BR>
<BR>
Nairobi National Park continues to be terrific, with vast herds of plains game and prominent Eurasian Rollers, Red-backed and Lesser Grey Shrikes. On a late afternoon visit on Sunday (April 26) we saw a sight I had not seen for many years: Mount Kenya towering over the city, and at the same time, Kilimanjaro with its head in the clouds.<BR>

Wishing you good birding, Fleur</SPAN></FONT>
