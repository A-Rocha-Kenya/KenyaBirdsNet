 to have a day in Nairobi National<br>Park on 14th August 2009, as it
 was a scheduled power-out day for us.<br>We entered the gate at 6:30am and made straight for Ivory Burning<br>Site.<br>It was an incredibly beautiful morning, sunny and bright, blue sky but<br>quite cold, however much more cheerful than it has been of late, and<br>the birds were obviously pleased with the clear morning.<br>Apart from the Long-tailed Cormorants and Cattle Egrets leaving their<br>roosts on Nagalomon Dam, swallows had also roosted there, a few Black<br>Saw-wings flew into the picnic area from there, and followed by others<br>until there was a staggering eighty saw-wings. I have never seen such<br>numbers before, and it would appear that they roosted with the<br>accompanying Plain Martins in the reeds, this would be a surprise as I<br>thought they roosted in holes in banks. There were about a dozen<br>Violet-backed Starlings feeding on a fruiting bush, a party of eight<br>Red-collared Widowbirds had non-breeding plumaged males with
 almost<br>fully developed tails and appear to be entering breeding condition<br>again. There were a number of birds feeding in the clearing, the<br>biggest surprise being a Somali Bunting. Whether this was the bird<br>seen at the back of Hyena Dam in the early part of this year isn’t<br>clear. I have compared photographs with this bird and the last (which<br>was the first for NNP), and they do look different, but there can be a<br>lot of plumage change over six months. Another bird that came as a<br>surprise was a male Black Cuckooshrike, not unusual in itself, but<br>this bird was a most beautiful shiny blue with a huge bright yellow<br>shoulder patch. I have only ever seen a very few in Kenya, and have<br>thought that yellow-shouldered birds originated from the south. The<br>field-guides don’t mention anything specific as to the provenance of<br>these beautiful birds (when compared to our all dark birds that we<br>normally see). Does anyone else
 remember seeing the bird in Kenya, and<br>at what time of year?<br>At the back of Hyena Dam there were two African Silverbills bathing,<br>but there was nothing much at the Dam itself. The run-off was far more<br>interesting with single Great and Yellow-billed Egrets, a<br>Lilac-breasted Roller, a single Barn Swallow, the female Whinchat, a<br>dense flock of 150 Wattled Starings (others seen elsewhere), a few<br>Zebra Waxbills and plenty of Quailfinch. Near 5A were two Oribi, a<br>couple of White-tailed Lark that were singing half-heartedly in<br>flight, and a distant flock of twenty Athi Short-toed Larks. At Karen<br>Primary School Dam were three Yellow-throated Sandgrouse, three adult<br>Wood Sandpipers, with a number of Quailfinch Red-billed Quelea and<br>Yellow-crowned Bishops coming in to drink. At Embakasi Dam very large<br>numbers of Yellow-crowned Bishops and Red-billed Quelea arriving flock<br>after flock from the direction of JKA. A Peregrine
 was hunting over<br>the area making several stoops but not securing anything. Athi Dam was<br>very disappointing with a single Black-crowned Night-Heron, a pair of<br>Spur-winged Plover that were not seen to incubate so maybe the eggs<br>have hatched, adults of&nbsp; Little Stint, two Greenshank and five Common<br>Sandpipers, all looking like the same birds from earlier in the week.<br>Nothing noted from here to Kingfisher Picnic Site where there were<br>four Lilac-breasted Rollers and a Barn Swallow flying through, the<br>African Jacana was on Kisembe Forest edge Dam and a Nairobi Pipit<br>along the edge of the forest. We departed through Langata Gate at<br>2:45pm.<br><br>Not much change from Wednesday the last powercut day, still plenty of<br>cattle in the south, and numerous Zebra and Wildebeeste from Hyena Dam<br>to Athi Dam. Mammalwise the Park is very impressive.<br><br>Best to all<br><br>Brian<br><br>PS Rupert had a Bat Hawk at dusk over his
 garden (Kisembe<br>Estate-Langata) on Tuesday evening.<br></div></div></div></div>
