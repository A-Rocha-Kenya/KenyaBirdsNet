  <hr/>
  <pre>On 20th August, a group consisting of Itai Shanni, Chege Kariuki,
Andrew Kamiti, Richard and Ann Bishop, Daniel Vaknin and myself
departed Nairobi for another short look at the Garissa region.
On the first expedition back in May we spent much time completing a
630km circuit Garissa back to Garissa so that whilst getting into some
other habitats we spent much of the time travelling even though we had
one day longer than on this occasion. For this trip we concentrated on
our original Collared Lark site, and the fairly immediate vicinity,
spending most of our time in the bush and collecting interesting data.

On the previous trip no mention was made of the Bafirawari Flycatcher
in the report published on the net, as the research had not commenced
at that point, but it was mentioned in forthcoming text. As well as
the Collared Lark we wanted to get more information on this enigmatic
flycatcher, treated as the species Wahjeir Grey Flycatcher in
Mackworth-Praed and Grant, but subsequently relegated to a desert form
of Pale Flycatcher by subsequent authors, although some recent
checklists have reinstated it specifically. Thus forgotten, when we
rediscovered this form on our first sortie it had not been reported
since it&#39;s initial collection back in 1940.

David Fisher located the type specimen in the collection at Tring, and
although it is not known for certain how Jackson&#39;s collection was
subsequently distributed, Robert Prys-Jones the curator indicated that
much of it crossed the Atlantic. In the pure stands of Commiphora
(species not identified) with scattered Acacia turnbulliana, it was
the most common bird species in that habitat, maybe up to one-hundred
individuals were seen on our investigations here, but only two Grey
Flycatchers of the race burae were seen in this habitat. By contrast
in areas of scrubby Acacias with scattered Commiphora and Balanites,
Grey Flycatcher was common but bafirawari was completely absent. As it
was common in all pure Commiphora stands that we visited, this seems
to be a real ecological separation of the two species.

The indication of the presence of Bafirawari  came from a photograph
that I took hurriedly whilst racing to catch up with a singing
Collared Lark whose vocalisations at the time were unrecorded. Not
much attention was given to the flycatchers whilst we were present, as
our focus was on the Lark, which itself at that time had not been seen
by any living ornithologist since 1967, and was far more spectacular
than the dowdy flycatcher whose importance was not realised until
after we had returned.

Breeding had obviously finished, most birds were pairs, but there were
trios and the very occasional group of four. Only one individual young
bird still showing traces of speckled immature plumage was seen and
this was photographed by Chege. For the best part the birds were
completely silent, but one group was chattering and singing, sadly
this was not recorded with a microphone but as part of a video where
it is rather quiet. The birds were flighty and active in the early
mornings, and difficult to approach, but by the middle of the day when
it was warmer they became more lethargic and sought the shade in the
depths of the leafless Commiphoras.

It is difficult to imagine how this isolated high density species with
such restrictive habitat requirements in the  sub-desert, is
conspecific with the very different looking and very low density Pale
Flycatcher of the high-rainfall, broad-leaved forest edges in the
remainder of Kenya. I feel sure that DNA work on the Tring specimen
will show this form as a specific entity, but this will require the
follow-up of scientists in this field which is beyond the scope of our
field observations.

Here is a comparison of our widespread murinus with bafirawari.

GENERAL APPEARANCE
Bafirawari is a smaller, slender and longer-tailed, short-winged grey
and whitish bird with quite a striking face pattern and low crown.
Pale is a stout bird with a short tail, upperparts are brown
(especially the wings), underparts are soiled white and buffy, lacking
any facial pattern, and a high domed crown.

IN DETAIL
Head: Bafirawari shows a long and heavy entirely black bill, whereas
pallidus has a short and weak dark bill with an extensive pale base to
the lower mandible. Bafirawari has a very broad and conspicuous white
supercilium extending from the back of the eye to the lores and in
some birds across the lower forehead, together with the white ring on
the lower eye-lid gives the bird a very bespectacled look. Behind the
eye is a long blackish line that separates the grey crown from the
grey face. The black line also extends from the front of the eye to
the base of the lower mandible. Pale lacks a face pattern, or at most
some birds may show a faint paler loral line and a dark line to the
base of the mandible. There is no dark line behind the eye, more than
a dark folding of the feathers.
Wings: Bafirawari has blackish flight feathers, these are
conspicuously, narrowly and neatly edged whitish on the inner
primaries, the secondaries and wing coverts. The closed wing at times
appears as a pale panel on the secondaries, and the primaries all
dark. The dramatic length of the tail makes the wings look short.
Pallidus has brownish or dark greyish, not blackish flight feathers,
with pale to warm buff edgings that are finer, less contrasting and
untidy. On the closed wing these pale edges can be seen on the
primaries. From some angles Bafirawari shows a very rounded wing.
Tail: Bafirawari has a long narrow tail, paler and greyer than flight
feathers, narrowly edged whitish. Outer tail feathers are shorter than
central tail, giving a rounded tail, and from below a graduated  tail
with the longer inner tail protruding well below the shorter outers.
Pale has a shorter tail with the feathers of equal length, this gives
a square-ended impression.
Underparts: Bafirawari is consistently pale, with a very white throat,
and the underparts like the rest of the bird have no traces of any
buff or warm colouration. Pale is variable but not as pale, usually
there is a warmer tinge rather than just pale grey and white.
Habits: Bafirawari is a very light and graceful bird in flight, and
when perched the unfanned tail is frequently raised over the back much
like a scrub-robin. Whilst perched the tail is usually in motion,
either being flicked, raised, even swung to the side. It is used as a
balance, actually pointed forward under the branch on which it is
perched. Most flights are only a metre or so above the ground. Food is
taken on the ground from a raised perch. Pale is a heavy and rather
ponderous flycatcher, that behaves more like a chat dropping down on
its prey from a raised perch sometimes as high as a telephone wire.
The perched bird flicks it tail at times, but does not usually raise
it over the back for any length of time.

Of the remaining species there were no surprises. The area was very
dry and leafless, birds were quite silent but in spite of the drought
the place did not appear as devastatingly dry as parts of the Ukambani
from Matuu to Mwingi.
The roads were in good condition, some of the worst parts met with
three months previously had been repaired.
On the twenty kilometres of tarmac through the Commiphora/Terminalia
woodland west of Garissa we had road-killed Caracal, Aardwolf, Civet,
Common Genet, Desert Warthog, Aardvark and Crested Porcupine. If this
is a nightly event, then the slaughter on this road is massive.
