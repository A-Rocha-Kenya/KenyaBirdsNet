<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Sat. July 18th - Lower part of Nguu Tatu, in 
Lafarge shale quarry, bordering the fenced wetland of Nguuni Wildlife 
Sanctuary</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>It is very exciting to see bird species taking up 
residence on this fairly new small wetland.&nbsp; The pond on the way is 
&nbsp;pretty overgrown but a small group of African Golden Weavers were 
nesting.&nbsp; We have seen the odd one here before but this time there were 
several, males and females with males nest building.&nbsp; Hopefully the 
beginning of a permanent breeding group!&nbsp; They share the habitat with 
Golden Palm, Grosbeak and Village Weavers.&nbsp; At the wetland interesting 
birds seen - Spur Winged Plovers, Madagascar Squacco, Purple Heron, Common 
Moorhen, one adult and one juvenile so obviously breeding, Common Sandpiper (may 
have been 1 or 2 as we may have been seeing one bird twice).&nbsp; Don't think 
this is an early arrival as we nearly always see a Common Sandpiper no matter 
what the season.&nbsp; Non-breeding birds which over-winter maybe?&nbsp; Lots of 
Water Dikkops, White Faced Whistling Ducks and African Jacanas.&nbsp; Spoonbills 
(which apparently rose to number 10) and Pelicans sadly departed.&nbsp; The most 
exciting bird of the day was a Glossy Ibis flying in and landing among the 
Sacred Ibis.&nbsp; I have never seen a Glossy in this area and note that Ryall 
in his article on Afrotropical species does not list it as present at Nguuni 
(Scopus Vol. 15 No. 1 Aug. 1991).&nbsp; Must submit this to bird 
committee.&nbsp; Always something exciting and unexpected in the birding 
world.&nbsp; Welcome to Mombasa Bird Walk (every 3rd Sat in the month) when you 
are next in Mombasa.&nbsp; If your visit does not fit in with a walk I will be 
happy to put you in contact with our excellent group of bird guides or recommend 
places to go.&nbsp; My number is 0720 949195 or 2491648.&nbsp; (Marlene

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Addendum:&nbsp; While walking in Nyali yesterday 
(Mon 20th July), on Greenwood Drive,&nbsp;I saw 2 Eurasian Golden Orioles, 
didn't have my bins but would say they were immature males.&nbsp; Are they early 
arrivals or did they never leave?&nbsp; Would welcome an expert opinion.
