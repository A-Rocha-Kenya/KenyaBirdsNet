  <pre>Dear All,

I arrived at the Main Entrance 6-20am, the gate was open and I was
soon in the Park. It was a cloudy start to the morning, there was
heavy cloud over Nairobi for much of the day but it was clear to the
south, and the sun was out for nearly all day, and very warm. There
was nothing along the entrance road, and things were very quiet. I
started at the Ivory Burning Site, where there was some evidence of a
return passage. Two Saddle-billed Storks flew by, one being located
later near Hyena Dam. Palearctic migrants at the picnic area included
at least six Nightingales, singles of Whinchat, Spotted Flycatcher,
Tree Pipit, Eurasian Reed Warbler, Garden Warbler, Eurasian Golden
Oriole, and the two Upcher&#39;s Warblers. Along the back road there were
a further two Nightingales, single Eurasian and Marsh Warblers, also a
black Gabar Goshawk and a Peregrine. Near the small swampy area there
was a male Eurasian Rock Thrush. Taking the back road into Hyena Dam
there were the first of four Red-backed and the first of six
Red-tailed Shrikes (all phoenicuroides). Ten Lesser Kestrels were
resting in an acacia, and only two others were seen after this. There
was little at the dam, strangely African Water Rails, Little Rush
Warblers and Lesser Swamp Warblers were vocal in spite of there being
no sign of the drought breaking. The African Jacana was still there,
some six Yellow Wagtails (lutea) were following Zebra, there was a
single Sedge Warbler in the aquatic vegetation. Something put up
larks, in the adjacent grassy plain, and there were over 150 Athi
Short-toed Larks in the air at one time.  On the circuit road (via
`6&#39;), there were four Rosy-breasted Longclaws in view on small bushes
at one time, and like many Pectoral-patch Cisticolas these were
singing and displaying. Crossing the Mokoyiet there was a Spotted
Flycatcher (one of four more), and taking the road to Olmanyi Dam
there were a dozen African Silverbills. At the dam the falling level
attracted 13 African Spoonbills, thirty Yellow-billed Stork, and
assemblage of Marabous and a Great Egret. Around the edge were two
Common Snipe, one each of Greenshank and Green Sandpiper, and a couple
of Crimson-rumped Waxbills.
