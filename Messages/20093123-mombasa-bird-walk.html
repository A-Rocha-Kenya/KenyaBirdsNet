<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Sat. 21st Feb. - Nguuni Sanctuary, Nguu 
Tatu</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>With the hope of seeing some migrants which have 
seemed very elusive this year we thought we would visit the ponds at 
Nguuni.&nbsp; Everything very dry and water levels low leaving lots of wading 
space and plenty of perching places.&nbsp; In two hours we saw some 50 bird 
species, a record I think.&nbsp; On the walk up to the wetland we had good views 
of White Browed Scrub Robin and White Browed Robin Chat. The wetland was 
spectacular so many birds no doubt due to most of the other ponds being 
completely dry.&nbsp;8 Pink Backed Pelicans which have been absent for ages, 
Yellow Billed Storks, a magnificent Goliath Heron, Little Grebes, Water Dikkops, 
Spur Winged Plover, African Jacana, White Faced Whistling Ducks, Grey and Black 
Headed Heron, Malachite and Pied Kingfisher, Long Tailed Cormorant, Great White 
Egret, a single African Spoonbill (years since we saw that around) a tree full 
of Carmine Bee-eaters, Lots of Barn Swallows flying over and dipping down for a 
drink or to catch an insect and a lovely pair of Scarlet chested sunbirds.&nbsp; 
Walking back through the acacia woodland I saw the first of many Spotted 
Flycatchers (my first this season) and a big group of Northern Brownbuls, easily 
seen for once due to the bare trees. A drive up to the picnic area where we saw 
Sulphur Breasted Bushshrike, Greater Blue Earred Starling and a single female 
Violet Backed Starling.&nbsp; Lots of Red Billed Quelea and Zanzibar Bishops and 
a lovely group of Common Waxbills.&nbsp; Yellow and African Pied Wagtail, Bare 
Eyed Thrush and Red Cheeked Cordon Bleus covered the ground space and a pair of 
Black Headed Batis hopped around in the nearby bush.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two Palm Nut 
Vultures flew overhead, one a juvenile and the Carmine Bee-eaters decided to 
give us a wonderful flying display.&nbsp; As the light failed, and we still 
lingered we caught sight of a Gabon Nightjar, moving along the ground having 
what seemed like a dust bath, flying up just in front of us so we could get 
clear views of the tail which helped us ID it.&nbsp; Have never seen this 
behaviour from a nightjar before.&nbsp; I had really hoped to see a Wheatear and 
just as we were turning to the car a female Northern Wheatear ran across the 
gorund in front of us.&nbsp; The only migrant wader seen was a Common Sandpiper. 
A really great walk, wonderful that we had a visitor from Europe with us and 
great that there were quite a few "lifers" for several members of the 
group.&nbsp; Keep birding and feel free to join us if you are in Mombasa.&nbsp;

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Note:&nbsp; The Ayres Eagle&nbsp;(can't swear it is 
the same one) which usually visits Tudor Creek Oct-Mar although not a migrant 
and coming from I know not where, has been joined by a second bird this year so 
two of them riding the thermals in the afternoons calling and 
displaying.&nbsp;&nbsp; Would appreciate some comment or idea&nbsp;as 
to&nbsp;why this raptor only appears during this windy season.&nbsp; The only 
year it didn't appear was a year when there was no wind to speak of.&nbsp;
