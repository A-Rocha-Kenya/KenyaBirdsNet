Dear all,

I spent the day at the NNP and birds were not in good numbers, even the animals. I could see white-winged Widowbirds in good number and a few Yellow Bishops. No more Jackson&#39;s and Red-collared Widowbirds. Buntings are back in the forest edge and near Kingfisher. It was the Cinnamon-breasted Rock-Bunting and the Yellow-breasted Bunting. A Green Pigeon was drinking at the forest edge dam. Quail-finches were in good number and a few Zebra were seen and pictured. The most interesting for me was a dark morph Gabar Goshawk near Hyena dam. I don&#39;t know if it is common in the park because it&#39;s the first time I could see one here. Some Dideric Cuckoos were seen but no other species (unless eared).

Good birding,

Patrick the Belgian
