  <pre>Dear all,

I spent the day with my son at the National Park today and 3 birds surprised me. We saw a pair of Brown Parrot preparing a hole in a tree for nesting near Hyena Dam and near Kingfisher, we saw a Red-billed Buffalo-Weaver and a Chestnut Sparrow... Incredible but true.
Cuckoos were not in good number today. We saw 4 Dideric Cuckoos, 1 Levailant Cuckoo and 1 Black-and-White Cuckoo. We visited the park 4 weeks ago and THAT was the Cuckoos day. We saw 17 Dideric Cuckoos, 13 Black-and-white Cuckoos pica and 4 serratus. A really good day!!!
I met Brian today and I want to thank him for the time he spent with us.
Good birding,

Patrick
