  <pre>Dear all
Last sunday drove down magadi road with non-birding friend till 
Olorgesailie. Though not a birding trip, a few stops along the way 
after a hard press produced 66spp.

Notable includes 3 Abyssinian Scimitarbill high up near Corner Baridi 
(i&#39;ve always seen them below ICROSS), Only 1sp and 1 individual bird 
of prey, Eastern Pale Chanting Goshawk...... i think for sometimes i 
haven&#39;t seen more than 3 in day and they were common along the power 
poles. Only 1 Namaqua Dove, 3 Eurasian or African cuckoos and all 
crossing the road and away. May be African Cuckoo by date and the 
month?. 3 groups of Lyne&#39;s Cisticolas and all singing. a single and 
very co-operative Black-necked Weaver... photographed.

The only Paelearctic Migrant was 2 different individuals of Sedge 
Warblers. one at below Olepolos and another one at the 2 road side 
dam before Ol Tepesi.

As we drove back late found a stalled car and decided to pull them to 
Kiserian. Going up the hill a snake (prob a Boomslang but not sure) 
crossed and stopped next to the car in front. The pulled party were 
not happy not to have killed it and the fact taking off again on the 
steep hill as a big deal.

I only counted one truck caring loads of firewood (prob its just a 
sunday)  otherwise on the week days i have counted to 5 in a day.
cheers
  chege
