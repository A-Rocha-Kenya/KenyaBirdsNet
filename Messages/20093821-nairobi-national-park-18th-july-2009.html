  <pre>Dear All,
I was in the Park in the afternoon of July 18th.

It was not a birding outing, there was a flock of 32 Crowned Cranes
near Lone Tree which is a bit of a record.

The dry period has drawn mammals back into the park, and there are
large numbers of Zebra, Eland and a good few Wildebeeste in the Beacon
area. In two hours we found nine Black Rhinos. Don&#39;t believe that
there are few mammals currently in the Park.

I was interested in James N&#34;dungu&#39;s comments on Common Sandpipers in
early July not being fresh migrants, I feel that these are genuine
visitors that may be failed breeders. If it were a case of
non-retournees then there should be an equal number of records in
June, and I have never seen one in that month. Could I trouble the
membership to check their records and see if they can locate Common
Sandpiper June records from Kenya. The first Wood Sandpipers and maybe
even early Green should be in the country now.

I am increasingly hearing of records that are not appearing in the
net. Whilst it seems a bit selfish not to take the trouble to share
them with the remainder who are regularly contributing, the net also
acts as a net for guaranteeing that the records are always available,
and not lost and forgotten.

Best to all

Brian
