Nature Kenya&#8217;s Wednesday morning birdwalk had another delightful outing at Windsor Golf and Country Club today 6th May. <I>Craibia brownii</I> trees throughout the remnant forest were piled high with clusters of honey-scented, rosy-white blossoms. African Darter on the pond, Brown-backed Scrub Robin in the forest, and African Golden Weavers nesting on the island in the pond.<BR>
<BR>
The surprise was a big bird with blue-green plumage, long tail and long yellow beak &#8211; a Yellowbill (aka Green Coucal or Green Malkoha). This bird is mainly found on the coast and in the western forests, and only occasionally passes through Nairobi.<BR>

Wishing you good birding, Fleur</SPAN></FONT>
