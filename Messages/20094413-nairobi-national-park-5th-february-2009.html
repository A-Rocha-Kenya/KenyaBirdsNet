  <pre>Dear All,
Another dry week, not only rain but the petrol shortage didn&#39;t help. I
visited Nairobi National Park, firstly visiting Ivory Burning Site.
Both Crested and Scaly Francolins were calling from the scrub, an
African Black Duck flew over, whilst long-term residents were still
present, two Iranias, at least five Nightingales, two Upcher&#39;s
Warblers, plus six Blackcaps and a Willow Warbler.  At the back of
Hyena Dam an African Water Rail was calling, and there was a single
phoenicuroides Red-tailed Shrike, whilst at the dam, a Saddle-billed
Stork, immature Great Cormorant, two sub-adult Fish Eagles, two
Eurasian Marsh Harriers and a migrant Black Kite. The circuit track
(8a) provided a male Pallid Harrier, three Lesser Kestrels, and the
strange sight of six Cinnamon-chested Buntings sitting in the one
small bush, with a number of others seen during the course of the day,
this does suggest some migratory pattern. The grassy plains beyond
&#34;the Beacon&#34; have been well eaten down by the abundant plains game,
and attracting larks. There were about fifteen Athi Short-toed Larks,
some of which were singing beautifully, with a number of Red-capped
and Fischer&#39;s Sparrowlarks.  Karen Primary School Dam held single Wood
and Green Sandpipers, and a number of Quailfinch coming in to drink.
There was also an isabellinus Red-tailed Shrike, a Lilac-breasted
Roller and a male Northern Wheatear at the junction to Ruai Dam.
Whilst here were a number of waterbirds at the dam, a Pink-backed
Pelican was the only bird of note. In the Athi Basin there was a
single White-tailed Lark on the approach road, and at the dam, two
adult Great Cormorants, a Steppe Eagle, twenty White and one immature
Open-billed Storks, three Northern Shoveler, the male having now
attained breeding plumage, the migrant waders consisted of twenty
Little Stints, a Temminck&#39;s Stint was heard but never found, three
Ruff, a rather exposed Common Snipe, ten Marsh Sandpipers, two
Greenshank, three Common and one Wood Sandpiper. The best of the
migrant waders though was a dapper Little Ringed Plover already in
full breeding plumage, and probably nothing to do with the four
immature birds that were there on 12th December last year.
Afrotropical waders included fifteen Black-winged Stilts and four
Spur-winged Plovers. There was an Olivaceous Warbler singing from the
depths of a flowering Acacia mellifera opposite the small island
favoured by the two crocodiles, a phoenicuroides Red-tailed Shrike,
but Red-throated Pipits were down to just two. Little was to be found
on the Rhino Circuit, three Lesser Masked Weavers being as good as it
got. Near Kingfisher Picnic Site there were three Northern Wheatears
on their territories, and five African Silverbills, the male Pied
Wheatear was at the picnic site. Leaving via Kisembe Forest, there was
a male Eurasian Marsh Harrier working the edge of the clearing, and a
Bat Hawk flew over the car, and disappeared from view. I was not able
to view it through the binoculars but jumped out of the car and got a
quick photograph before it disappeared. The first I have seen in the
Park. There was a pair of Nairobi Pipits on the exit road, a number of
Blackcaps were singing in the forest (it&#39;s not long now before most of
these will be gone), and finally a pair of Crowned Cranes on a nest on
the small dam. Barn Swallows were in very small numbers all day.
The mammal numbers appear to be still climbing, Zebras throughout, but
Wildebeeste numbers have certainly increased. Much of the plains game
is beyond Lone Tree and &#34;the Beacon&#34; and on the plains their is not
only numbers but an impressive variety of herbivores. Only one
Chandler&#39;s Reedbuck was seen on their &#34;patch&#34;, the best mammal for me
was an inquisitive Side-striped Ground-Squirrel below Baboon Cliffs.
It&#39;s still good, but even better for mammal enthusiasts.

Best to all

Brian
