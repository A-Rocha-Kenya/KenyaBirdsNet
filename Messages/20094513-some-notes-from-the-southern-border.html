  <pre>Dear All,
I went down towards Lake Natron with Richard and Ann Bishop this
weekend. We left on Saturday morning 24th and returned afternoon
Sunday 25th January. The journey down the Magadi Road, although we
didn&#39;t do any birding in the favoured areas, was to say the least
bleak, the whole region was very dry. Although we only crossed the
causeways at Lake Magadi, there were ample Chestnut-banded Plover
particularly this side of the Magadi Town barrier. Avocets were in
quite good numbers, and there were a lot of Lesser Flamingos. We
stayed at Sampu Camp, on a southern spur jutting out at right angles
from the Ngurumans. This is not very far from the Ewaso Nyiro
(southern), accessed by turning immediately left on to the Shompole
Road after crossing the bridge, then after a short distance taking a
right (signposed) track and follow the directions to the Camp. There
are about ten huge Hemmingway-style canvas tents, all new, as is the
furnishing, and inside flush toilet and shower. They have problems
getting the water to the tents, but assure this will be improved. The
beds were comfortable with fresh bedding, towels etc. Food is not
provided and must be brought down, however there is a kitchen, and a
huge mess/lounge tent. The cost per unit, is Ksh3000/night, and there
is an additional Ksh1500 p/p Conservation Fee. The place is run by the
Olkirimatian Group Ranch, and was set up with EEC funding. It is
spaciously set out along the ridge top, on one side overlooking the
seasonal river which was flowing healthily whilst we were there, the
other side looks out of the quite pristine acacia forest towards the
Shompole Plains and Lake Natron. There is an impressive 360o vista.
Ornithologically it was quite rich, a peculiar rather isolated
population of Bare-faced Go-Away Birds live around the camp, we had up
to three at one time drinking from the small artificial waterhole.
This is the farthest east that I have recorded the species in Kenya,
although in Tanzania they do extend east of the Rift. The most
abundant species by far was Swahili Sparrow, and the bird table just
became covered in them. Birds are fed several times a day, but the
species that we saw coming to be fed made up a very small list, whilst
the birds resident around the camp were varied.  In the mornings many
birds came to slake their thirsts, Black-faced Sandgrouse joined the
more abundant game birds and doves, Ruppell&#39;s Starlings and various
estrildids and weavers. African Cuckoos were a prominent part of the
dawn chorus as were Slender-tailed Nightjars and Heuglin&#39;s Coursers.
The most interesting species near the lodge was probably a Eurasian
Hoopoe, this is the furthest south that I have seen this palearctic
migrant in Kenya. There was not a large variety of mammals seen around
the camp, the staff claimed that Lion, Leopard and Cheetah had all
been to drink at he waterhole in the past twenty-four hour period, but
the only cat evidence we had were noisy Lions at night. Seeing
Dik-Diks coming in to drink was an unusual sight. To make reservation
for Sampu Camp, bookings can be made at P.O. Box 3, Magadi, or more
expediently on a mobile; Joel Tonkei 0723 884940.

Whilst there we paid a visit to the mind-blowing Shompole Lodge, we
located Southern Black Bishops near one of the swimming pools, but
they were in non-breeding dress, as the region had been very dry and
unsuitable for breeding. They appear to vacate the plains and conceal
themselves along the escarpment. Possibly they don&#39;t leave the region
at all, but they are certainly very inconspicuous when not breeding. I
wonder what happens to them in Tanzania during the non-breeding
season.
At present the resident rate for the unashamedly super-luxurious
Shompole is Ksh19000 per person per night full board, but we are
advised that very soon there will be a reduction for residents, maybe
down to Ksh12000. Bookings can be made direct on email to
RESERVATIONS@THEARTOFADVENTURES.COM there is a Phone Number +254 714
271952.
There were a few mammals out on the plains, there were the usual
Zebra, Wildebeest, and a selection of other antelopes including
Fringe-eared Oryx. We also saw Bat-eared Fox when driving back to
Sampu. There was a heavy rain on the Saturday evening, perhaps not
lasting much more than an hour, and by early next morning the ground
had drunk in all the water and there was no evidence of the shower
left. We also had a shower below Kisamese on the return, so maybe we
can look forward to some precipitation again.

I have just received the latest Swara.  From the joint standards of
professional layout/production and most interesting and absorbing
novel articles when under the superb Editorialship of Gordon Boy,
which placed Swara amongst the best if not the best African Natural
History journal in existence, it has in such a short space of time
fallen to a very dull, absolutely colourless, political, doom and
gloom rag with none of the exciting and interesting Natural History
articles in it, that we all used to look forward to.. or maybe it&#39;s
just me!

Some other interesting events recently, that seem to have been missed
through not being reported although I only have these by word of mouth
and I have no dates. recently a lone Wild Dog near the Langata
Entrance of Nairobi National Park, and a pair of Pel&#39;s Fishing Owls
roosting in front of Governor&#39;s Camp in the Mara.

Dave Richards wrote to me saying that whilst he was birding in the
Ivory Burning Site in Nairobi National Park, he found himself facing a
lioness, so it is best to exercise some caution and not get too
complacent when birding in the Picnic areas.

Best to all

Brian
