  <pre>Dear All,

Rupert Watson, Nigel Hunter and myself met at the Main Entrance of
Nairobi National Park at 6.45am on 13th June 2009. It was quite a
bright morning, no sign of rain, but the recent rain had left the
place very green and lush. All the dams apart from Athi were full,
some to the brim. Athi basin has obviously been short changed in the
precipiation department, and although the islands have disappeared,
there is still a long way to go, and at the present state it will not
last the coming dry season. The river was the most alarming less than
a foot deep at the bridge at the Hippo Pools, and this is June!
There was little along the entrance apart from a Suni, and also
nothing of any note at Ivory Burning Site, the best being a Brown
Parisoma. Along the back road there was a single Laughing Dove, more
associated with the drier southern portion of the Park. Hyena Dam had
but the resident African Jacana. The adjacent grassy plains had
several singing White-tailed Larks, and they were present throughout
the grassland down to Athi Basin where strangely none were seen. There
was a scattering of Rosy-breasted Longclaws with several seen apart
from here. The run-off had calling Red-chested Flufftail and African
Water Rail, whilst the surrounding meadow had a staggering two-hundred
dazzling Yellow-crowned Bishops, by far the largest group I have seen
in the Park. Only a few Cardinal Queleas were here, and amongst the
Red-billed Queleas was a single all red-bellied male, most attractive.
A surprise here was a very late adult Barn Swallow which having found
us, just flew around and around the vehicle. Widowbirds were in
extraordinary numbers, up to two-thousand White-winged, four-hundred
Jackson&#39;s but only some fifty Red-collared. Most were in these
northern parts, but small numbers were found throughout the Park.
There were a few Quailfinch here and elsewhere, and over a dozen
dazzling Zebra Waxbill. The first of over half-a-dozen Diederic
Cuckoos were seen, they were far more conspicuous than usual. Along
the road to Olmanyi Dam were a skulking Serval, six Kori Bustards and
a Crimson-rumped Waxbill, whilst two Namaqua Doves were seen in the
northern parts, usually another species associated with the southern
end. Towards Kingfisher Picnic Site was a single adult male Parasitic
Weaver, and a Rock Martin sitting on dead branches with Lesser Striped
Swallows. Whilst Rock Martins are quite a common sight in the Park,
unlike other hirundines they are not usually seen perched. Looking
closer at this individual it seemed much greyer than normal, but might
be an immature. Incredibly in other parts, another bird was seen on
dead branches and a third sitting on the road. All were greyer than
the usual dark brown individuals. At Kingfisher was a Levaillant&#39;s
Cuckoo and nearby a solitary Saddle-billed Stork. At the dam on the
edge of Kisembe Forest was the currently resident though elusive
Madagascar Pond Heron, a second African Jacana and a pair of Nairobi
Pipits. Karen Primary School Dam had attracted what appears to be the
only Little Grebe in the Park, they have not come in this season, and
Ruai Dam some twenty more Yellow-crowned Bishops. There were over
forty Mottled Swifts coming in to drink at Embakasi Dam, with the
commoner swift species, but the full dam had not attracted any
waterbirds. Athi Dam was extremely disappointing, no visiting ducks
only a handful of Yellow-billed Storks and African Spoonbills. Singles
of Pink-backed Pelican, Black-crowned Night-Heron, Spur-winged Plover,
and Yellow-throated Sandgrouse. The annuals on the flats were hiding
over fifty Fischer&#39;s Sparrowlarks. Along the Mbagathi, Violet
Woodhoopoes were calling, and three were seen at the Hippo Pools where
there were six Hippos now and the guards say there have been up to
eight. There was a Dusky Turtle-Dove here, which was a bit out of
place, also single Pygmy Kingfisher and Mountain Wagtail, as whilst
there was a lot of activity, it belonged to  the usual residents of
the area. We had a second Serval not far from Leopard Cliffs and very
close to there a single young male Lion.
Only a month now to the first of the returning palearctics (waders),
the Park is at present still a rewarding visit, although there has
been a considerable drop in the number of mammals although the variety
is still there.

Best to all

Brian
