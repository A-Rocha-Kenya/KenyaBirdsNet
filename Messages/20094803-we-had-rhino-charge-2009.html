  <pre>This year&#39;s Rhino Charge was in the foothills of the Tugen hills on the way to Kabarnet. Rain had fallen and although most luggas were dry there waere a few with some water in them. Heavily over grazed by thousands of goats and quite heavily populated by humans despite the harshness of the habitat, the bird life was nevertheless quite interesting.
There were lots of Brown Parrots feeding on fruiting riverine trees. Vitelline Masked Weavers were common and busy nest building. Eastern Violet Backed, Marico and Beautiful Sunbirds were feeding on flowering acacias. White-winged (White- browed) Scrub- Robins were in good voice as were Red Fronted Tinkerbirds, Black Cuckoos and Grey wren Warblers. We saw Shikra and Pygmy Falcon but no large birds of prey.
The 2 most interesting records were a single Madagascar Bee eater on the way into our camp and a single, shy Stripe-breasted Seedeater on the aloe covered slopes of one of the rocky hills....before the cars came!
