<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dear Birders,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Walk on Sat 15th August took us to Huseini Car 
Track in Nguu Tatu.&nbsp; We have not been to this area for some time as it was 
fenced off but there is now a gap in the fence as cars are using it again and I 
have a written permission from the owner to birdwatch there.&nbsp; The first 
bird we saw on arrival was a magnificent Black Chested Snake Eagle. He flew over 
slowly for some time, riding the air currents so we all got a good view of him 
(or her).&nbsp; This is a favourite area for this bird. The area is amazingly 
dry considering we have had lots of intermittent heavy showers.&nbsp; We went 
straight to the pond which is now devoid of children bathing thank 
goodness.&nbsp; Birds of note:&nbsp;&nbsp;2 Juvenile Allen's Gallinules leapt up 
out of the reeds, fast disapearing not to be seen again.&nbsp;&nbsp;Juveniles we 
have not seen here, adults we have seen so can one presume they are breeding at 
this pond?&nbsp; It was actually the first time I had ever seen juveniles and I 
was not so smart at recognising them immediately as they are so different from 
the adult.&nbsp; Zimmerman has the best illus. and once I checked there was no 
doubt.&nbsp; Fortunately we had a very good close-up view of them. Other birds 
of note Madagascar Squacco Heron perched in a tree but obliging us by flying 
round a couple of times, Slender Tailed Nightjar flushed from under our feet, 
many Grosbeak and Golden Palm Weavers and Zanzibar Red Bishops nesting in the 
reeds with one or two Fan Tailed Widow birds seen briefly.&nbsp; A Knob Billed 
Duck flew over (rare for here) Pink Backed Pelicans flying over, A Yellow Bill 
in the tree together with a male Black Headed Batis, a Purple Heron flying by, 
African Black Crake and a Common Moorhen in the reeds, a flock of Namaqua Doves 
passing by obviously off to roost at sunset.&nbsp; No migrants yet, not even a 
Barn Swallow.&nbsp; There were also large flocks of Red Billed Quelea feeding on 
the dried grass and in the trees.&nbsp; 30 species in total, not bad for a 
couple of hours and all around one small half-dried-up pond!&nbsp; Birds can 
always surprise us. &nbsp;Feel welcome to join us any 3rd Sat. in the month if 
you are in Mombasa.&nbsp; (Marlene Reid)</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Birdflash:&nbsp; A sad note is that the Verreaux 
Eagle Owl being reared at the gate of Nguuni Nature Park was killed by Indian 
House Crows.&nbsp; He/she was half grown and had been living half in and half 
out of the cage to try to rehabituate but the crows made a determined attack and 
inflicted nasty neck injuries so the owl died.&nbsp; We had all become so used 
to seeing him/her so great sadness!&nbsp; Stone those crows!</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Hadada Ibis which nest in the garden next to 
mine seem to have successfully reared 2 young which are now nearly fully 
grown.&nbsp; The last time I think they fell prey to the Great 
Sparrowhawk.&nbsp; They are so wonderful (even considering the noise they make 
from about 5 a.m.) especially when they perch on the roof at 
sunset.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The resident African Goshawk (female) visited my 
verandah yesterday afternoon to scoop a lizard off the wall, gave me quite a 
shock!</FONT></DIV></BODY></HTML>
