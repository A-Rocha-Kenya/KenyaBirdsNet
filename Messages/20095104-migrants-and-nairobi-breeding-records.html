A sunny day at the University of Nairobi&#8217;s Agricultural Field Station at Loresho Ridge provided Nature Kenya&#8217;s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk with a wide range of birds. Eurasian Bee-eaters, Willow Warblers, Blackcaps and a Garden Warbler represented the migrants. Residents included African Cuckoo Hawk, Red-chested Cuckoo, Red-throated Wryneck and Brown-backed Woodpecker. Three African Open-billed Storks were seen flying over.<BR>
<BR>
Young birds begging from adults in my Nairobi garden now include Brown-backed Woodpecker, Olive Thrush and Variable Sunbird.<BR>

Wishing you good birding, Fleur</SPAN></FONT>
