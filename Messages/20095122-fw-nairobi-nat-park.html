<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dear All,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Just to report that on sunny afternoon on 16th 
July&nbsp;in the Park one Whinchat along the watercourse from Hyena 
dam.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also two pairs Secretary birds, male and female Saddle Bills 
and pair of crowned crane with one youngster.&nbsp;&nbsp;Large flocks of common 
Quelea at Karen Primary School Dam but no sign of the yellow crowned 
bishops.&nbsp;&nbsp; Large flocks of white winged widow birds but no sign of 
Jacksons throughout the area.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Yesterday,20th,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on a brief 
overcast afternoon visit to the Park, no sign of the winchat but we saw a 
Madagascar Squacco on the dam near Kisembe Forest, which we have seen before in 
that area.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The white winged Widow birds were again present but 
in smaller numbers.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>One splendid Martial eagle by the Nag. Dam. 
</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>On 16th July we&nbsp;were very sad to see that the 
Epaulette bats have been BANISHED&nbsp;from the KWS main gate park entrance 
roof.&nbsp;&nbsp;(A tracery of 'bat&nbsp;proof' wires have been strung across 
the entire under-roof canopy).&nbsp; &nbsp;We wonder whether this was really 
necessary as they were of&nbsp;great interest and quite 
unusual.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
