Some updates on birding sites near Nairobi.<BR>
<BR>
Oloolua Forest, at the end of Karen Road, is managed by the Institute for Primate Research of the National Museums of Kenya. You can go birding along the Nature Trail by paying an entrance fee at the gate. Nature Kenya members, bring your ID and membership card.<BR>
<BR>
Brackenhurst International Conference Centre in Tigoni has a nature trail and a coffee shop. Birders should book ahead with Anne Maingi (Guest Relations Manager), or Rachel at reception, through &lt;bookings@brackenhurst.com&gt; or phone 020 2014092 / 2013162 or 0724-256721 or 0736-424242. You can also drop in without booking, but in that case there may be an entrance charge.<BR>
<BR>
Manguo Birders, a community conservation group, are protecting and managing Manguo Wetland in Limuru off the Nairobi-Nakuru road. They are associated with the Wetlands office of the National Museums of Kenya. The group have fenced the wetland and built a boardwalk and viewing platform, which will be great viewing when the wetland fills. Currently, entry to the viewing platform is free.<BR>
