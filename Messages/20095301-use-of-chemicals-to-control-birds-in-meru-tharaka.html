  <pre>hi all and happy new year,2009. today there was an announcement on the radio about the control of certain species of birds by use of chemicals in meru and its environs.to me i think they are targeting Queleas or do anybody know which birds they are targeting?,my questions are, do they know the effects of this chemicals on other birds species?what about animals and insects and the entire eco-system?we as stakeholders we should raise this questions, what do you think? for the sake of birds. thanks all, moses
