style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Palatino Linotype'; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">A 
belated review of a trip made by Sarah Alsbury, Julia Bracewell, Paul Buckley 
and David Hutton between 9 and 23 November. We made the trip through the 
excellent and efficient services of Joseph Mwangi of NaturesWonderland Safaris 
and we&#8217;ll place a trip report on their website 
(www.natureswonderlandsafaris.com) in due course. <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB 
style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Palatino Linotype'; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">We 
left Nairobi on Monday 9<SUP>th</SUP> and sailed past the endless traffic jams 
on Thika Road to the Thika sewage ponds.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>An excellent introduction to wetland birds with good numbers of common 
ducks seen along with a few migrants such as Garganey, Ruff and Wood and Marsh 
sandpiper.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>We then sped off 
to Wajee and managed good views of a small group of Hinde&#8217;s Babblers and the 
only Cinnamon Bracken Warbler and Yellow-bellied waxbill of the trip.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Too little time at the marvellous 
Mountain Lodge but we saw a few upland species. A cuckoo hawk in a tree outside 
the breakfast room took top billing and some of us got brief views of Jackson&#8217;s 
Francolin the following morning.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Eastern Bronze-naped Pigeon, Red-fronted Parrot<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>and Crowned Eagle were other spectacular 
species.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB 
style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Palatino Linotype'; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Two 
days at Buffalo Springs and Samburu followed.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The rain must have made a huge 
difference there although Samburu was still pretty dry.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Excellent mammals and birds all round 
including Heuglins and Somali courser, Swallow-tailed Kite and good numbers of 
Somali Bee-eater.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We saw Pygmy 
Falcon, Red-fronted Warbler and Black-bellied sunbird and Cuckoos included 
Klaas, Jacobin and Black. Migrants included a single Upcher&#8217;s Warbler and 
Nightingale. PB was surprised not to see a single Yellow-billed hornbill, a 
species he recorded as common on a previous visit in the mid 1990s, nor did we 
manage a single cheetah.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>An 
Aardwolf was the most interesting mammal.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB

style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Palatino Linotype'; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">North 
of Mt Kenya we saw a nice group of Straw-tailed Wydah, Steel-blue Wydah and 
Village Indigobird.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>At Naro Moro, a 
brief look included Green-headed, Tacazze and Northern double collared 
sunbird.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Then a long trek to 
Baringo the following day stopping for the Mackinders Eagle site and seeing a 
few additional highland species including Black-winged Plover and Golden-winged 
sunbird.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Palatino Linotype'; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Two 
nights at Baringo were productive completing our set of Eagle owls with Greyish 
and Verrauxs as well as African Scops and white faced Scops.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>Other species included 
Blue-cheeked Bee-eater, Northern Grey Tit, Brown Babbler, Golden-backed Weaver 
as well as Hemprichs and Jacksons Hornbills, and close views of Slender-tailed 
Nightjar.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The boat trip offered 
obliging and hungry fish eagles and several Senegal Thick-knee.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The bird table at Baringo Club was 
spectacular with exceptionally close views of around 15 species &#8211; including 
three species of Masked Weavers.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Palatino Linotype'; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">We 
stayed at the excellent Flamingo Camp just outside Nakuru.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Flamingo numbers substantially down on 
the same time last year but eagles included Great Spotted and Steppe.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>A small flock of Grey-crested helmet 
shrikes was observed below Baboon rocks where little rock thrush, mocking cliff 
chat and hildebrandt&#8217;s francolin were all seen<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB

style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Palatino Linotype'; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Several 
Kori Bustard on the way in to Mara and numbers of White-bellied and 
black-bellied were high throughout. A large passage of many hundreds of White 
Stork, a few Black and Openbill and Abdims also.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Several groups of European hobby were 
also recorded plus a few rollers and montagu&#8217;s and pallid harriers. A good third 
day not only recorded all three big cats but they were all actually active &#8211; 
even the lions!<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Failure to see a 
single<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Ground hornbill was 
disappointing.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Numbers of 
White-backed and Lappet-faced Vulture seemed not bad considering news of 
declines though we saw just a few Ruppell&#8217;s and a single White-headed here.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>On the way out of the park we saw Double 
Banded Courses and an astonishingly obliging Lanner Falcon eating insects on the 
ground.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB

a quiet few days on the coast with a day visit to Arabuko and Mida Creek ably 
assisted by Jonathan Manchongo of the Arabuko-Sokoke Guides Association.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The forest was fairly quiet but we had 
an excellent range of species in the forest such as Green and Brown-breasted 
barbet, Amani Sunbird, Scaly-throated Honeyguide, Scaly babbler and Northern 
Carmine Bee-eater while Lizard Buzzard and Bohm&#8217;s Spinetail were nice to see 
just outside of the forest. </SPAN></FONT></DIV></BODY></HTML>
