<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>In inclement weather Haller Park provides a good 
venue, not so far from Mombasa and always something to see, especially when 
there are no migrants around.&nbsp; I had actually been there the previous Sat 
due to me getting bird walk days mixed up but deciding to go anyway, needing to 
get away from a houseful of visitors. Had met with Samson the park guide where 
we had a magnificent walk in the pouring rain, seeing all the herons and 
egrets.&nbsp; The best view of a Goliath I had in a long time, Purple, Green 
Backed, Black Corwned Night, Grey and Black Headed. Intermediate, Little 
and&nbsp;Great White Egrets.&nbsp; On a wet day this is the place to see the 
herons and egrets!&nbsp; On a drier bird walk day, we had to make do with Grey, 
one Black Crowned Night and several Green Backed herons, Little, Great White and 
Intermediate Egrets.&nbsp; A single Crested Crane which would seem to have lost 
its mate and itself having an injured leg!&nbsp; A hazard from either a 
crocodile or a large monitor lizard.&nbsp; A lovely African Fish&nbsp; 
Eagle,&nbsp; a Woolly Necked and a Yellow Billed Stork.&nbsp; Egyptian Geese 
which had 4 young on the previous Sat. seemed to be childless, probably monitors 
again. Village and Golden Palm Weavers busy nesting.&nbsp; Nothing else of note 
except the crocodile which had climbed into the boat.&nbsp; Hopefully&nbsp;the 
boat&nbsp;will not be needed any time soon as I understand the 
crocodiles&nbsp;had just had a feed and he/she was obviously intending to sleep 
it off.&nbsp; Welcome to Mombasa Bird Walk, every 3rd Sat. in the month.&nbsp; 
Call to check meeting time 0720 949195 (Marlene Reid)</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>P.S.&nbsp; Tudor Creek, an African Harrier Hawk, 
hopefully raiding the crows nests but unfortunately more likely raiding the nest 
of the Hadada Ibis.&nbsp; First time I have ever seen it here.
