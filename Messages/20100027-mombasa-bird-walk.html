<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dear Birders,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Late again with the write-up.&nbsp; Sat. 20th March 
tried to see migrant waders at a place called Jamboree but too much water and no 
birds so trekked to Bamburi Central Quarry where we had some magnificent 
birding.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Lots of heronsand egrets, but the most impressive 
were the Diomorphic both white and dark grey phase and seemingly not very 
tolerant of each other.&nbsp; White phase constantly trying to chase the grey 
phase away although both tolerant of other herons and egrets.&nbsp; Great 
numbers of Greenshank and Long Tailed Cormorants, a couple of Common Moorhens 
but amazing Purple Swamphens, easily seen as they foraged in the reeds.&nbsp; 
These birds are such a vibrant colour and especially in the late afternoon 
sun.&nbsp; Bur by far away the best sighting of the day were the two pairs of 
African Darter both with nests, one nest having a juvenile bird, showing itself, 
standing upright on the edge of the nest and the other nest having a brownish 
baby poking its head out of the nest for feeding by a parent bird.&nbsp; The 
nests were in the middle of all the Cormorants but easily visible from the 
opposite side of the lake where we were standing.&nbsp; This was such a 
treat!&nbsp; We could hardly drag ourselves away.&nbsp; Am hoping to get some 
pictures.&nbsp; Other birds of note, a lone Common Squacco Heron, Mosque 
Swallows flying over and lots of Yellow Wagtails on the playing fields.&nbsp; 
Barn Swallows seem to have left.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>One interesting thing re: Indian House Crows - over 
Xmas I saw an IHC with lots of white on it up at Kikambala, white wings and 
chest and very pale head.&nbsp; Two days ago I saw an IHC fly past my verandah 
with white wings.&nbsp;&nbsp;Albino or a strange disease (hopefully restricted 
to crows and lethal)&nbsp; Anybody else seen any?&nbsp; The white is really 
brilliant white. </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Enjoy your birding&nbsp; (Marlene Reid -
