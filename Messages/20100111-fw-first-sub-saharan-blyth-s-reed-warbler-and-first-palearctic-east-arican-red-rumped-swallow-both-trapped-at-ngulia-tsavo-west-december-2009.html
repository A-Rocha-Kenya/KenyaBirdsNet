SO<BR><BR><BR>FIRST SUB-SAHARAN BLYTH’S REED WARBLER AND FIRST EAST AFRICAN<BR>RED-RUMPED SWALLOW, BOTH TRAPPED AT NGULIA, TSAVO WEST DECEMBER 2009.<BR><BR><BR>Dear All,<BR>The news has not been released by any of the members attached to the<BR>Ngulia Ringing Group, and rather
 than wait any longer…. There was a<BR>Blyth’s Reed Warbler caught at Ngulia on 19th December. This bird was<BR>well examined (naturally) and relevant images taken. I believe it<BR>represents the first sub-saharan record ever and is a very exciting<BR>record, also of much interest at the same period they caught the first<BR>ever palearctic Red-rumped Swallow recorded in East Africa. The bird<BR>is very distinctive when compared to our local race, with a pale buff<BR>face, and this individual had an almost whitish rump.<BR>The two most exciting Kenyan migrants in 2009.<BR>Best to all<BR>Brian<BR></DIV></DIV></DIV><!-- cg30.c2.mail.ac4.yahoo.com compressed/chunked Sun Dec 27 05:53:14 PST 2009 --></div></body></html>
