  <pre>In October last year I was at Island Camp, L Baringo, and photographed 
this weaver among a load of others. Looking at it again in the photo I 
haven&#39;t a clue what it is - any ideas anyone? As far as I can tell there 
aren&#39;t any black-headed weavers with a pale bill. In fact the only 
pale-billed adult male weaver I can think of immediately is Dark-backed 
which this is definitely not. Anyone aware of paleness in bills that can 
occur as a result of anything else (disease?). Brian - you&#39;ve had a wide 
experience with odd weavers and have plenty of photos - have you seen 
anything like this? Dieter?
