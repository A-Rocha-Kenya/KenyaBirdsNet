An egg on the ground, and next to it, some fluff, like grass seed heads or sweepings under the bed &#8211; a nightjar chick.<BR>
<BR>
The nightjar (presumably a Montane Nightjar) was accidentally flushed in the rocky outcrops with seasonal wetlands on the hillside between the Ivory Burning site and the fence in the northern corner of Nairobi National Park, as we carried out a survey of the special plants of small seasonal wetlands in the park.<BR>
<BR>
We quickly left the nest site so that the adult could return. Later we found two eggs in a more precarious site just off the road a little before the stone bench near the fence. <BR>

Wishing you good birding, Fleur</SPAN></FONT>
