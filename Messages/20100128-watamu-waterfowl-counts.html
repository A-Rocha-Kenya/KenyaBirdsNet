  <pre>These were done last weekend and went very well with over 20 
participants and with the usual invaluable support from Turtle Bay Beach 
Club which provided a minibus and packed lunches for us all. We covered 
all the main sites - Sabaki, Kensalt saltworks, Mida, Chemchem, Jilore, 
Bartum and Malindi Harbour. Highlights in brief for the w/e were the 
most Eurasian Oystercatchers I&#39;ve seen together ever in Kenya - four at 
Mida, Eurasian Marsh Harrier at Lake Bartum and another at Jilore, 
reasonable numbers of Broad-billed Sandpipers at Sabaki (totals to 
come...), a Common Snipe at Sabaki which is one of the first I&#39;ve seen 
there for several years, a Booted Eagle over the saltworks (ok - not 
exactly a waterbird, but nice to see and again not one I&#39;ve seen many of 
down here), eight Purple Swamphens at Chemchem - and given the area of 
reeds there, I would not be surprised if there in fact nearer on 50 or 
60 in there in fact; a single Sand Martin at Sabaki and pairs of African 
Pygmy Goose at Bartum and Chemchem.

Thanks to all those who participated - it&#39;s a very hot and exhausting 
count especially five hours on Sabaki! Thanks too to NatureKenya, 
Jonathan Baya and A Rocha Kenya who together with Turtle Bay pitched in 
and provided transport without which it would have been totally impossible.
