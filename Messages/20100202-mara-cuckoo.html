One of or guys has recently photographed this cuckoo in the Mara.
My sense is that it is a near adult Red-chested (reason for lacking the
yellow in the bill/eye?). There is not much clarity on the gabonensis
race of Black Cuckoo ito what an intergrade might look like. I don&#39;t see
the rufous really covering the throat.

Do you know much about the gabonensis race?
Thanks
Alastair

Hello all, 

Hope this mail finds you well. 

I need some help in identifying the bird in the pictures attached. There
has been a bit of a debate as to whether it is a juv. Red chested Cuckoo
or a Black Cuckoo! There is however mention from Sinclair as to a sub
species of the Black Cuckoo in W Africa that looks similar and has been
recorded venturing into E Africa. 

Any help will be much appreciated! 

Thanks

Niall
