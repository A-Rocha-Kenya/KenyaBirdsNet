To celebrate World Bird Festival, a bird walk at the Nairobi National Museum on October 2 featured a Jacaranda tree dripping with sunbirds, a pair of Black-backed Puffbacks feeding a young one, and Cinnamon-chested Bee-eaters enjoying a sun bath, lying flat in a pool of red dust, wings and tail spread and beak open.<BR>

On October 3 Mike Davidson, Mike Plagens, Christina Murray, Martha Nzisa and myself spent seven hours birding in Nairobi National Park. Highlights among the 101 bird species seen were a pair of Ostriches with 16 small chicks, migrants such as Common, Green and Wood Sandpiper, Common Greenshank, Northern and Isabelline Wheatears and Spotted Flycatcher, flocks of Violet-backed Starlings feeding on the Rhus natalensis berries at the Ivory burning site, and a couple of Rosy-breasted Longclaws in the grassland. A moorhen (sub-adult Common or unusually bold Lesser?) is still being scrutinized. Seven lions on the move were an added bonus.<BR>
<BR>
On Nature Kenya&#8217;s Wednesday morning birdwalk today October 6, at the University of Nairobi Agricultural Field Station in Loresho (Lower Kabete), we recorded another remarkable 70+ species, including flocks of Eurasian Bee-eaters and Chestnut Weavers, a small flock of Yellow-crowned Canaries, and a singing Black-crowned Tchagra. The is the only site we visit in Nairobi where we find the Black-crowned Tchagra.<BR>

Wishing you good birding, Fleur<BR>
