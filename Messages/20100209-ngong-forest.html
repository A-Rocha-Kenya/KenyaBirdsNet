  <pre>I had a very pleasant ,oxygen full, 2 hours in the forest this morning
with senior ranger Nicholas who is improving a lot with his bird
knowledge.
We went to see the Crowned Eagle nest which has been &#39; highjacked &#39; by 2
White -bakced Vulutres . They are clearly nesting there but Nicholas
tells me the Eagle still comes around there !
Had a great view of a Narina Trogon
