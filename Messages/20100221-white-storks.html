  <pre>another report in these .
The Hopcrafts who have a farm on the north shore of Lake Naivasha, just
below green park , told us that there were upto 1000 White Storks in
their fields last week .
Heather , Karen and I went to see, on Friday . We saw upto 300 around
the farm and I am sure there were more on the thermals . The migration
trek from Southern Africa , has got stop overs here !
A great sight 

Hopcrafts also reported seeing upto 100 Seckled Pigeons in one of their
fields together recently
