<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Bird walk Sat. 20th Feb was to the new and still 
developing, prestigious Vipingo Golf complex, off the Malindi-Mombasa 
road.&nbsp; We now have an enthusiastic fellow birder living up there and so it 
is interesting to keep in touch and to make periodic visits to see how the bird 
life is coming in to roost so to speak!</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The golf course is really majestic with grass like 
velvet, all grown from seed and transplanted in squares, a great joy to the many 
hundreds of Yellow Wagtails, the most numerous bird but unfortunately Indian 
House Crows coming a close second despite the ongoing and enthusiastic 
trapping.&nbsp; The ponds and streams are attracting some waders, not in great 
numbers, but in ones and twos, namely Common and Wood Sandpipers.&nbsp; An 
African Jacana has taken up residency on one of the waterways and we 
were&nbsp;told that there are&nbsp;swallows nesting under the small 
bridges.&nbsp; Black Headed Herons abound as do Long Tailed Cormorants.&nbsp; 
Unfortunately the large natural dam is very deep and with no wading space so 
only Cormorants there.&nbsp; A second dam under construction will, hopefully, 
under the eagle eye of our resident birder, incorporate a wading area.&nbsp; 
Woolly Necked Storks flew overhead and a single Fish Eagle.&nbsp; A flock of 
Violet Backed Starlings in one of the big trees and a small flock of White 
Throated bee-eaters.&nbsp; Other migrants were Eurasian Orioles in the garden at 
the admin. centre, quite a few Spotted Flycatchers, in fact the most I have seen 
this year in one place!&nbsp; Hundreds of Barn Swallows dipping in the 
pools.&nbsp; Plenty of Black Capped Tchagras calling and other more common 
birds, all totalling 25 in the 2 hours we were there. This is a massive site, in 
the words of one of the birders "like something off a film set"!&nbsp; Still a 
lot of distrubance especially with the building of the airstrip but hopefully 
with all the waterways, surrounding scrub, large indigenous trees&nbsp;and 
gardens it will eventually become a great birding area, hopefully on the scale 
of the Windsor Golf and Country Club! &nbsp; Wishing you all happy birding.
