<BR>
A sparkling morning followed by thunderstorms rolling down from the mountains, a warm welcome from Lake Elmenteita Lodge and thousands of feeding waterbirds made Nature Kenya&#8217;s Sunday Birdwalk truly spectacular.<BR>
<BR>
Lake Elmenteita has risen from its low in December, but is still filling slowly. The eastern and southern shores, where we were, were thick with water birds. We saw thousands of Lesser Flamingo, Ruff and Little Stint; a hundred or more Hottentot Teal, Pied Avocet and Black-winged Stilt; many Ringed Plover, Kittlitz&#8217;s Plover and White-winged Black Tern; hundreds of White Storks on the other side of the lake and two Black Storks circling overhead. It was breathtaking.<BR>

Wishing you good birding, Fleur</SPAN></FONT>
