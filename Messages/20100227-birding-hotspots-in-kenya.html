  <pre>Greetings,
Firstly, many thanks to those who responded to my appeal for articles and photos for the Kenya Birding magazine.  We still need a few more articles - so if you are mulling over an idea - let me know asap.

********************************************

Birding Hotspots in Kenya

Background:

This is a publication that Nature Kenya has been planning for quite a while - initiated as part of the tourism project in 2008. Brian Finch is lead author. Gordon Boy has more recently taken on the editing and has put a great deal of thinking behind what will be an outstanding publication.

It will be a full colour A5 booklet consisting of 48 of Kenya&#39;s best known birding sites.  Most of the booklet will be one or two page descriptions with two photos (one scenic/habitat, one birdy)

What is needed:

To complete this publication we need more contributors and habitat photos.  If you decide to contribute you will receive credit for that description (or photo) in the publication.

The task: depending on the site - an advisory of about 90 words and a description of about 210 words. (If you are familiar with a site the challenge will be to keep your description short.)

Interested? Send me a line and I&#39;ll send you the list of sites that still require descriptions and a detailed guide done by Gordon of what he requires.

Deadline for submissions: 20 April

Please note: the material in the booklet will also be used in other places - like online.

Best wishes,
Catherine Ngarachu
