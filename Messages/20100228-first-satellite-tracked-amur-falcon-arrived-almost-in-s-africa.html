<BR>
The first adult female Amur Falcon with satellite tag no. 95773 has almost reached the South African border in Zimbawe. It spent the night of 27/28 November in southern Zimbabwe (21.514 S/ 29.995 E) some 75 km from the border of S. Africa. Two more females are on their way to S. Africa in East and Central Africa. They migrate further inland than we would have expected,&nbsp; one of them crossing Lake Malawi. The other bird is near Lake Tanganyika.<BR>
<BR>
While one adult male is still in Eastern India the other has almost reached the African coast south of Sokotra crossing the Indian Ocean.<BR>
