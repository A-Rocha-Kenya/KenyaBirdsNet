<p>The following is a four-part trip report following 4-days of full birding
with my client Steve Williams. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The dates
were 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup>; 24<sup>th</sup> and 27<sup>th</sup>
February, 2010. A per site totals were 120, 34 and 45 bird species
respectively. The overall trip’s tally was 218 species represented in 55 bird
families.</p>

<p> &nbsp;</p> 

<p>Due to time constrains and to reduce the reading time, I will only give trip
highlights, breeding and any other interesting records only. For fuller report
and trip-list records, please, do not hesitate to contact me directly.</p>

<p> &nbsp;</p> 

<p>On 20<sup>th</sup> February, Nairobi National Park (NNP) was the place to
be. Following overnight rains, the weather was cool and partially cloudy most
of the day. Late afternoon sunny spells maximized the birding and game-viewing hours.
Some of the mammals included: Buffaloes, Common Zebras, Bushbucks, Elands,
Maasai Giraffes, Black-faced Vervet Monkeys, Olive Baboons, Black Rhinos, and a
single Reedbuck. Serrated Terrapins, Nile Crocodiles and Hippopotamus added a
flavour too.</p>

<p> &nbsp;</p> 

<p>NNP’s breeding records came from the Grey-crowned Crane (sitting on eggs
near the Kingfisher picnic site), while, the White-browed Sparrow Weaver were
collecting grass-materials and building nests. Immature of the following
species were recorded - Augur Buzzard <b style=""><i style="">c.1</i></b>, Emerald-spotted Wood Dove <b style=""><i style="">c.1</i></b>,
Rufous Sparrow, and the African White-backed Vulture <b style=""><i style="">c.20</i></b>. The Cattle Egret
and Wattled Starling were in full breeding dresses. A thrilling courtship
display by a pair of the Kori Bustard and Grey-crowned Cranes was out-of-this
world!</p>

<p> &nbsp;</p> 

<p>Other particular interesting records were the sightings of the Parasitic
Weaver and the <span style="">Levaillant's Cuckoo. The
migrants from the northern hemisphere included: Common Rock Thrush, Northern
and Pied Wheatears, Common and the Green Sandpiper, Barn Swallow, Red-tailed
Shrike and the Eurasian Bee-eater. Diurnal raptors were: Lesser Kestrel <b style=""><i style="">c.1</i></b>,
Steppe Eagle <b style=""><i style="">c.1</i></b>, Eurasian Marsh Harrier <b style=""><i style="">c.1</i></b> and the Common
Kestrel <b style=""><i style="">c.25.</i></b> </span></p> 

<p><span style=""> &nbsp;</span></p> 

<p><span style="">Other additional included the Marabou
Stork <b style=""><i style="">c.200</i></b>, Black Kite <b style=""><i style="">c.15</i></b>, Tawny Eagle <b style=""><i style="">c.5</i></b>,
Chestnut Weaver, African Paradise Flycatcher, African Pygmy Kingfisher and the
Quail-Finch.</span></p><p><br></p><p>Thanks to my son Castro Ndung'u (who was a good spotter) and George Ndung'u, a trainee-bird-guide from the Nyahururu Bird Club (NBC) who joined us during the expedition.<br><span style=""></span></p>

<p><span style="">That’s all folks, be on the look-out for the
next continous series!</span></p>

<p><span style="">Happy birding always, </span></p>
