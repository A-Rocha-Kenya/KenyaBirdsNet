Leaving quite early we had a<BR>rendezvous with Willie at Kararacha for the remainder of the morning.<BR>The forest was dry, and very quiet. Most birds had evidently had a<BR>brood on the wing and were no longer territorial and so there was
 no<BR>response to any electronic intrusion. Birding had to be mainly on<BR>sight, but we were able to track down a few calling species.<BR>Butterflies were extremely poor, but have apparently been good until<BR>recently. With only two nights in Watamu time was extremely limited,<BR>whilst a good collection of birds from the forest, there was nothing<BR>out of the ordinary. We saw several Zanzibar Boubous, which are now<BR>worth giving an extra glance to following the recent dna findings. For<BR>me the prize was a female Caracal on the track with three active<BR>well-grown kittens, the first Crested Porcupine I have ever seen<BR>abroad in daylight, and really extravert Golden-rumped<BR>Elephant-shrews. We had no time to go down to the Sabaki estuary, but<BR>stopped at a seasonal swamp on the landward side shortly before the<BR>Sabaki Bridge. There was a reasonable collection of species, by far<BR>the most interesting being the presence of a summering
 Madagascar Pond<BR>Heron, in non-breeding dress but the first I have ever seen in Kenya<BR>in February. We had several Malindi Pipits on the new Gongoni Saltwork<BR>extension. On the 12th we took the Sala Gate road via Jilore to Tsavo<BR>East, in preference to driving all the way round. The road really was<BR>not that bad, and before arriving at the gate we had a walk in the<BR>scrub. It was very lively and full of Golden Pipits in full breeding<BR>dress. There were migrants including several each Eurasian Rock-Thrush<BR>and Rufous Bush-Chats and a few Barred Warbler still showing in<BR>numbers. My best observation here was tracking down a pair of singing<BR>Yellow-vented Eremomelas. This is my personal first record for Tsavo<BR>East and the farthest south I have ever seen the species. There was a<BR>nice pair of Somali Bee-eaters also, but they do get further south in<BR>Tsavo West, likewise Pale Prinias. On entering the gate, the Eurasian<BR>Rollers
 were nothing short of astounding with over five hundred lining<BR>the bushes all the way to Aruba Dam. At one pond there were numerous<BR>Chestnut-headed and Chestnut-backed Sparrowlarks coming in to drink.<BR>Odd groups of Madagascar Bee-eaters were present in breeding plumage.<BR>Nearer to the dam there were over 1000 Open-bills on a small area of<BR>water that were so densely packed that we could not actually testify<BR>that there was water present! We spent the night at Ndololo where<BR>there were only two other visitors. That evening a very large movement<BR>of nominate Common Swift passed over low. On the 13th we were due to<BR>go up to Ngangao in the Taita’s, but the weather was dull and showery<BR>and inclement weather at the top of the mountain was suspected. There<BR>were birds enjoying the damp conditions. Many Nightingales were<BR>present, and amazingly one was sitting en metres up on a dead tree<BR>singing it’s heart out. It would
 appear that Nightingales were<BR>wintering well east this year, and we did not encounter any signs of<BR>Sprosser the entire trip. Other migrants included a very early (late!)<BR>Olive-Tree Warbler, and amongst the fairly numerous Olivaceous was an<BR>Upcher’s all of which were probably wintering as were a number of<BR>Spotted Flycatchers. One bird that should not have been wintering in<BR>the area was an Eleonora’s Falcon, which made a very low pass over the<BR>camp. I have never seen a local bird in February before, nor<BR>Olive-Tree Warbler for that matter. Driving out slowly we could see<BR>(or in fact could not see) that the Taitas were under a clothing of<BR>mist and it was decided to have a slow retreat to Nairobi instead of a<BR>mad dash following a morning in the hills. There was an off-plumage<BR>Black Coucal in the rank grassland just west of the dam. This is a<BR>huge and very lush area, and quite waterlogged. Two Red-backed
 Shrikes<BR>also seemed a bit on the early side, but some certainly do winter in<BR>eastern Kenya albeit in miniscule numbers.<BR>After Voi we randomly selected a piece of roadside bush and worked the<BR>area. It was quite a good choice. There were many Barred Warblers<BR>(more than Whitethroat) and some very noisy Irania spread all through<BR>the bush. A pair of Red-naped Bush-Shrikes led a young and sang from<BR>the tops of the most exposed branches. Pringle’s Puffbacks, Bare-eyed<BR>Thrush etc were of course present in the Commiphora as well as a<BR>female Magpie Starling. Eurasian Rollers must have exceeded 1000 birds<BR>all through the Tsavos up to Mtito Andei. The following morning (14th)<BR>we flew to the Mara. Birds were very quiet, again with young and not<BR>at all territorial apart from the occasional obliging bird. We found<BR>many of the western specialities, but nothing of any particular note.<BR>We drove across the entire Mara to
 Sekenani via Musiara and again<BR>whilst pleasant nothing springs to mind. It was amazing to go through<BR>such nice looking rank grass and not a Harlequin Quail to be seen, in<BR>fact none in the whole month of touring East Africa. There was a<BR>single adult Rufous-bellied Heron on the oxbow near Musiara, where the<BR>others were is a mystery. Siana/Sekenani also failed to impress (not<BR>that the clients weren’t seeing the three big cats in twenty<BR>minutes!). On the 15th we drove to Thika. The basin at Naregi Ngare is<BR>flooded and extensive open water, but it is sterile at present with<BR>hardly a duck. Manguo Ponds is starting to fill up, but there is<BR>little open water and hardly much to race the heart. Calling in at the<BR>Kinangop flyover, the paddock had half-a-dozen Sharpe’s Longclaws<BR>including a flying dependent young bird. It also had two African<BR>Snipe, and they might breed here, and the Wing-snapping Cisticolas<BR>were making
 a lot of noise and impressive displays.<BR>On the morning of the 16th, after a night at Thika and paying for the<BR>pleasure of going into the ghastly zoo to get down to the river, it<BR>turned out to be worthwhile. Sitting on a log was a Long-tailed<BR>Cormorant, and either side of it was a Finfoot! There wee also two<BR>Black Ducks, and a few Grey-olive Greenbuls. Like everything else<BR>these too were immune to any temptation to come and see us. Thika<BR>Settling Ponds had no dead or dying birds. There were about three<BR>hundred Garganey, but that was the only palearctic duck, waders were<BR>in small numbers but just the bread-and-butter species and about 150<BR>White-winged Black Terns. The best bird was a Great Reed Warbler, a<BR>strange place for a wintering bird. On the way to Castle Forest we had<BR>seven Hinde’s Babblers, and good numbers of Nightingales and Garden<BR>Warblers. Mwea had many Yellow-crowned Bishops but waders
 and<BR>waterbirds in low numbers although some good looking open paddies. It<BR>was a quiet afternoon at Castle Forest there having been recent rain,<BR>and there was more that evening. The morning of the 17th had three<BR>interesting birds calling, an Olive Ibis flew over calling pre-dawn, a<BR>Buff-spotted Flufftail was calling from some dank forest patch, and a<BR>Barred Long-tailed Cuckoo was welcoming a beautiful dawn. A<BR>Rufous-chested Sparrowhawk was also up early. We had great birding<BR>picking up a whole swathe of upland forest species including a few<BR>Abbott’s Starlings. From here we drove to Samburu with nothing other<BR>than flocks of White Storks on the Timau wheatlands, but more of a<BR>surprise were fifteen Eurasian Rollers on the roadside wires. Flocks<BR>of House Martins clustered on the same lines. Samburu was drying, but<BR>had still a little bit of annual vegetation. It was for Samburu very<BR>quiet, no swarms of weavers, I
 would have said that numbers were way<BR>down on what was expected. We still had an interesting drive in to<BR>Samburu Lodge. The river was low with extensive sandbanks.<BR>The 18th saw us on the Shaba Hill, there were some nice birds of<BR>course and a pair of cavorting and noisy Somali Crombecs was the best<BR>find. Following the riverbank we fund a nice party of four<BR>spring-plumaged Little Ringed Plovers and a Eurasian Hoopoe of the<BR>nominate race. In the afternoon we left for Shaba, finding a Marsh<BR>Warbler (our only individual) in an isolated acacia at Buffalo<BR>Springs. Morning of 19th and we had a pre-breakfast walk on the lava<BR>fields of Shaba. There was a complete dry grass cover, and the<BR>William’s Larks were up and singing. Leaving here we called in for<BR>Boran Cisticola at the Timau Junction, it seems that every visit one<BR>has to climb higher away from the road to find them. Naro Moru had a<BR>fairly busy river, but the
 birding was quite the norm as are the<BR>vepres Black-lored Babblers that always seem to be there these days.<BR>We crossed the Solio Plain on the 20th. So green and grassy, and the<BR>area that looked devastated by the IDP’s, is now looking so much<BR>better, and organised. It’s so good that they have had the good rains<BR>as they are certainly growing some good crops, and the birds are back<BR>in. Along the fence were resting Lesser Kestrels with one Common<BR>Kestrel that was seen to chase a Pipit, one Greater Kestrel, but the<BR>female Amur Falcon should not have been there at this time of year<BR>(like so many other species seen on this tour). Other species included<BR>Whinchats and Red-throated Pipits, which were probably wintering.<BR>Murithi showed us the Mackinder’s Owl and Nyanza Swifts were nesting<BR>in the quarry. There was a darkening of the sky, and the rain started,<BR>but we were due to go across the moorlands to Mutubio Gate. It
 poured,<BR>but as we arrived at the Ark Gate, stopped and the sun came out. The<BR>birds at the gate were quite insane, and with a rise in insects the<BR>trees were alive with flycatching species including such unlikely<BR>species as Cardinal Woodpecker and Emerald Cuckoo. The road was in<BR>excellent condition and we had no problems driving over the top<BR>finding plenty of Jackson’s Francolins with a few chicks, Aberdare<BR>Cisticolas also with young as had the Hill Chats. We twice had nice<BR>views of Harvey’s Red Duikers. As we had our picnic, there was a<BR>Chiffchaff flitting about in the giant heather. The superb Sharpe’s<BR>Longclaw site that was devastated during the recent drought and<BR>planted with potatoes might be coming back, and in fact there looks<BR>like a lot of good Longclaw habitat around North Kinangop. We spent<BR>the night in Nakuru. Next morning (21st) we spent in Nakuru NP. Pretty<BR>depressing with the good places still
 being barricaded. Water level<BR>low, the only White Pelican was one on the sewage ponds, which also<BR>provided the only Black-tailed Godwit and Cape Teal. There were<BR>substantial Ruff and Little Stints on the lake margins. At the Fox<BR>Kestrel cliffs there was only one to be seen, but we were grateful it<BR>was there, and the same Long-legged Buzzard seen in January was also<BR>here as was an adult Lesser Spotted Eagle. Off to Baringo with Francis<BR>leading us around. Lake level up again. Prosopis forest in front of<BR>lodge all decayed giving open shore again, though no muddy edges and<BR>no reeds of course. Both the African Scops and the Lead-coloured<BR>Flycatcher were still garden residents. Morning of 22nd, revealed<BR>frantic activity amongst the weavers, and an impressive variety on the<BR>bird-table which now includes a Grey Hornbill. After a little local<BR>birding we left for the Kerio. The first bird we found on the upper<BR>slopes was
 a Gambaga Flycatcher, the other specialities Green-backed<BR>Eremomela, Western Black-headed Batis and Chestnut-crowned<BR>Sparrow-Weaver were soon located. The surprise in the valley bottom<BR>was a pair of Black-billed Wood-Doves that were photographed. Not now<BR>on the Kenya list (I have made a separate posting for this). We were<BR>surprised at the mating stamina shown by aroused Double-toothed<BR>Barbets, then started our climb out of the Rift.<BR>The swamps at Iten were our next stop but time was pushing on and it<BR>was dusk on our arrival at Kakamega. Rondo Retreat is still one of the<BR>highlights, but I really don’t think that the standards of cuisine<BR>shine a candle on the delicious food that used to come out of their<BR>kitchen. The staff were still falling over themselves to make our stay<BR>as memorable as possible. It rained heavily that night, but was a<BR>brighter morning on the 23rd, as we headed off to the Ikuywa River.<BR>The
 pipe-laying devastation is most unpleasant and much of the<BR>roadside scrub along the forest edge has been removed, and it looks<BR>horrible. As we arrived at the river, the first bird I could hear was<BR>Chapin’s Flycatcher and so on locating it that became our first bird.<BR>Overall I was very disappointed with the birds, most were quiet,<BR>virtually anything that was calling was unresponsive and some common<BR>species were never seen. We spent the morning along the road, then had<BR>a leisurely lunch before trying again for the afternoon. All in all we<BR>did well enough, that it would be more advantageous to leave the next<BR>morning for the Busia grasslands without an early lingering in<BR>Kakamega. First stop on the morning of 24th was Mumias Bridge, with a<BR>pair of Rock Pratincoles in residence. The grasslands were quiet,<BR>little calling and required a lot of effort for little return. A large<BR>male de Brazza’s Monkey snacked on
 Phoenix Palm fruit. We found a few<BR>of the local western species, and had a nice time with a pair of<BR>Locustfinch. At Nambale a White-crested Turaco still holds on probably<BR>thanks to the protection of the monkeys now. The Sio Weir back down<BR>the Kisumu Road had a very showy palearctic Little Bittern, and two<BR>Allen’s Gallinules that were attaining blue plumage. From here it was<BR>across the border at Busia into Uganda……<BR></DIV></DIV></DIV></div></body></html>
