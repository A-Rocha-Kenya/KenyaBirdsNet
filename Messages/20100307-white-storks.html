  <pre>We saw a few White Storks on the way past Soy Sambu this weekend.....not 40,000. However, in Nakuru Park when we arrived at Naishi on Friday evening there were a few thousand festooning the trees by the Guest House, airstrip and campsite. They were impossible to count as they were so dispersed.
