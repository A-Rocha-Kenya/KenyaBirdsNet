  <pre>Don, thanks for this. I had always assumed the Mau was the source of our 
Serengeti birds, but for sure they can move further than this.

Grateful for any update on this Maralal population.

Neil

&gt; Neil;  The place to check are the grasslands north of Maralal - the sole 
&gt; lekking area of this species. Not sure when anyone last went there. 
&gt; Probably out of the question at the moment due to floods.
&gt; Numbers on the southern Mau slopes were always small, and probably still 
&gt; so.
