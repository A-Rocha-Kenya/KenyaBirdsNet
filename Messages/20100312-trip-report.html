<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Johan and I went on a trip discovering Western Kenya with a Belgian birdwatcher for 11 days. We spent 1 day in Nakuru, 2 days in Kisumu, 3 days in Kakamega, 2 days in Mt Elgon, 1 day in Kerio and 2 days in Baringo. The weather was rainy with showers in the morning and the afternoon and every day... It made us difficult to go birding like we wanted to but we managed...</DIV>
<DIV>Please find hereunder the list for each localities (appart of Kerio because of the heavy rain all the day).</DIV>
