<b><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subject:</span></b> unidentified phylloscopus nairobi np<br></font><br>Dear Itai,<br>I found this bird in Nairobi Park yesterday. I was wondering if you<br>could give me your ten cents worth as to what you think it could be, I<br>
have my ideas! Can you put it on the net, or send to anyone else who<br>might have experience with northern phylloscs. Looking forward to<br>hearing of your trip, I bet I would have had stacks of liers. I have<br>posted latest observations separately,<br>
Hope you are all well,<br>Brian<br><br>“Can
 anybody shed any light on this observation please. I am somewhat<br>confused as to the identification of a phylloscopus in Nairobi<br>National Park on 20th March 2010. I have an idea of what it might be,<br>but it is rather outrageous though not impossible.<br>
I was with Patrick Lhoir and his father, we were at the Hippo Pools<br>and there were a few migrant warblers in the area. In the canopy of a<br>medium-sized acacia we located a rather chunky Phylloscopus but it was<br>difficult to judge size without any other birds for a direct<br>
comparison, however it looked larger than any Willow Warbler we had<br>been looking at (including one minute prior to the observation and a<br>minute after it). I could see through the vegetation that the bird was<br>pure white underneath and said that it must be a Wood Warbler. As the<br>
bird emerged from cover we could see that the bird lacked any yellow<br>on the throat and breast and this too was snow white. Knowing
 that<br>there have been Wood Warblers that lack the yellow I still thought<br>that this bird could only be a Wood Warbler. We took video and images<br>of the bird, but clearly the tail is too long for a Wood, being more<br>
similarly proportioned to a Willow.<br>Examination of the images shows some other features, not associated<br>with migrant phylloscopus to the region. The most noticeable feature<br>apart from the all white underparts was the striking head pattern. The<br>
upper parts were not seen well as for most of the time the bird was<br>almost directly overhead, but appeared a fairly bright olive-green,<br>brighter than most Willow Warblers that we encounter here and darker<br>than Wood Warbler. The top of the head was also olive-green. Under<br>
this was a very pale yellow sweeping supercilium extending from the<br>base of the bill back to near the start of the nape. An equally long<br>and striking dark line ran from the back of the eye, as far
 as the<br>sides of the nape, whilst in front of the eye this continued to the<br>base of the bill with a more greenish tinge. As a continuous line this<br>ran underneath the white supercilium for its entire length. Underneath<br>
the black supercilium was a shorter whitish line running from just<br>under the leading edge of the eye, back to the side of the nape, and<br>below this a shadowy crescentic line of similar length. The bill was<br>dark on the ridge of the upper mandible, paler brown on the sides and<br>
lower mandible with a yellowish base and dark tip. The underside of<br>the lower mandible was brighter yellow as was the mouth lining,<br>however the bill appeared black against backlight. The bill appeared<br>shorter than Willow Warbler. The eye was brownish, but appeared dark<br>
in the field. There was a narrow pale crescent below the lower eyelid.<br>The underparts from chin to extremity of undertail coverts were pure<br>white, but although not
 noted in the field, the image close-ups show<br>faint and diffuse longitudinal darker streaking. The undertail coverts<br>were long, but there was still substantial amount of tail protruding<br>unlike a Wood Warbler. The legs were pale pinkish-flesh, possibly<br>
slightly paler than a Willow Warbler. The images show a whitish<br>translucency all around the extremities of the tail which was quite<br>deeply notched.. The bend of the wing looks yellow and in one image a<br>slightly raised wing shows the underwing as appearing lemon-yellow.<br>
The movements through the vegetation were quite sluggish, there was no<br>noticeable tail or wing flicking, and the bird gleaned from the acacia<br>twigs. After we had studied this bird for several minutes it flew off<br>
but did not seem to go any great distance.<br>The upper images are grabs from the video to show different features,<br>the remainder a selection of images.”<br></div></div></div></div>
