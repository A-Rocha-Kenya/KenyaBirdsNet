  <pre>Dear All,
As a break from the all too frustratingly powerless Nairobi (as it is
now as I write this), Nigel Hunter, Fleur Ng&#39;Weno Catherine Ngarachu
and myself went down to Olorgesailie for one nights pleasant stay in
their Bandas.
The amount and location of rainfall was extraordinary. The first
indication of the cyclonic weather was on the steep descent after
Kisamese, where the water pouring down there has been sufficient to
wash large rocks all over the road, forcing the traffic into a single
lane in the centre. The Ol Kejo bridge looks like a nuclear disaster,
the shameless illegal charcoal harvesting has allowed the water to
pour down the valley and has washed away the safety railings on both
sides to the bridge. All the way to Olorgesailie now are open plains
with scattered small trees, but nothing like the wooded wilderness it
used to be. The grass cover is still scant and it looks as if there
has been very little rain in many areas. There are patches of denser
scrub on the hills but their days too are probably numbered. After
such a bad drought and lack of habitat it is not surprising that birds
seem to be disappearing drastically, although Fawn-coloured Larks are
all over the place, taking advantage of the open areas. The variety of
birds was there, but the numbers were very low. Olorgesaillie area
however is still well wooded along the banks of the river, and the Ol
Tepesi-Emerit road still has plenty of habitat. Although brief we had
some nice birding in the area.
We started birding from the Ol Kejo bridge and the species recorded
are all from the Olorgesaillie side of the river. There were three
Black-and-White Cuckoos at the bridge, and a Black Cuckoo calling on
the slopes. A party of six Eurasian Bee-eaters were flying over but
migrants were in very short supply. Two Olivaceous and Willow, single
Whitethroat and Garden Warbler and a couple of Spotted Flycatchers. A
Pringle&#39;s Puffback called but we did not locate it, and there was a
smart male Eurasian Rock-Thrush.  The best find was the first
Fischer&#39;s Starling for the area, I wonder if it has been recorded in
the Rift before. It was in the swampy area just past the place where
the road runs alongside the river gorge some ten kilometres beyond
Olorgesaillie.
The gorge itself had about eight Horus Swifts showing interest in the
steep sandy banks.
Other interesting observations were over 200 Abdim&#39;s Storks and a
solitary White Stork in the low depression on the other side of the
road from Ol Tepesi village. Also in this flooded basin we found two
Temminck&#39;s Coursers, a Green Sandpiper, single Red-throated Pipit and
four flava and a very attractive thunbergi Yellow Wagtail. In spite of
the wet conditions no other water-associated species had been
attracted.
At night at the bandas there were plenty of Slender-tailed Nightjar,
but no Donaldson-Smith&#39;s Nightjars calling. The entry road had the
only migrant shrike, a Lesser Grey, but there were many Capped
Wheatears from unknown provenance, and a male Pied Wheatear that had
the black areas replaced by chocolate brown. A few Heuglin&#39;s Coursers
were calling, and we found one on the Emerit Road the next morning. At
the swampy area six kilometres along the road from Ol Tepesi we heard
and managed to locate a Buttonquail, there were several Harlequin
Quails calling, a migrant Common Kestrel, two Kori Bustards, both
Chestnut-bellied and Black-faced Sandgrouse, a Eurasian Cuckoo, two
each of Great Reed and Barred Warblers, Eurasian Reed Warblers
chattering from the swamp grass, a scattering of Olivaceous Warblers,
Spotted Flycatchers and a Whitethroat. Two Northern Wheatears and a
Eurasian Rock-Thrush completed the migrants here.  There were a number
of Singing Bushlarks in the grassy plains, but there were only two on
the plains at Ol Tepesi and none at all at Olorgesaillie. The entire
region seemed to be dripping in White-throated Bee-eaters, many
displaying pairs. The open grasslands were attracting many Cardinal
Queleas.
A list of all of the species recorded follows,
Best to All
