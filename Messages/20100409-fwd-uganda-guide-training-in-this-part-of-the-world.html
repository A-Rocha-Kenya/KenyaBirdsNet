<br><br>Dear Herbert,<br><br>We haven&#39;t met since the PAOC a year or so ago...I&#39;ve been following your posts here and elsewhere.<br><br>This call is great timing - early next month I&#39;m presenting a paper at the upcoming Society of Ethnobiology conference as part of session titled: <font size="2">Ethnoornithology in review, prospect and perspective</font><br>

<p>In this paper I will examine the potential for culturally-based bird 
tourism to provide opportunities for employment and economic development
 for local groups and people.</p>
<p>Birding tourism is widely regarded as a lucrative sub-set of the 
broader tourism market, with a variety of services provided by a wide 
range of local and international suppliers. Those services range from 
tours where birds are included in a broader, general product to 
dedicated birding-only tours.</p>
<p>I will examine and compare recent proposals in Australia and several 
countries in eastern Africa that have sought to develop economic and 
employment opportunities for local people to enter the birding tourism 
market by developing and offering birding tourism products that are 
distinguished by the inclusion of local cultural knowledge of birds into
 products offered to potential clients.</p>
<p>Issues that will be considered include local training requirements, 
marketing, issues related to access to land and the involvement of 
national peak bodies and organizations, government assistance and the 
potential benefits and risks involved in culturally-based birding 
tourism.</p>  </div>END abstract<br><br>I don&#39;t have any local Field Guides or spare bins that I can send - I&#39;m off to do two weeks with local Rangers on Aboriginal land from Monday next and will take all the bins I have out there.<br>



<br>I&#39;ll re-post your call onto the Birding-Aus webgroup and see if that gets any response.<br><br>I&#39;d love to hear more from you about the training you are about to do and of course of your thoughts on this matter generally and any information you might have about this important issue.<br>



<br>If you (or anyone on Birdchat) have any resources that might be relevant to my talk please feel free to forward them to me.<br><br>Cheers, thanks and I look forward to speaking to you again soon,<br><br>Bob Gosford<br>

<br>
The only way for the communities to understand the values of<br>
ecotourism is to directly benefit from the revenue collected from<br>
tourists. This month Iam off again to train the communities around<br>
Bwindi National Park in Birding and Biodiversity conservation. As a<br>
second alternative from the Mountain Gorillas, this region tops other<br>
birding sites in Africa but with less bird guides.<br>
The communities around this area have been looking for funds to use in<br>
organising the training, but in vain. Â I have decided to go down there<br>
and give them an introduction course to bird watching. We begin on<br>
23rd April to 31, 2010.<br>
<br>
Any one willing to send in a field guide book, or a pair of binoculars<br>
you are welcome. I gues you know how challenging in can be to train<br>
some to be a bird guide, without binoculars or field guide books.<br>
<br>
Thank you all for your support. .<br>
