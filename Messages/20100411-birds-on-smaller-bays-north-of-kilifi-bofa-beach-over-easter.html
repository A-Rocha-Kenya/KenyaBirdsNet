<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>On the&nbsp;first evening walking on&nbsp;&nbsp;the 
beach there were a good number of lesser crested terns together with some 
smaller terns.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also with the groups</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>were sooty gulls, a few crab plovers, and many 
ringed plovers.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The second day on the same beach, the majority of 
the </FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>lesser crested had gone, leaving only one or 
two but there was a large number of small grey</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>terns, a few of&nbsp;which appeared to have red 
bills and legs, but it was difficult to be sure.&nbsp;&nbsp; Would Common Terns 
be expected?</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>There were many curlew sandpipers, ring necked 
plovers, a good scattering of sanderlings, a few ruddy turnstone, crab plovers, 
grey plovers and the usual sooty gulls.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>In comparison Bofa beach had very few birds, mainly 
ring necked plovers, grey plovers and a few gulls.&nbsp;&nbsp; This isnow a much 
more frequented beach with a marked reduction in the little ghost crabs etc.
