  <pre>On April 10, I visited the Savage wilderness safaris at Tana, to raft the river. Note this was not a birding trip, I just noted the birds as we tasted on the river.  There were many grey-headed kingfishers and one giant kingfisher as far as kingfishers were concerned, but no pied as I have before seen them in large numbers. There were good numbers of black-headed and golden palm weavers and a couple of spectacled weavers were seen just after passing the bridge. A Great sparrowhawk flew over yhe river amongst many black kites and a couple African Harrier-Hawks.  Wire-tailed and lesser-striped swallows were present along with both plain and rock martins.  For the first time I or the Savage Wilderness guides had seen here,  was a large Verreaux&#39;s Eagle-Owl perched In a very open spot right next to the river as we passed by. There were African Black-headed orioles in good numbers at the campsite as well as a group of over 15 violet-backed starlings.  A
 couple of hornbills flew over which were either tumpeter or silvery-cheeked, but I didn&#39;t get the exact species.  A single African Black Duck was the only duck of the rafting trip.   
Overall, it was a good list of birds for not actually spending time to find birds in the area.
Happy birding to all, 
Jesse
