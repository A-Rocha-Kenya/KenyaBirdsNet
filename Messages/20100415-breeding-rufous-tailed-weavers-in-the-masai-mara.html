<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Yesterday morning (14<sup>th</sup> April) I stumbled upon a small breeding colony of Rufous-tailed Weavers in the Masai Mara. There were 7 nests in an acacia although two were unsubstantial and probably just early efforts. At least 6 adults were present around the tree, which looked like 3 pairs, and a single fledgling, showing a yellowish-horn coloured bill, was accompanied by one of the adults. Within at least one of the nests, young birds were calling and one of the adults busily attended this nest. I have a selection of images available if anyone is interested.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The location was along the Mara river south of the confluence of the Talek river. Although the species is endemic to northern Tanzania, I understand from Itai that it has indeed been recorded in the Mara on several occasions but wondered if the species has been recorded as breeding here? </font></span></p>
