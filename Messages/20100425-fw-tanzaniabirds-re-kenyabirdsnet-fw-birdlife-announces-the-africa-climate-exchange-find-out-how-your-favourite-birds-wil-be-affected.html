<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Colin is not a member of these groups so this msg 
will not have reached you.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>I've asked him for a pdf of his paper mentioned 
below and will circulate it.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>While Climate Change is "real" it's effect on 
Africa's birdlife is currently insignificant compared to the effect of 
this&nbsp;rapid human population growth. Many of the range shifts and 
local&nbsp;extirpations we are witnessing can be laid at the door of habitat 
degradation.&nbsp;A warmer climate will exaggerate&nbsp;the desiccation of 
marginal habitats but habitat change due to over exploitation&nbsp;should 
be&nbsp;far more of a concern to all of us living today. There really are people 
in Europe who are looking at suggesting changing the borders of our protected 
areas to accommodate range shifts "in the future"...if only wild Africa had a 
future.............</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Using a flawed data set (esp when more accurate 
data exists) and applying questionable models will do nothing to enhance bird 
conservation in Africa.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>We must look to habitat protection&nbsp;and wise 
use&nbsp;with long term improvements in local agriculture (permaculture is the 
key word here) NOT huge mechanised farms growing food and biofuel for Middle 
Eastern and Far Eastern countries or bottom line accounting for Western European 
timber companies. The long term, indeed the only, solution to Africa's problems 
lies with an EDUCATED population who will control it's own 
growth,&nbsp;prosperity and eventually it's own destiny.</FONT></DIV>

<P>Hi all,<BR><BR>I'd just like to add to Neil's 'health warning' to these 
projections. <BR>Neil's warnings come from his massive experience in the field 
and data <BR>use side, my own perspective is from the statistical end, where 
I've a <BR>bit of experience.<BR><BR>You may be aware that the largely the same 
team produced a book of <BR>similar projections for European bird distributions: 
<BR><A 
href="http://www.lynxeds.com/product/climatic-atlas-european-breeding-birds.">http://www.lynxeds.<WBR>com/product/<WBR>climatic-<WBR>atlas-european-<WBR>breeding-<WBR>birds.</A> 
<BR>The first chapter of this is essentially a health warning on the rest of 
<BR>the book - but obviously no-one reads that. And I can't find a similar 
<BR>warning on the African website. To cut a long story short, I research 
<BR>the processes that shape species distribution limits and like to play 
<BR>with statistical methods. I had access to the same European datasets the 
<BR>Durham/RSPB team had, so I thought I'd check out their methods and see 
<BR>if they really are finding anything other than chance associations 
<BR>between climate and birds. The result of my efforts was published a 
<BR>couple of years ago - it's at <BR><A 
href="http://www.pnas.org/content/105/39/14908.short?cited-by=yes&amp;legid=pnas;105/39/14908">http://www.pnas.<WBR>org/content/<WBR>105/39/14908.<WBR>short?cited-<WBR>by=yes&amp;legid=<WBR>pnas;105/<WBR>39/14908</A> 
<BR>and I can send anyone interested the pdf if they want. In essence, we 
<BR>find that the distributions of most European species are not 
<BR>statistically significantly associated with climate and other things are 
<BR>the main factor determining distribution - other species, human 
<BR>activity, mountain barriers, coastlines, etc. And consequently, most of 
<BR>the projections made in the atlas are completely unfounded. I know our 
<BR>findings rather upset the team in Durham (and various others globally - 
<BR>criticising an immensley popular method is a good way to make yourself 
<BR>unpopular...<WBR>), but no-one's come up with a solution to the problem we 
<BR>identified in the last two years and this African project has exactly 
<BR>the same statistical flaw as the European one. So, to add to Neil's call 
<BR>- please do be very, very careful in interpreting these maps.<BR><BR>Best 
wishes,<BR><BR>Colin<BR><BR>(NB - the better the data available through atlas 
projects and the like, <BR>the better we will be able to do this sort of thing 
properly, so please <BR>make your birding count and send your records to the 
appropriate atlas!)<BR><BR>Neil and Liz Baker wrote:<BR>&gt; Paul and 
all<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; I've just had a quick look at this, clicked on Cape Teal, a

2003. A reassessment of the northern population of the Cape <BR>&gt; Teal /Anas 
capensis/. /Scopu/s 23: 29-43.<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; This Worldmap data set is 
seriously flawed, as far as Cape Teal is <BR>&gt; concerned it's a work of pure 
fiction.<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; Is this Worldmap data published in a peer reviewed 
paper ? reference please.<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; Where did they get their original 
data from ? curious that Durham / <BR>&gt; BirdLife did not ask us for any 
data.<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; Have they used recent data (unpublished) from the new 
Kenya Atlas or <BR>&gt; only the maps in Lewis &amp; Pomeroy 1989 ?<BR>&gt; 
<BR>&gt; Did they have access to the raw data for the Uganda, Zambia, Malawi, 
<BR>&gt; Southern Africa, Liberia, Ghana, Ethiopia, Somalia (any others out 
<BR>&gt; there?) atlases<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; How did they differentiate between 
known "range" and extralimital <BR>&gt; records ? The std atlases do not unless 
it's in the text. It's the same <BR>&gt; black blob for a single record as it is 
for a thousand.<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; How did they differentiate between "old" 
literature records, many of <BR>&gt; which are specimens and are often 
incorrectly labeled with poor locality <BR>&gt; data and rather many 
identification errors.<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; and...where did they get their "current" 
climate data from ? the Uganda <BR>&gt; Atlas habitat predictions uses data from 
only 16 rainfall stations and <BR>&gt; all of us working in Africa understand 
how inaccurate "government data" <BR>&gt; can be.<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; Ken, I would 
strongly recommend you check carefully those species you <BR>&gt; are familiar 
with before you get too excited and most certainly before u <BR>&gt; even think 
about making recommendations to African governments regarding <BR>&gt; 
conservation issues based on these highly theoretical range changes.<BR>&gt;

Colleagues<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; BirdLife International is pleased 
to announce the launch of the website <BR>&gt; on climate change issues for 
Africa www.africa-climate- exchange. org/ <BR>&gt; &lt;<A

<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; The Africa Climate Exchange (ACE) is relevant for 
African policy makers, <BR>&gt; local communities, scientists and resource 
managers.<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; ACE includes a rapidly growing 
library, currently containing over 400 <BR>&gt; downloadable documents on a wide 
range of climate change topics. <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; Up to date 
news on climate change from across Africa are available.<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; 
<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; For Birders!!<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; The ACE 
contains over 1600 species maps showing how individual species <BR>&gt; they 
will be affected by climate change starting from Present, 2025, <BR>&gt; 2055 up 
to 2085. <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; Just type the common, scientific or 
family name and there you have the <BR>&gt; maps! How exciting? <BR>&gt;
