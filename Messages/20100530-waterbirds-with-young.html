Nature Kenya's Wednesday morning birdwalk had another fabulous morning at Paradise Lost near Kiambu on September 29, despite the large size of the group and the dark and drizzly weather. A considerable time was spent at the seasonal wetland in the coffee estate. Highlights include:<BR>
<BR>
Cattle Egrets picking off tree frogs from the coffee bushes next to us<BR>
White-backed Ducks with seven small ducklings<BR>
About 100 Yellow-billed Ducks<BR>
Little Grebes feeding large young<BR>
Red-knobbed Coots with a half-grown, silvery, begging young one and another pair with two tiny chicks like balls of black fluff with fiery heads<BR>
African Jacana with large young<BR>
Giant, Pied, Malachite and Pygmy Kingfishers<BR>
<BR>
Wishing you a good World Bird Festival this weekend, Fleur<BR>
