  <div>Hi All,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The other day while trying to photograph Quailfinch, I noticed this family of young birds acting rather bizarrely. First they were huddled down but as I began to photograph them they suddenly shot their posteriors in the air simultaneously. This happened a couple of times.<br>
</div>

<div> </div>
<div>Can anyone suggest a reason for this behaviour?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Adam</div>
