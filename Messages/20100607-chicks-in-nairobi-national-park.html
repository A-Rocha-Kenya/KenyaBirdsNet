Nairobi National Park was all green this Sunday morning, 7 March &#8211; bronzed green with flowering grasses in the northwest, and vivid green with new grass in the southeast, against a magnificent backdrop of white and grey clouds.<BR>
<BR>
Highlights were a pair of Grey Crowned Cranes shepherding three small chicks, and a miniscule Three-banded Plover chick running ahead of its mother. Also Lesser Kestrels hovering, Kori Bustards displaying, lots of African Quailfinch and nine rhinos.<BR>
<BR>
Wishing you good birding, Fleur</SPAN></FONT>
