  <pre>Dear All,
I have just defied some of the laws of the universe, who says sitting and waiting doesnt pay up?
*please dont try this at home*
I had a rather eventful day, just sitting in my home office today, let me tell you all the story:
It began at 5:45am, when i decided to take a walk on the beach, here, in Mombasa, along the Jomo Kenyatta Beach.
Started off from near whitesands, heading towards Serena, Along the way, i see my usual morning treat: long tailed cormorants, and grey herons and little egrets.
On reaching the end, i turned back, headed back towards whitesands, and saluted the herons and egrets again not remembering if i had already..
There i came across a rather tough looking Osprey, it was now 6:45am-ish. Soaring majestically, and finally seeing something he liked in the water, far far off he went close to the reef somewhere, too proud to be seen catching fish that wasnt his size, or maybe because it was off-tide and he needed to fish in deeper water.
Almost home now, and i went deaf with the noises: sqwak sqwak sqwak, and mini-clouds of &#34;something&#34; kept coming between me and my morning sun.. i looked up to find the many many crows apparently not happy that the Osprey is way better than them, and they darted at it, over and over again, till one Nasty Crow (ow how those make me mad), pirated the Tough - Body Builder - like - Ospreys meal..
And off into the distance, in disappointment it fled, across the road, seemingly towards the Bamburi Cement Side. In my mind, i was hoping and wishing and praying he&#39;d come back with a battalion of Bigger; Mama &amp; Papa Ospreys and Other Tough and Fierce gang members to bash the crows&#39; heads in.. But i wouldnt ever know, although, that is what i told myself that happened.

The Rest of the day was about getting into work, but, saw EGO&#39;s (eurasian golden orioles) just breeze through the backyard, stopping briefly in the neem trees.. Odd??
and soon after, i heard my dear friend calling, Lizard Buzzard. Hadnt heard him in a while, and as i went out to greet the fellow, i saw him being bullied by Drongo&#39;s.. soon after, it took off and hid in the thick mango tree.. and not minutes later, it took off completely..
Half an hour later, he whistles to me again, telling me to come out and play, and i did, carrying our favourite pass time toys, which consists of various cameras and lenses, but, sad to see, this time, his was exposed by those Nuisance crows and fled again!

At about 5pm there was explosions of quacking outside, i knew who they were immediately, SICHEHO&#39;s (Silvery Cheeked Hornbills) a WHOLE FLOCK of SEVEN hornbills!! Thats FOUR MORE than i have ever seen in a flock together, hoping from one MANGO TREE to another.. Then Pose, Exposed at the top of a tall Casuarina, and fall back onto a Mango tree, and in no Time.. Woosh! Gone Again, with their squawking echoing into nothingness.

While i was out, caught a glimpse of those Elusive neighbors of mine all perched on a fig tree.. Those AFGREPIGS (african green pigeons), which was and always is a delight..
As i write this it is now 5:45pm, grey capped kingfishers are packing it in for the day, and drongos, and bulbuls, and Olive sunbirds with their lullaby that should persist on for at least another 30 minutes or so.. AND 1 Black Backed Puffback..

It my opinion, the last year or so has seen a Drop in Lizard Buzzard, Black Backed Puffback, and Lilac Breasted Rollers.

I know the crow population has had its part to play because the crows are EVERYWHERE. On the beach, every morning, feeding on what i assume to be tiny crabs?

Hope they find their way back whence they came from, i miss the Mr &amp; Mrs Lilac Breasted rollers that used to come and squabble and mate on the dead stump of the palm tree outside the house! :(

All the best.

PS: NEIL AND LIZ, ANY NEWS ON THIS HORRID SERENGETI - HIGHWAY? Any feed back would be great. Sponsors? Or any Environmental Impact Reports? or HOW DID TANAPA ISSUE PERMITS FOR THIS ANIMAL SUICIDE HIGHWAY?
