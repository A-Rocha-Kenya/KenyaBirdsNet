  <div>Hi all,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Just a quick line to report 8 (possibly 9) White-throated Bee-eaters roosted at Naibor Camp, Masai Mara, last night (8th June). All loudly catching insects above the office! Sadly, poor light prevented decent images but they were thoroughly enjoyed by Vicki and I.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>I gather from Zimmerman et al., that this is an odd time of year to see the species in the south of the country as they should by now have returned north to breed?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Regards,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Adam</div>
