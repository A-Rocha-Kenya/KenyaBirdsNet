Thanks Brian
for your ID which i would for sure and better trust than mine. I 
thought i was looking at a much heavier bill

Just came from shaba and can&#39;t figure out if this would be the 
Singing or Friedmann&#39;s Bush Lark. The photographed individual never 
sang though other friedmann&#39;s were singing.

many thanks
  chege

&gt;Hi Chege,
&gt;
&gt;Nice to ear from you. Hope you&#39;re fine.
&gt;
&gt;Brian also replied on my mail :
&gt;
&gt;Hi Patrick,
&gt;It&#39;s a Red-capped Lark bleached by the soda in the soil, many almost
&gt;lose all of their pattern,
&gt;Best for now
&gt;Brian
&gt;Anyway thank you very much. Athi Short-toed Lark was also my though 
&gt;but for sure Brian knows much than me.
&gt;
&gt;Can you tell me were in Crater Lake did you spot the Grey-crested 
&gt;Helmetshrike? Near the lake?
&gt;
&gt;Thank you very much for the place you explained me last year for the 
&gt;William&#39;s Lark. I found it exactly at that place. In fact I was 
&gt;there one week after you.
&gt;
&gt;Hope we can go birding together.
&gt;
&gt;Best regards,
&gt;
&gt;Patrick
