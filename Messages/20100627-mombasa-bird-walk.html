<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dear Birders,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Still a lot of rain in Mombasa which is very good 
for many important reasons but does not enhance our bird walks to areas where 
there are wetlands and ponds as they are filled to the brim with water and there 
is no wading or perching space for the water birds.&nbsp; The trees are lush and 
verdant so difficult to see the arboreal species.&nbsp; Consequently our trip to 
Nguuni Animal park had to rely mostly on birds feeding on the grass, those 
flying by and&nbsp;others that ran along the ground.&nbsp; 26 species was the 
total which is a&nbsp;pretty low number for this area.&nbsp; Bare Eyed Thrushes 
were plentiful, lots of Golden Palm, Black Headed and Grosbeak Weavers building 
nests and a small flock of Greater Blue Earred Starlings.&nbsp; Zanzibar Bishops 
in full and resplendant breeding dress were many.&nbsp; Special and not often 
seen these days was a Nubian Woodpecker, a single Violet Backed Starling 
(female)&nbsp;and about 10 Senegal Plovers.&nbsp; On the drive back to the gate 
Slender Tailed Nightjars were sitting on the road, allowing themselves to be 
watched before flying off as we passed by.&nbsp; Interesting that although it 
was totally dark there were Pale Flycatchers and one Flappet Lark still feeding 
on the road.&nbsp; We really miss the larger water birds due to the fact that 
all the reeds have been eaten by the numerous Water Buck and now that there are 
16 Giraffes there we pray that they will not eat all the Acacia 
trees.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wishing you all great birding.&nbsp; (Marlene Reid -
