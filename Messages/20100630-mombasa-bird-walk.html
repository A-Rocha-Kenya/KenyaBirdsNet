<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Venue Haller Park:&nbsp; Rain stopped for the 
duration of the bird walk but it ws pretty wet under foot.&nbsp; First we had to 
visit the Owl enclosure to see the rescued/caged Spotted&nbsp;and Verreaux Eagle 
Owls.&nbsp; We had a new bird walker who had never seen these owls before so she 
was very excited especially as she later in the week discovered&nbsp;a 
Verreaux&nbsp;nesting on the Forest Trails.&nbsp; When we stopped by they were 
being fed on rats.&nbsp; Interestingly one of the owls just swallowed a whole 
rat, head first.&nbsp; I thought Owls pulled the prey apart and in fact that is 
what the other owls were doing.&nbsp; Any comment?</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The rest of the forest was extremely quiet; 
&nbsp;main sepcies were Mangrove Kingfisher, Black Throated Wattle Eye, Woolly 
Necked Stork, Olive Sunbird, Palmnut Vulture.&nbsp; At the animal enclosure 
(also pretty quiet) African Fish Eagle, Green Backed Heron, Magagascar Squacco 
Heron.&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazing song from the White Browed Robin Chats which always 
sing more when it rains but it was a case of heard and hardly seen. &nbsp;Only 
19 species overall.&nbsp; Birding is always exciting!</FONT></DIV>
