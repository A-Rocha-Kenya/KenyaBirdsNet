 distinct from the nominate, as Estrilda<BR>charmosyna kiwanukae. On trying to learn more of this I came across<BR>the following.<BR><BR>Mackworth-Praed and Grant<BR>Treat erythronotus (race delamerei) and charmosyna as erythronotus,<BR>not being aware of kiwanukae. Charmosyna has an eastern and northern<BR>distribution.<BR><BR>Stevenson and John Fanshawe<BR>Make no mention of the existence of kiwanukae, even though that is<BR>what they have illustrated instead of the widespread nominate. The map<BR>shows no crossing into Tanzania.<BR><BR>Zimmermann and Turner<BR>Give details of the dark second form of Black-cheeked as Estrilda<BR>charmosyna kiwanukae, but the range is endemic to Magadi Road as far<BR>as Olorgesailie and sympatric with Estrilda erythronotus delamerei<BR>over this range. Their map shows its proximity to the Tanzanian<BR>border, but not quite reaching it.<BR><BR>Britton<BR>Is pre erythronotus/charmosyna split and both are treated
 under<BR>Black-cheeked Waxbill, the pre-split name which now is reserved for<BR>charmosyna. However the distribution under the charmosyna umbrella<BR>with no mention or recognition of kiwanukae, is given as also<BR>occurring in Thika, Simba and both East and West Tsavo, as well as<BR>Lake Magadi/Olorgesailie.<BR><BR>Howard and Moore<BR>Recognises&nbsp; charmosyna as distinct from erythronotus, and the<BR>existence of three races of charmosyna.&nbsp; Nominate is in Somalia, S.<BR>Ethiopia, S. Sudan, Uganda and N. Kenya. A race pallidior is given as<BR>C. Kenya, which presumably relates to the Thika record in Britton.<BR>Finally kiwanukae is given as S Kenya and N. Tanzania.<BR><BR>Clements<BR>Compounds the story by calling erythronotus Black-cheeked Waxbill, and<BR>charmosyna as Red-rumped Waxbill! However whilst not recognising<BR>pallidior, he does list nominate as much the same distribution as<BR>Howard and Moore, except in Kenya where he has it only
 in the NE.<BR>Kiwanukae is given S Kenya to extreme N Tanzania.<BR><BR>Clement, Harris and Davis, Finches and Sparrows<BR>This is the monograph of the estrildids. More confusion in common<BR>names as Black-faced Waxbill is used for the DRC endemic Estrilda<BR>nigriloris. They were not recognising charmosyna as a species, and<BR>include it in with erythronotus which they call Black-cheeked Waxbill.<BR>Monograph or not, a look at the plate will show an enormous screw-up.<BR>I started reading the text, and they were stating that delamerei was<BR>very different from the southern nominate, and so I wanted to see just<BR>how different it looked on the plate (45), and lo and behold the bird<BR>labelled as delamerei is in fact kiwanukae race of charmosyna, so then<BR>looking at what they were calling charmosyna, it is in fact delamerei!<BR>Of the five illustrations there is no nominate charmosyna illustrated.<BR>Referring back to the text, it further stated
 that charmosyna might be<BR>a distinct species from erythronotus.&nbsp; For distributions charmosyna is<BR>given as extending south to Tsavo East and West, kiwanukae though is<BR>given southern Kenya from Magadi to Teita (which mean an overlap of<BR>charmosyna and kiwanukae in Tsavos!!!), to Olduvai and Dodoma, N.<BR>Tanzania. They do not mention pallidior.<BR><BR>So the truth of these three forms in East Africa is still wide open<BR>for some proper investigation, as it would seem that in all<BR>publications, only confusion reigns.<BR><BR>Best to all<BR>Brian<BR></DIV></DIV></DIV><!-- cg14.c2.mail.re1.yahoo.com compressed/chunked Fri Jan 15 01:10:55 PST 2010 --></div></body></html>
