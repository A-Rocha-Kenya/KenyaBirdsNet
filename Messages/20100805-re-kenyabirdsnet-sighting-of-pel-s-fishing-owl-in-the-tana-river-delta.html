      <p></p><div style="font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt;"><div>Hello all, </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have recently joined the mail group and have not had time since my travels in April to post a very exciting sighting...</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>On April 6th, my husband and I took a boat 2 hours up the Tana River from the mouth.&nbsp; We veered to the right ( around 830 am) and went around a small island.&nbsp; Immediately on leaving the main river, we saw a huge bird fly across the top of the trees and perch at the top of a tree to our left.&nbsp; Amazingly, it was a Pel's Fishing Owl.&nbsp; He remained on the branch in full view for about 3 or 4 minutes and even turned with his back to us and rotated his head around to peer at us.&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In my book, I do not have the Pel's Fishing Owl's distribution&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Tana Delta.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Have others seen a Pel's Fishing Owl in the Tana Delta or on the coast? </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks for any comments or feedback, </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
