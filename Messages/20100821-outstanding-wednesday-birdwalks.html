<BR>
Nature Kenya's Wednesday Morning Birdwalks have been outstanding this month. The aftermath of a good rainy season?<BR>
<BR>
At Oloolua Forest at IPR on August 11, we all watched from the bridge as a White-starred Robin bathed in the river below, and within a few minutes we had good views of Hartlaub's Turaco, Narina Trogon, Pygmy Kingfisher and Grey Apalis.<BR>
<BR>
At Paradise Lost on August 18 we saw or heard a remarkable 74 species of birds! (OK, we stayed a bit later than usual, about 3 hours in total, and stopped first at the seasonal pool in the Paradise Lost coffee estate.) <BR>
<BR>
We saw the following birds with nests or young:<BR>
Little Grebe &#8211; feeding a begging juvenile<BR>
Great Cormorant &#8211; 12 active nests on dead tree <BR>
Common Moorhen &#8211; one immature<BR>
Red-knobbed Coot &#8211; sitting on nest with tiny fiery-headed chick<BR>
Grey Crowned Crane &#8211; 4 nearly full-grown immatures with 1 adult (or sub-adult)<BR>
African Jacana &#8211; several juveniles<BR>
Pied Kingfisher &#8211; nesting in hole in the bank<BR>
Cinnamon-chested Bee-eater &#8211; a few immatures<BR>
White-headed Barbet &#8211; a pair, including the one with the white back, excavating a hole in a tree near the dam<BR>
White-starred Robin &#8211; one with immature plumage <BR>
<BR>
Wishing you good birding, Fleur<BR>
