<DIV>Hello all,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I'm Dieter Van den Heuvel from Belgium. I am a&nbsp;birdwatcher that visited Kenya for 16 days last month. We visited Kenya with a group of 6 birders that had absolutely no experience with the Kenian birdlife, so I guess you can imagine it was very difficult for us&nbsp;to identify some of the birds that were in winter plumage. We took pictures of most of the birds we saw, but for some we don't succeed in pointing out the species. That's why we are looking for some ID-help. I hope I'm not "abusing" this e-mail list and&nbsp;if so please please let me know and&nbsp;ignore my e-mail. I was just hoping that someone could help us with identifying the birds that are in the attached images. All pictures were taken on July 21st in Nairobi NP. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>thanks in advance</DIV>
