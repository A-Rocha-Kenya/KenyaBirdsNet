  <pre>  Sorry for the previous mail -- I&#39;ll try to delete it before it reaches 
you. This list accepts attachments but deletes any pictures inside the 
mail quietly :-(

This Wednesday&#39;s morning bird walk led us to Ngong Race Course where one 
group explored the region around the dams next to the entrance. In this 
region we repeatedly saw a huge bird of prey, probably a juvenile 
crowned eagle. I am not going to describe this bird in layman&#39;s words, 
just have a look.
If you are interested, I can provide better resolution on request (and 
to a robust mail box only).
For identification this should be fine.

Happy Birding,
Georg
