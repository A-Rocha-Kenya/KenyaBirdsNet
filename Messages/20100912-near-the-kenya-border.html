  <pre>He all,

After 5 days spent in the masai village of Engikerati (North of Arusha, Tanzania, near Namanga, at the Kenya-Tanzania border), I&#39;ve many photos including the famous restricted endemic Beesley&#39;s Lark.

Such a cute little thing!

Very interesting experience to be there... but no time to tell all the details that time. I&#39;m now updating the website for official launching of the training next week. All the details online on the 20th September!

In the mean time, you may enjoy the lark photos and many more species...

Cheers

Val√©ry
