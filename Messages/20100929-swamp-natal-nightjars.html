  <pre>I have just recently returned from a 3 week trip to Kenya. We finished off by spending six nights at Topi cottage in the Olio Orok conservancy in the Mara. On our first night there we heard what I was certain was a Swamp Nightjar calling, this species is well known to us from bird monitoring work that we have carried out here in the Okavango Delta. 

I was surprised to find on reading up the bird in Stevenson&#39;s reference book that it has not been recorded from the Mara system. The next morning I checked with the guides who were with us and none of them were aware of the species. 

Accordingly two nights later when the bird was again heard calling I walked out into the garden &amp; called the bird up using the tapes I allways travel with. The bird responded immediately &amp; flew in over our heads on a full moon evening giving it&#39;s lovely fluting flight call &amp; then landed in the garden and immediately started giving it&#39;s normal &#34;Chuck, Chuck&#34; ground call. We heard this bird (there could easily have been more than one) calling on five of the six nights that we were staying at Topi cottage. I would like to hear back from the Kenya bird bofs what they think of this record.

Thanks - best regards - Mark Muller &amp; Alison Flatt.
