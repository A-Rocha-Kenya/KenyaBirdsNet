  <hr/>
  <pre>Spent the weekend with the Succulenta Society on the Grant/Outram plot south of Kajiado on the Malepo Hills.It was very dry with long grass, hot in the day and cool in the evenings. There weren&#39;t many succulents ... so lots of time for Karen Plumbe, Heather Elkins and I to look for birds. Highlights were many small parties of Banded Parisoma. There were Tiny Cisticola, huge numbers of Emerald Spotted Wood dove (we had 13 in one tree beside a house with a water supply) many Red-fronted Barbets, a pair of Africa Hawk Eagles, a Pygmy Falcon, lots of swifts and martins, a Southern Grosbeak Canary and a Pink Breasted Lark.
