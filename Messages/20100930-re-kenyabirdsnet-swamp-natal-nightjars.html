  Hi Mark and Alison,<br><br>I hope you enjoyed your time at the Beaton&#39;s place; I&#39;ve yet to visit but hear it is stunning!<br><br>I&#39;m based in the central Masai Mara Reserve and have also been hearing Swamp Nightjar all season (mid-August onwards). I&#39;ve also had brief flight views at dusk but no decent images to speak of yet. As you say, it&#39;s off course according to F&amp;S but it&#39;s certainly here.<br>
<br>Alastair Kilpin, who used to work in nearby Siana Springs area, also reported this bird&#39;s presence to me a few months back when I first arrived here.<br><br>I&#39;d be very keen to see your list from your Mara visit if you get the time.<br>
<br>Warmest regards,<br><br>Adam Scott Kennedy<br>Naibor Camp, Masai Mara<br><br><br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On 29 September 2010 20:53, mullerm_52 <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:mullerflatt@botsnet.bw">mullerflatt@botsnet.bw</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>

      <p>I have just recently returned from a 3 week trip to Kenya. We finished off by spending six nights at Topi cottage in the Olio Orok conservancy in the Mara. On our first night there we heard what I was certain was a Swamp Nightjar calling, this species is well known to us from bird monitoring work that we have carried out here in the Okavango Delta. <br>

<br>
I was surprised to find on reading up the bird in Stevenson&#39;s reference book that it has not been recorded from the Mara system. The next morning I checked with the guides who were with us and none of them were aware of the species. <br>

<br>
Accordingly two nights later when the bird was again heard calling I walked out into the garden &amp; called the bird up using the tapes I allways travel with. The bird responded immediately &amp; flew in over our heads on a full moon evening giving it&#39;s lovely fluting flight call &amp; then landed in the garden and immediately started giving it&#39;s normal &quot;Chuck, Chuck&quot; ground call. We heard this bird (there could easily have been more than one) calling on five of the six nights that we were staying at Topi cottage. I would like to hear back from the Kenya bird bofs what they think of this record.<br>

<br>
Thanks - best regards - Mark Muller &amp; Alison Flatt.<br>
