  <pre>On tuesday of the 7th oct this year. i had been doing birding trip with a keen guest from Uk and we had agreat list of birds as water birds, number of ducks species  whiteface whistling ducks, Fluvous whistling ducks, comb duck, Little grebe and few african pigym goose being my favourite bird. we saw a duck relative to a little grebe and the details we had is that it was slightly big than little grebe, its head shape was slightly coverd down towards the face while the grebe was round coved, the neck being duck coloured. we called it Eared grebe. it is my lifer bird to this site. As zimmerman guide book it indicates the bird is found at Tsavo region, could it be the first sighting?. 
other thing i have noted at the site is that over fishing and the birds are time to time being flashed as the fishermen pushing the fish towards the nets.
there was a nesting of black winged stilt sitting on the nest, i wished to go and see if it is breeding or at a rest , though i could not go close as it was on the water and nest made of stuff of water lilly.
Remarks and comments please so as to help me on the guiding activites and confirmation towards guest on the checklist and distribution of the birds.
