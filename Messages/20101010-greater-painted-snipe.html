  <pre>Greetings

Paradise Lost in Kiambu did not disappoint when Mike Davidson, Joseph
Kariuki, Shailesh and Bhavisha Patel and I visited on October 9. The
seasonal pond in the coffee estate was still brimming with birds, the young
of White-backed Duck, Red-knobbed Coot and African Jacana now older and more
active. Another pair of coots had 3 tiny chicks.

New records on this visit included two Spur-winged Geese and a beautiful
Greater Painted-snipe (Peter Usher had also seen Greater Painted-snipe at
Brookside Dairies last week.)

On the main grounds, the wide variety of birds included migrant Spotted
Flycatchers and Willow Warblers; Grey-Olive Greenbul below the waterfall;
and a pair of Green-capped Eremomela.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
