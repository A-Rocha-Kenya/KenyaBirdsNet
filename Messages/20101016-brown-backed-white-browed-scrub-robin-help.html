  <pre>Hi all,

I already tried 5 forums... nobody really give me an answer on this Scrub-Robin (second line).

http://www.valeryschollaert.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1096&amp;Itemid=387

I heard un unknown song (despite I know White-browed very well) and I saw that bird. While into view I thought it is a White-browed with a local accent. I took a photo to check in case...

Now the only think I notice on the photo is the dark wing with narrow wing bars matching Brown-backed. 

Please help

Val√©ry
