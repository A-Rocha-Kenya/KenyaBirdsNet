  <pre>This is really a wonderful find Martin, well done. There is no doubt
that the one of the birds in the photos are an adult male Weyn&#39;s
Weavers in full breeding dress. An incredible find
Best for now

&gt; Dear all,
&gt;
&gt; see Martin Odino&#39;s original e-mail and photos below.
&gt;
&gt; this record, once submitted and approved (which won&#39;t be a problem at
&gt; all...)
&gt; would be the first confirm record for the species in Kenya.
&gt;
&gt; well done Martin and hope that these birds will stay for a while.

&gt;
&gt; Dear BC et al,
&gt;
&gt; I believe you are all well.I need your counsel on the identity of the
&gt; attached
&gt; images.
&gt; I took the photos of the 2 individuals today from Sio Port Swamp (KE IBA
&gt; 60).
&gt; The subjects were perched aloof from the rest of the weavers (Village and
&gt; Yellow-backed, mostly) that were feeding on the cultivated millet and
&gt; grass-weed
&gt; seeds (i guess) in a mixed cropped piece of land bordering the swamp.
&gt;
&gt; Regards
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Martin
