<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Last month sunday birdwalk was a trip around Lukenya area which was lead by Fleur. Good number of species were seen like Red-throated Tit. We saw 4 different species of raptors like Gabar Goshawk - 1, Verreaux's Eagle - 2, African Hawk-Eagle - 2 and Martial Eagle - 1.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>For palaearctic migrants, we had Barn Swallows, Northern Wheatears and a good number of Eurasian Golden Orioles.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>A big thank you to Brian Finch, Colin Jackson and Bernd de Bruijn for helping me&nbsp;in ID the palaearctic migrant that we saw at splash on the Wednesday Morning Birdwalk&nbsp;which was a&nbsp;Thrush Nightingale also known as Sprosser.</DIV>
