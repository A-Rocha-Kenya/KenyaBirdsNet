  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Hello Birders,</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">March at Naibor in the Masai Mara has been an interesting one for me. Mostly I have been getting to know the camp, staff and general lie of the land around here and still have many exciting places to explore in the coming months, especially the Musiara Swamp and Kichwa Tembo areas.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Nevertheless, birding in and around the camp has been productive, especially for my favourite family of birds – the cuckoos. In particular, the camp has produced two immature Levaillant’s Cuckoo; one was still being fed by its hosts, a family of Arrow-marked Babblers, early in the month and the other was already independent when I arrived at the end of Feb. I also saw a dark morph adult bird at the start of March but not since. A single Jacobin Cuckoo (age not determined) was in the camp mid-month and a recently fledged Red-chested Cuckoo was harassed by the local Paradise Flycatchers on 20<sup>th</sup>. At least one adult R-c Cuckoo was heard calling throughout the month in camp. The smaller “emerald” cuckoos have also been evident with all three - Emerald, Klaas’ and Diederik - calling at some stage during March. At least the latter two have produced young locally. On one of my morning bird walks with guests, I had the three species sitting in the same tree – which was a great help when pointing out the ID features. On that same day, there were a pair of African Cuckoo also floating around but I have yet to hear this species call in/around camp.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A favourite with our guests are the Schalow’s Turaco which feed each morning on the various fruiting trees around the mess tent. Spectacular birds that show very well here.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Grey crowned Crane – at least three pairs including one with two 2-week old chicks mid-month</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Black-faced Sandgrouse – a pair seen on the ground close to car before taking flight and landing 400m away, close to Entim Camp on 26th. It was the first time my guides had encountered this species in the Mara (although my Samburu guide knew it well from his home district). Can someone advise me if they are regular here or otherwise?</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Eurasian Bee-eater – several small groups passing over all month. Best sighting was of 20+ heading south (!) over Lookout Hill on 5<sup>th</sup>.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Crowned Hornbill – one by Ol Kiombo crossing on 27<sup>th</sup>. Like B-f Sandgrouse, this is a species I was not expecting to encounter here.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Greater Honeyguide – at least one immature bird, showing off its lemon throat, in camp during the month as well as two different adults calling. During severe storms on 28<sup>th</sup>, a bee’s nest was exposed after its tree collapsed. At least two Greater and three Lesser Honeyguides feasted together on the honeycomb (left by our sweet-toothed staff!) at the same time.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Golden-tailed Woodpecker – one bird heard then seen in front of camp mid-month. We have regular sightings of Nubian and Cardinal WP’s in camp.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Rufous-chested Swallow – at least one pair nesting underground (possibly in a Warthog burrow) close to Irish Bridge.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Grey-capped Warbler – probably not scarce but a beautiful lifer for me! At least one bird proclaiming territory noisily close to Mess area in camp all month.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Lesser Grey Shrike – a single nr Entim camp on 26<sup>th</sup></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">House Sparrow – abundant in Talek village. What is the status of this bird in the Mara; always abundant or a recent arrival from the east?</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB">Jackson</span><span lang="EN-GB">’s Widowbird – another smart lifer for me. Just four birds seen together so far, near Irish Bridge, but my guides report larger numbers during their safaris elsewhere in the reserve. Also, Fan-tailed, Red-collared, Yellow-mantled and White-winged seen in March – all in breeding dress. </span></font></font></p>

Sadly, they had moved on by the next day. A Squacco Heron perched in front of mess on 2<sup>nd</sup> was also well-received.</font></span></div>
