  <pre>Hi Mark and Alison,
I was going to suggest you contact Adam as he has been seeing them
around Naibor since he has been there. Also they arrived at Klein&#39;s
Camp in northern Serengeti for the first time a couple of years ago,
so it seems the species is spreading out from the vicinity of Lake
Victoria.
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Hi Mark and Alison,
&gt;
&gt; I hope you enjoyed your time at the Beaton&#39;s place; I&#39;ve yet to visit but
&gt; hear it is stunning!
&gt;
&gt; I&#39;m based in the central Masai Mara Reserve and have also been hearing Swamp
&gt; Nightjar all season (mid-August onwards). I&#39;ve also had brief flight views
&gt; at dusk but no decent images to speak of yet. As you say, it&#39;s off course
&gt; according to F&amp;S but it&#39;s certainly here.
&gt;
&gt; Alastair Kilpin, who used to work in nearby Siana Springs area, also
&gt; reported this bird&#39;s presence to me a few months back when I first arrived
&gt; here.
&gt;
&gt; I&#39;d be very keen to see your list from your Mara visit if you get the time.
&gt;
&gt; Warmest regards,
&gt;
&gt; Adam Scott Kennedy
&gt; Naibor Camp, Masai Mara

&gt;&gt; I have just recently returned from a 3 week trip to Kenya. We finished off
&gt;&gt; by spending six nights at Topi cottage in the Olio Orok conservancy in the
&gt;&gt; Mara. On our first night there we heard what I was certain was a Swamp
&gt;&gt; Nightjar calling, this species is well known to us from bird monitoring
&gt;&gt; work
&gt;&gt; that we have carried out here in the Okavango Delta.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I was surprised to find on reading up the bird in Stevenson&#39;s reference
&gt;&gt; book that it has not been recorded from the Mara system. The next morning
&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt; checked with the guides who were with us and none of them were aware of
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; species.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Accordingly two nights later when the bird was again heard calling I
&gt;&gt; walked
&gt;&gt; out into the garden &amp; called the bird up using the tapes I allways travel
&gt;&gt; with. The bird responded immediately &amp; flew in over our heads on a full
&gt;&gt; moon
&gt;&gt; evening giving it&#39;s lovely fluting flight call &amp; then landed in the garden
&gt;&gt; and immediately started giving it&#39;s normal &#34;Chuck, Chuck&#34; ground call. We
&gt;&gt; heard this bird (there could easily have been more than one) calling on
&gt;&gt; five
&gt;&gt; of the six nights that we were staying at Topi cottage. I would like to
&gt;&gt; hear
&gt;&gt; back from the Kenya bird bofs what they think of this record.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks - best regards - Mark Muller &amp; Alison Flatt.
&gt;&gt;
