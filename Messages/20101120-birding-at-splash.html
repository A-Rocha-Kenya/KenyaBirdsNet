<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>On Wednesday birdwalk, we went to splash. We saw a good number of migrants like Willow Warbler, Common Rock Thrush, Common Cuckoo, Spotted Flycatcher, Northern Wheatear, Common Buzzard and&nbsp;Booted Eagle.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>What we saw not sure a Thrush Nightingale or Nightingale. This species had a rufous tail until the rump and cock it's tail. Please have a look at the photo which is attached. Some of the other birders had also taken pictures of this species.</DIV>
