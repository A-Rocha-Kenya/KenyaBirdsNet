  <pre>Dear All,

Two more adult female Amur Falcons have crossed the Indian Ocean on a track 
of ca. 2600 - 2800 kms. They left India not far from Bombay and arrived 
this morning in Somalia. They migrated  south of Socotra island. The were not 
travelling together but on similar tracks several hundred kilometers south of 
their tracks in spring when they had crossed the Indian Ocean on return 
migration to their breeding areas in NE-China.

According to the weather data we have been able to collect the conditions 
were not always very good on this non-stop transoceanic flight.

One would have expected them to be exausted once arrived  in Africa, but 
they continued to migrate further south in Somalia like the first bird which 
has moved from Kenya to Tanzania during the last few days.

Another adult male has recently left his stop-over area in NE- India. The 
bird is now crossing the Indian sub-continent. We expect it soon  to start 
crossing the ocean. The first three birds apparently hardly ever stopped once 
they had left NE-India.

There exists a picture of this male bird with its 5 g satellite tag:

We thank all the people who have written to us and apologise for not beeing 
able to answer to all the mails. There are just the two of us to evaluate 
all the tracking data of this and many other birds in our very limited spare 
time. At the same time we have to collect the weather data from many sources 
which are often only easily available for few hours.

Several people have sent nice photos of Amur Falcons. Many thanks. Others 
have sent observations of migrating Amurs which are very much appreciated. It 
seems that in most cases theses birds travel in flocks of some dozends to 
few hundred individuals. More observation will be more than welcome.

We collect all data for later evaluation. Please understand  that right now 
we cannot evaluate and communicate all the details.

Somebody asked if the one bird mentioned in an earlier mail migrated via 
Hongkong. All we can say is that it migrated along or close to the coast and 
not too far from Hongkong. Theses tiny PTTs do not collect GPS fixes. 
Argos/Doppler locations are not always very precise. They therefore need individual 
evalution which is very time consuming.


With kind regards,
