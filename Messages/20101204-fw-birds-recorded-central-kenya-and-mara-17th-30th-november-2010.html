 All,<br>I have just returned from a two week bird-tour from just Central<br>Kenya, and am posting this just before I start another tour in a<br>couple of days time… so it is a bit rushed.<br>We started the tour on Nov 17th, in Nairobi NP, which was a bit<br>ovelwhelming for clients who had over 100 new birds on their first<br>day. The Park was moist from early morning misty showers but not wet.<br>The highlights were a Black Stork, pair of Saddle-billed Storks, and a<br>Nairobi Pipit. Although we recorded over 150 species in the Park,<br>there was nothing locally exciting. The highlight for me was the four<br>metre Rock Python at Hyaena Dam, a magnificent beast. We also started<br>the tour early with Lions.<br>The next morning (18th), we investigated Lukenya, which was green and<br>lush, and there were lots of birds. The Verreaux’s Eagles have<br>successfully raised a nearly independent young, which is great news.<br>The are also provided African
 Penduline Tits, Southern Grosbeak<br>Canarys, and a Bush Pipit which seem to be a regular feature there<br>nowadays, whereas it is a long time since I have heard a squeak from<br>Lyne’s Cisticolas although I can see no reason for their<br>disappearance. From here we took the Machakos road, there was an<br>active colony of Black-headed Herons, Cattle Egrets and Sacred Ibis,<br>just near the Makuyuni turn-off. We had Lizard Buzzard which was<br>unexpected, and a Booted Eagle which was not a surprise. Before<br>entering Tsavo West, we visited the pool along the road to the Tsavo<br>East entrance at Mtito Andei. There were a number of birds here, but<br>the pool is not a magnet as there is much standing water in the area.<br>A Mottled Spinetail came in for a drink though. At the Museum/Picnic<br>area were a host of species, and amongst them an Olive Tree, a Basra<br>Reed, and a couple of Barred Warblers. The Black-headed Plovers were<br>there as always,
 and just along the road we encountered our first<br>adult Sooty Falcon. The road was dripping in nightjars as we<br>approached Ngulia, some forty Eurasian, six Plain, and one each of<br>Dusky and Donaldson-Smith’s mean a very slow progress towards the<br>lodge! Such a poor showing for the last two may be related to the<br>moister conditions than usual this relatively early in the season. Who<br>knows the vagaries of nightjar movements. There was as usual Eurasian<br>Nightjars on beams in the restaurant.<br><br>The morning of the 18th was a misty start, but the near full moon<br>meant that the migrants had not been attracted by the lights. At<br>breakfast we had a Eurasian Sparrowhawk in the area, and an Upcher’s<br>Warbler feeding in a bush. Otherwise it was quiet. We descended into<br>the lowlands, where things were different. Bushes were pulsating with<br>Sprossers and Whitethroats, but other migrants were very low in<br>numbers. We only found two
 Grasshopper Buzzards, and one Eurasian<br>Cuckoo whereas more would have been expected by now. Even more<br>surprisingly we only had one Marsh Warbler the whole trip! Eurasian<br>Rollers by contrast were in large numbers and clustering on many<br>bushes. The damp conditions bought numbers of Vulturine Guineafowl out<br>onto the road, and of the resident species it was a case that they had<br>bred and many were with their flying young, so quite silent. Not so<br>the numerous Pringle’s Puffbacks and Red-naped Bush-Shrikes however,<br>although not as easy to see as usual. There was a scattering of<br>Madagascar Bee-eaters in the scrub, which is quite a regular feature<br>at this time of year. They were in breeding plumage but still their<br>obviously local nesting site remains a mystery. We gradually picked up<br>other local specialities such as Scaly Chatterer and Pale Prinia as<br>well as many more widespread Somali-biome species. There were
 also<br>some pallid Red-faced Crombecs that may well be leading to a<br>mis-reporting of Somali Long-billed Crombec.<br>In the afternoon we tried our luck at the Hippo Pool near Ngulia.<br>There was a good number of species attracted to the water, and whilst<br>we were there a Leopard was slaking it’s thirst in broad daylight. A<br>Black-crowned Night-Heron was hiding in a bush that Golden-backed<br>Weavers were showing an interest in.<br><br>We were due to leave on the 19th, and returned to the lowlands for the<br>final morning, circling around to exit through Chyulu Gate. In the<br>grasslands we stopped for a posing Red-winged Lark by the road, and in<br>doing so heard Friedmann’s Lark and after some searching located three<br>birds in the area, coaxed into more song by playback. At the gate were<br>a number of species which included Black-headed Batis and<br>Black-bellied Sunbird. The skies were darkening, and there was<br>obviously some heavy
 rain ahead. As we arrived at the drenched site,<br>we could not believe our eyes, the sky, ground and bushes were<br>literally dripping in falcons and rollers. There were birds not only<br>all around us, but similar swarms could be seen in the distance, and<br>the birds continually arrived from the north to join in the feeding<br>frenzy on emerging termites. It is so difficult to estimate large<br>concentrations of independently (as opposed to dense flocking) flying<br>birds, but we estimated that there was something like 2500 Amur<br>Falcons at the location not too far from their traditional transit<br>roost on the slopes of Kilimanjaro. That would have been quite a<br>spectacle tonight, I hope that there was someone there to enjoy it and<br>count the birds. Diligent searching revealed amongst them, three<br>Eleonoras, two Sootys but unbelievably only one Hobby!!! The roadside<br>wires were a writhing mass of resting Barn Swallows gathering in
 their<br>thousands and completely obliterating the wire as if they were<br>migrants moving north not south. Nearing the end of the Shaitani Road<br>there was a very active colony of about thirty pairs of White-fronted<br>Bee-eaters, and possibly more. At the forest for the greater part<br>felled for tomato production we still managed to find Brown-hooded<br>Kingfisher, Red-capped Robin-Chat and Grey-olive Greenbuls. Eventually<br>we arrived at the Kimana Gate to Amboseli. Here there was a not too<br>pleasant character that said that although I had my citizens KWS<br>Smart-Card, if I did not produce either an Identity Card or Passport,<br>I would be charged Ksh6000 to enter. Once again we have to pay for KWS<br>stupidity in having omitted the personal photo on the card, and have<br>the inconvenience of having to produce further identification. I did<br>not like this mans attitude and he seemed quite put-out when I<br>produced my Kenyan
 Passport!!!<br><br>Whilst the night had been quite clear, the morning of the 20th was<br>gloomy, cold and grey with no mountain in sight. We left in the<br>morning, checking out the car-park where there was an activity in the<br>Taveta Golden Weaver colony, with displaying males under the nests,<br>and as in other years the worlds most extravert Nightingales. Then we<br>spent a further fifteen minutes studying a piece of disturbed ground<br>that was an attraction for birds. There was a Eurasian Hoopoe feeding<br>with relatives, and a White Wagtail with several Yellow Wagtails, a<br>few Pangani Longclaws and a variety of waders. It was disappointing to<br>see that there was no Causeway Lagoon, it was long dry and a grassy<br>swathe. On the lake was a good assortment of swamp birds with a few<br>Shoveler and Garganey and a variety of waders that included a single<br>Little Ringed Plover. There were a few migrant Harriers of three<br>species, but otherwise
 single Hobby and Peregrine. On the way to the<br>main gate we had extremely close-up views of Short-tailed, Athi<br>Short-toed and Singing Bush Larks, and two Rufous Bush-Chats in<br>roadside scrub. At the gate, which had just been washed (!), leaving a<br>puddle was wild activity with a good variety and impressive numbers of<br>birds swarming in to slake their thirst. This included both<br>Silverbills, Cut-throats and Chestnut Sparrows. In the afternoon we<br>only added a few species, Blue-cheeked Bee-eaters were in the<br>bulrushes, and two Black Herons were feeding along the marsh. A lone<br>male Amur Falcon looked a bit sad after the concentration of the<br>previous afternoon!<br><br>Mount Kilimanjaro was spectacular, and had a shroud of snow. Before<br>flying off to Nanyuki in the morning (21st), we drove out towards the<br>main gate again to look for White-headed Mousebirds and found three.<br>Also large numbers of sandgrouse were in the air, and
 we had all three<br>local species on the road. Then off to Nanyuki via a change in Nairobi<br>and we were soon enjoying freshly brewed coffee at Barney’s on Nanyuki<br>Airstrip, and afterwards whisked away to Mountain Lodge.<br>In the afternoon we birded from the roof, but it was so quiet apart<br>from a trio of Oriole Finches.<br><br>We had another look from the roof on the morning of 22nd, enjoying the<br>beautiful morning complete with snow-clad top to Mt Kenya. After<br>breakfast we left for the Met Station above Naro Moru. We spent the<br>day on the mountain seeing an amazing twenty-two Jackson’s Francolins.<br>Many had chicks, and were as low as two-kilometres from the gate.<br>Otherwise it was the usual suspects with Mountain Buzzards, Hill Chats<br>and Tacazze Sunbirds.<br><br>On the 23rd another look at the roof before leaving added more montane<br>species, and a very nice displaying Cuckoo-Hawk. Before reaching the<br>gate there was a
 Doherty’s Bush-Shrike calling at some distance, but<br>it remained a frustrating voice. We descended finding still nice<br>montane species like Kandt’s Waxbill, and Long-tailed Widowbirds in<br>full regalia in the fields (with some nice Jackson’s and Red-collared<br>for company).<br>After lunch at Naro Moru we set off along the road crossing Solio<br>Plains. Falcons were in evidence but not numerous, very approachable<br>Amurs and Greater Kestrels, as well as Eurasian and Lesser Kestrels,<br>the three migrant Harriers, a very nice gathering of some 150 Caspian<br>Plovers (the first I have seen here), a poor showing of Yellow<br>Wagtails, Wheatears and Whinchats whilst migrant shrikes non-exisent.<br>It was nice to see that really the presence of the IDP’s was not<br>having as yet, a drastic affect on the birds.<br><br>Another beautiful morning awaited us on 24th, as we had a morning look<br>around the gardens. We found a few birds, but migrants
 were almost<br>non-existent. Surprises were a very noisy flock of 15 Athi (maybe even<br>Somali) Short-toed Larks flying over, but the vepres Black-lored<br>Babblers are now a feature of the place.<br>Back across Solio Plains there were five Blue-cheeked Bee-eaters<br>sitting on the fence, but it appeared that all of the Caspian Plovers<br>had gone. We met up with Paul Murithi with two Mackinder’s Eagle-Owls<br>and a Red-throated Wryneck before continuing for a picnic at Ndaragwa.<br>The swamp near Nyahururu was not too lively but there was a group of<br>Common Snipe. We birded towards Baringo with stops at the Falls where<br>there were Slender-billed Starlings, Golden-winged Sunbirds in<br>roadside Leonotis finally arriving at our destination.<br><br>It’s always nice to see the dawn at Baringo as we walked the gardens<br>on the morning of the 25th. The Lake was close to the wall, not a<br>trace of the Prosopis forest remains, no shoreline which
 reduces the<br>species, and Hippos sitting on the submerged jetty which cannot be<br>good for it! The gardens showed a dearth of migrants apart from<br>Blue-cheeked Bee-eaters and a few swallows. The nice lone African<br>Scops Owl has relocated, but was still waiting for us. The bird-table<br>at breakfast was entertaining. Northern Masked Weavers still being in<br>full breeding dress, whilst all others were a bit on the patchy side.<br>We set off to find Francis who was out staking the shopping-list out<br>for us. We went unaccompanied to the escarpment first seeing all the<br>usual residents (never see Yellow-billed Hornbill there nowadays), as<br>well as a nice pair of Lead-coloured Flycatchers and a group of real<br>northern Black-cheeked Waxbills (as opposed to the kiwanukae mess we<br>have along the southern border). Suddenly I noticed a silvery bird<br>flying above the cliff, I watched it for a while thinking what on<br>earth is that falcon with
 its white underwings, staggeringly<br>contrasting black wing tips and a long black protrusion from the<br>second primary along the leading edge. I am not sure how long it took,<br>but a sudden realisation suddenly hit me. Levant Sparrowhawk I blurted<br>out wondering if I had done the right thing, but it was, a superb<br>adult male in all its glory in the bright morning light. A photo was<br>hurriedly taken but I was more interested in enjoying this, my first<br>ever adult male Levant. Suddenly a resident Shikra took offence and<br>flew after it, with the broad non-contrasting wing-tips of aggressor<br>weaving at the streamlined streaking intruder, it was a great<br>comparison as they wheeled and dipped along the cliffs, before the<br>Levant left the area. I had always considered that it would be a<br>problem identifying a male Levant from a male Shikra, there is no<br>doubt when you see a male Levant. The beautiful silvery underwing and<br>that
 arresting black tipping intruding along the leading edge. The<br>almost falcon-like pointedness to the wings, what a bird! I have<br>attached an image to this posting. We left the escarpment and met up<br>with Francis and William at the Greyish Eagle-Owls which peered<br>disinterestedly down on us. There was a large Olive Tree Warbler in a<br>bush nearby, and a family of Heuglin’s Coursers under the same bushes.<br>Francis told me that two days before he had found a Star-spotted<br>Nightjar, but although they searched for it the previous day they<br>could not relocate it. We planned to have a go and left for a school<br>ground some two kilometers back up the road towards Marigat. On<br>stepping out of the vehicle we soon found Slender-tailed Nightjars,<br>and another two Heuglin’s Coursers. Soon we flushed a broad-winged<br>nightjar. It was very beautiful with delicate orange secondaries<br>contrasting with a silvery-grey back, white corners to tail
 and white<br>across the primaries of course. A most attractive Nubian Nightjar. The<br>bird was very flighty and although we watched it on the ground, it<br>would not let us approach too closely. We left it and continued our<br>search and soon up went an extremely dark nightjar with small white<br>corners to the tail. It landed and was more approachable than the<br>Nubian, there it was, a Star-spotted Nightjar and a lifer for Edwin<br>who was grinning ecstatically. We watched, digitised and videod the<br>bird for some time before leaving it. An image of the bird is attached<br>to this. I must admit, I was always rather sceptical of previous<br>claims from this area. Really, whilst it was in lava, it used the<br>bushes for cover, unlike birds I am familiar with in the north of the<br>country where they are on open black lava ridges. I went on to the net<br>to see if there were any good images out there, and came across a nice<br>photo of one taken by
 Moses of the Birding Club of Baringo who posted<br>it to a forum. I actually don’t know of either Moses of the Baringo<br>Birding Club. It is possible that Baringo may have Star-spotteds on<br>more regular basis than the records suggest. Next we had three<br>Liechtenstein’s Sandgrouse relying on camouflage rather than flight<br>and in the same place a pair of Northern White-faced Scops Owls peered<br>at us from an acacia. We returned for lunch, there were a couple of<br>Northern Carmine Bee-eaters on the jetty and we left shortly<br>afterwards. I think this has to me my best ever day at Baringo and yet<br>the lake is so disappointing as it is too full. A year ago I never<br>thought I would write that a lake was too full! We arrived in the<br>evening at Nakuru.<br><br>Back to the gloomy and cool mornings on the 26th. It lifted early to a<br>grey day, but then no heat haze on the Lake which was an advantage,<br>although mid morning the sun won
 through. The lake is so high, and old<br>roads are now part of it, but there is so much habitat for birds much<br>of which is inaccessible. There were a couple of hundred Cape Teal,<br>with a few Shoveler, Pintail and Garganey amongst them. Several<br>hundred Black-necked Grebe are at the southern end, where they are in<br>very close to the shore. We had one out of water preening on a grassy<br>bank. It looked for all the world as if it belonged in Europe, as it<br>was in what appeared to be typical northern winter plumage, the only<br>colour being the improbable red eye. All of the other Black-necks we<br>looked at were in the typical permanent breeding dress that we are<br>used to. There is not supposed to be a non-breeding dress in the<br>sub-saharan race, but I have photos to prove that this can occur as I<br>doubt if a palearctic has made it this far down. Lesser Flamingo<br>numbers were not disappointing and as spectacular as ever, there
 were<br>over a thousand Greater Flamingos with them. White Pelicans are back<br>as an impressive spectacle, and a lone Pink-back was roosting in a<br>tree! A sprinkling of migrant raptors, very few Harriers and only five<br>Aquilas with nothing of note. Muyas Causeway is full, and bordered by<br>lush grass. Birds were using it, but not too much that was noteworthy.<br>There was an adult Lesser Moorhen here and over forty Long-tailed<br>Widowbirds. The usual swallows were not at all in evidence. Pied<br>Avocets were only in one flock on the north shore, where there were<br>some 150, otherwise waders were in very good numbers but not the<br>variety. Not more than fifteen Ringed Plover were seen, but there were<br>two Little Rings in the freshwater soak on the south shore. What is<br>presumably the same Ruddy Turnstone was still present from two weeks<br>earlier. Ruff were really hard to estimate, numbers were between 5 and<br>15 thousand, the flocks must
 be seen to be believed, whilst the next<br>commonest was Little Stint with over a thousand, whilst we could only<br>muster three Curlew Sandpipers. Marsh Sandpipers were over a hundred,<br>and Wood Sandpipers were commonly scattered throughout. Whiskered and<br>Gull-billed greatly outnumbered White-winged Black Terns, and<br>Grey-headed was the only gull species present. Away from the lake we<br>found a single Blue-spotted Wood-Dove, a lone Broad-billed Roller,<br>five suspect Grey-crested Helmetshrikes, a solitary female<br>Slender-billed Starling bathing at Makalia Falls, and a Grey Wagtail.<br><br>We left for our long drive to the Mara on the 27th, unlike the<br>previous day this one was beautiful and birds were very vocal as we<br>left Nakuru. Our first stop was a breeding colony of Angola Swallows<br>in a church at Njoro, then we stopped for Levaillant’s Cisticolas at a<br>swamp near the railway bridge. On the Molo grasslands we found
 several<br>each of Sharpe’s Longclaws, Aberdare and Wing-snapping Cisticolas,<br>whilst Common Quail were calling from the fields of crops. At Chagaik<br>we had our picnic with a few westerner’s with dapper Luhder’s<br>Bush-Shrikes and a surprising number of Stuhlmann’s Starlings. A stop<br>near Litein for the extralimital Yellow-backed Weavers, then it was<br>off to Kichwa Tembo, where we arrived, ate then slumped into the<br>luxury of the tents.<br><br>A Mara morning greeted us on 28th, big fiery ball, opening scene fro<br>Lion King and all that. It was all there, plains full of assorted<br>mammals, and the birds did not disappoint as we ambled along in the<br>gardens. After breakfast we looked at the forested slopes of the<br>Sabaringo. The biggest surprise here was a group of eight Crested<br>Guineafowls. It is some twenty years since I have seen or heard them<br>here. Some twenty-five Grey-throated Barbets were gorging themselves<br>in a
 feeding frenzy in a fruiting tree. There were a few<br>Yellow-bellied Hyliotas, Trilling Cisticolas, Green-capped Eremomelas,<br>Pale Wren Warblers and Red-tailed Chats in exactly the same spot.<br>It was on the descent that we heard a scub-robin singing. “That’s a<br>Brown-backed Scrub-Robin,” says Edwin. “It does sound like one but<br>they are not in the Mara,” I said. Edwin replied that he had seen them<br>on a few occasions recently. So we tried to see the bird that was<br>singing like a Brown-backed and had another replying with identical<br>phrases at some distance. We watched the bird and sure enough Edwin<br>was perfectly correct it was a Brown-backed Scrub-Robin. I had never<br>come across them in all my birding in the Mara, but here they were on<br>Kichwas doorstep. In the lodge I mentioned them to the birding<br>management, and they said that recently they have been coming into the<br>camp itself! In the afternoon we went through
 Oloololo Gate, where<br>they are wasting money on a Kaps Barrier across the road where you<br>have to get a Transit Ticket to enter through Oloololo Gate where you<br>still have to have the usual tickets. The reason for Kaps being in the<br>Mara is definitely eluding me. Trans Mara are getting a bad, and<br>seemingly deserved press which is bringing about a tour-operators<br>boycott on the area. It is very birder unfriendly at present with all<br>the roads to the Serena Oxbows being blocked off, with a heavy fine<br>for transgressing. The most alarming tale is that some drivers from<br>Kichwa found a group of Lions and showed them to their clients.<br>Another vehicle turned up and another and another until there were<br>quite a number present, but behaving considerately. There is a limit<br>of five vehicles now at any animal with a three minute allowance to<br>stay with any animal. Every vehicle got an on the spot fine of Ksh<br>10,000 for being in
 excess of five vehicles, included the ones that<br>found the animals in the first place!!!! Is that a crock or what? We<br>drove on for some fifteen kilometers to the Hippo Pools, the<br>grasslands were like a nuclear winter, there was absolutely nothing.<br><br>With the tour getting close to the final day, on the morning of&nbsp; 29th<br>we had a long period walking the gardens. It was superb with niceties<br>like a couple of very showy Golden-tailed Woodpeckers, the now<br>resident pair of Black-headed Gonoleks and the equally resident<br>Red-capped Robin-Chat. After leaving Kichwa we headed out towards<br>Musiara Swamp. There were Steppe Eagles dotted all over the plain<br>where they were eating emerging temites, we estimated over 150. So it<br>was good to see the numbers back at last. There were five<br>Saddle-billed Storks on the swamp, which included three juveniles,<br>some eight Rufous-bellied Herons, an adult Sooty Falcon, an African<br>Water
 Rail feeding openly, and in the freshly inundated areas waders<br>including Common Snipe and five Long-toed Plovers. Thousands of Common<br>Swifts preceded a downpour, and out on the open plains en route to<br>Intrepids were a hundred Caspian Plover, and something I had never<br>seen before… a Rufous-naped Lark with a rufous nape. I have attached<br>that to this email as well. There were a few Athi Short-toes but no<br>sign of any White-tailed Larks. The Wildebeeste have certainly cropped<br>this area. In the evening we arrived at Siana Springs and it rained<br>and rained, which cancelled our planned night-drive.<br><br>Our final morning on the 30th saw us in the Siana Valley which was<br>birdy as usual. There were some fifteen Magpie Shrikes and they were<br>very vocal, and a pair of Buff-bellied Penduline-Tits were found at<br>their nest, and a number of Tabora Cisticolas were present in mixed<br>assemblages. After a very nice early morning, we flew
 back to Nairobi<br>closing the tour of just Central Kenya (and Mara) at over 600 species,<br>and some great birds amongst that figure.<br><br>Best to all<br>Brian<br></div></div><div style="position:fixed"></div>
