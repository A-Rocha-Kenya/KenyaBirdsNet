The 2010 Ngulia session has just finished and was once again a great
success. David Pearson led the team as usual though I was there with
Bernard Amakobe to set things up a couple of days before David arrived
- this being the 41st year that he has been to Ngulia for the ringing.<br>
<br>
The weather conditions were not bad but also were not fantastic for the
attraction of migrants to the lodge lights but we ended up with a very
satisfactory total of 17,173 birds. The main highlights,apart from an
overwhelming number of Marsh Warblers (over 65% of the catch on some
days!) and 1,631 Barn Swallows and c.60 House Martins, are given below.
I also blogged it and you can read a bit more and see some images from
the time on <a href="http://arochakenya.wildlifedirect.org">http://arochakenya.wildlifedirect.org</a><br>
<br>
A Common Redstart on the 29th Nov - only the 13th ever ringed at Ngulia<br>
Ngulia's second Chiffchaff ringed - 3rd December<br>
1 each of Pied and Isabelline Wheatears<br>
1 Eurasian Scops Owl on 3rd Dec<br>
1 Green Sandpiper - 2nd Dec<br>
3 Common Buttonquail ringed and another 2 seen<br>
A Gambaga Flycatcher on the 1st Dec<br>
Over 30 Donaldson-Smith's Nightjars ringed and three Slender-tailed,
several Plain and Dusky and 9 Eurasian.<br>
A Shikra was caught and ringed<br>
2 Somali Golden-breasted Buntings<br>
<br>
On my way out from Ngulia on the 10th Dec in the early evening and a
heavy rainstorm, I saw 3 scops owls (African? Eurasian?) on the road, 2
Heuglin's Coursers, a Corncrake and the usual nightjars. We had very
few Steppe Eagles through - and were remembering how 15 years ago we
would easily have 50+ in a day passing overhead. I think we would have
been lucky to have had 20 in total for the 2 1/2 weeks this year. I
also didn't see a single vulture in 2 weeks based at Ngulia... We did,
however, have what might be the first ever occasion when no less than
TWO Eurasian Sparrowhawks were seen <u>together</u> just off from the
ringing station by the pool when Brian Finch was visiting. I had
another one on the 10th high over head pumping south.<br>
<br>
Wader-wise, we've had 3 nights of wader ringing on Mida Creek this past
week with a group of Israeli ringers who had been at Ngulia as well. In
total we caught 197 waders of the normal mix of birds though many more
Lesser and Greater Sandplovers than normal in terms of proportion - and
very few Little Stints and Curlew Sands. Most interesting was the
number of old retraps with several from 2004, 2002 and even one Curlew
Sand ringed by Jeff Davis when with me in Nov 1999!<br>
<br>
During the week we had a Bat Hawk over the carpark at the A Rocha Kenya
centre just as we were packing the car to go for the waders. Otherwise
I was asleep in the mornings and in meetings all afternoon!<br>
<br>
Wader ringing again in mid-January if anyone is keen to come and join
in.<br>
<br>
Best wishes,<br>
