  <pre>Season&#39;s greetings

Some sightings from Nature Kenya outings in December 2010:

Racecourse, Nairobi, December 8
Abdim&#39;s Stork - only one seen, unusual, but white back confirms
Palaearctic migrant warblers included Willow Warbler, Blackcap and Common
Whitethroat

Paradise Lost, Kiambu, December 15
White-backed Duck with nearly grown young

Gatamaiyu Forest, Sunday Birdwatch, December 19
It was green and cool and many species were courting, calling, building
nests or feeding fledged young. In particular, we observed a pair of
Black-fronted Bushshrikes, one golden yellow below and the other vivid
orange and yellow, feeding a juvenile, all yellowish green in colour.

Private Garden, Saunders Close, Kitisuru, Nairobi, December 22
Grey-Olive Greenbuls near the stream in the steep valley.

Wishing you happy holidays and a bird-filled 2011, Fleur
