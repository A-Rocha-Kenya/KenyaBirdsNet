<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>European Honey Buzzards are long distance migrants. Little is<br>known about the migration of German breeding birds. Many<br>questions can be answered with the help of satellite telemetry,<br>using state-of-the-art GPS transmitters, which were available to<br>us from 2009. These included questions on habitat use, home<br>range size and flight height and speed etc. </p>
<p><strong>Methods<br></strong>In the time frame 2001 to 2010 we fitted nine adult German<br>Honey Buzzards (six males and three females), primarily in<br>Schleswig-Holstein, with solar cell powered satellite transmitters<br>(PTTs), of various types and producers, weighing 18-22 g. Ten<br>transmitters were used. In the last two years 3 male birds were<br>fitted with GPS transmitters, in 2010 one of theses birds with a 3-<br>D transmitter, which also transmits data on flight height, speed<br>and direction. The 2-D transmitters used in 2009 transmitted only<br>GPS fixes but no other data. A female was caught again after<br>three years and fitted with a new transmitter. A male was also<br>retrapped after two years but the transmitter was not replaced as<br>it was still in good working order.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong><br>Signal transmission lasted up to three years. With the exception<br>of the last fitted transmitter with GPS location data was<br>transmitted almost only during migration. Outside migration<br>periods the birds probably remained in vegetation that was too<br>dense to allow the transmitters to be adequately recharged.<br>Migration<br>We were able to record up to six complete autumn and spring<br>migration routes of individual birds. There is no previous<br>description in the relevant literature of pre-nuptial migration of<br>European Honey Buzzards fitted with satellite transmitters. For<br>two of the years both members of a pair could be studied. They<br>migrated separately and wintered far away from each other. All<br>birds migrated to West Africa.<br>The second longest migration route was taken by a male with<br>transmitter No. 57029 that flew 7,7612 km as far as Gabon (see<br>Fig. 6). It covered on average 167 km daily.
 With the exception<br>of male No. 52033 it is the only Honey Buzzard to date that has<br>crossed the Equator.<br>Data on flight height and speed became available for the first<br>time on autumn migration 2010 (for male No. 52033). It reached<br>its highest flight altitude over the Sahara at 1,703 m ASL at a<br>flight speed of 60 kph. The fastest flight speeds (72 und 76 kph)<br>were also recorded here. Speeds of between 60 and 70 kph<br>were recorded on seven occasions. The Honey Buzzard spent<br>the night of 10/11 September at a height of 1750 m ASL in the<br>Pyrenees.<br>Two birds perished on migration while crossing the Sahara and<br>Mediterranean respectively.</p>
<p>Wintering<br>In so far as the birds could be tracked as far as their wintering<br>area, four Honey Buzzards spent the winter in Nigeria and one<br>each in Gabon, Guinea, Cameroon, the Congo and Liberia.<br>Male No. 52033 wintered furthest south (2°22‘S/ 12°42‘) in<br>Congo (Brazzaville). Of the birds that were tracked more than<br>once as far as their winter quarters it was established that they<br>returned to the same areas. The home range size in the<br>wintering area was determined for the first time with the<br>assistance of GPS telemetry (see Fig. 2).<br>Behaviour in the breeding area<br>The main diet is the larva of ground-dwelling wasps. They build<br>their nests above all in woodland, but also in countryside border<br>structures (hedges, woodland fringes, waysides etc.), and to a<br>lesser extent in open areas. The GPS fixes were accurate<br>enough to enable the dug-out wasps’ nest to be found in some<br>cases.<br>The core area of
 foraging can change in the course of the<br>breeding season. Male No. 95770 for instance daily sought out<br>a piece of woodland 17 ha in size from 12 to 25 August 2009<br>but in the preceding period from 19 July to 11 August not at all.<br>We found three exploited wasps’ nests there.</p>
<p>The birds sometimes spent the night in their foraging areas in<br>close proximity to the wasps‘ nests found (Fig. 9), which had<br>probably not yet been completely exploited.<br>The home ranges of neighbouring pairs overlap to a great extent<br>and aerial territorial conflicts are common. They help patient<br>observers to determine the distribution of territories.</p></font></font></div></div>
