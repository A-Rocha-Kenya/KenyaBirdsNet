 why you didn't notice any wing-bars on it<BR>- and why there is no suggestion of this in the video grabs.

 the only fair-sized Phyllosc with silk-white underparts<BR>(as you say, some lack the yellow breast and throat),<BR>longish wings, green upperparts and prominent head-markings, all<BR>features, which are obvious in this bird. I cannot find any<BR>features contradicting a Wood Warbler id. Some strongly marked Willows<BR>can approach this bird with respect to some of the<BR>mentioned characters, but surely you would not find them all in one<BR>bird. Small Siberian Phylloscs (like Yellow-browed) can<BR>also appear similar, with prominent head patterns and whitish<BR>underparts, but they are very tiny and fast-moving.<BR>Maybe you had reached a conclusion already?<BR>Keep well,<BR>Dick<BR><BR><BR>Wed, Mar 31, 2010 at 11:33 AM<BR>Itai Shanni &lt;<A href="mailto:itaisha1@yahoo.com" ymailto="mailto:itaisha1@yahoo.com">itaisha1@yahoo.com</A>&gt; To: Brian Finch &lt;<A href="mailto:birdfinch@gmail.com"

But I have<BR>looked at rather a lot of willow warblers in the past. Firstly, I would<BR>say that on the basis of this single photo I'd be extremely wary of<BR>trying to identify the bird! I'll stick to the questions and a few<BR>general points.<BR>(1) I've seen (and handled) strikingly pure
 grey and white willow<BR>warblers on migration in Lebanon before - much paler and whiter than<BR>most of the birds wintering around here in Arusha. Always had long wings<BR>and I suspected them of being yakutensis race birds from a very long way<BR>east. These birds can have very pale tail feathers. (They also take a<BR>careful look to make sure they're not one of the occasional white wood<BR>warblers we also used to see.)<BR>(2) Some very fresh willow warblers (as they should be now) do show<BR>narrow white edges and tips to the remiges - but usually very narrow.<BR>I've never seen anything that conspicuously white-edged. But in the<BR>photo I'm not 100% convinced we're not just looking at the light right<BR>through a (uniformly) pale feather. Is it definitely not an artefact of<BR>the bright sky behind things?<BR>(3) Fresh adult willow warblers can definitely have nice rounded UTCs -<BR>I even spotted a few showing nicly on a google image search just
 now...<BR>So, in summary, I certainly won't hazard an identification from the<BR>photo, but certainly wouldn't rule out willow warbler. If there are any<BR>other pics of other parts of the bird from other angles I might have<BR>another try!<BR>That's my thought at least...<BR>C<BR>Nairobi phylloscopus<BR>Brian Finch Sat, Mar 27, 2010 at 10:27 PM<BR>Colin Beale &lt;<A href="mailto:cb751@york.ac.uk" ymailto="mailto:cb751@york.ac.uk">cb751@york.ac.uk</A>&gt; Mon, Mar 29, 2010 at 9:19 AM<BR>To: Brian Finch &lt;<A href="mailto:birdfinch@gmail.com" ymailto="mailto:birdfinch@gmail.com">birdfinch@gmail.com</A>&gt;<BR>Thanks for this! Definitely an interesting looking bird. The face<BR>pattern is pretty striking in some of those shots, and<BR>certainly the most interesting things about the bird that I can see.<BR>It's clearly not a yakutensis Willow with that colour<BR>showing through in some places, and the face pattern reminded me most<BR>of Arctic warbler
 rather than Wood - these always<BR>have a strong dark line under the supercilium like this one, but the<BR>the rest of the face is rather 'open' below that (bit like a<BR>Bonelli's), with fairly clear ear coverts and certainly no hint of a<BR>lower moustacial streak or anything like that, which is<BR>almost present in some of the shots. Rather, Arctic has the long back<BR>line, then scaly ear covert markings like those you<BR>see clearly in the last photo. That said, I doubt it is Arctic - the<BR>plumage is clearly very fresh and even though I can't<BR>remember the moult pattern in this species (I know that Greenish are<BR>unmoulted in spring and very tatty) assuming it does<BR>have a late winter moult you should have a nice white wing bar on a<BR>fresh wing which you'd certainly have seen. I'd also<BR>rule Wood warbler out on the basis of structure - as you note the tail<BR>is far too short. And it's clearly not a Chiff. Other African<BR>phylloscs that
 I can think of shouldn't be so white below and the same<BR>is true of the other Asian species I can think of. So<BR>my best guess is that it has to be a strange Willow, or perhaps a Wood<BR>with some Willow genes... It's certainly not typical<BR>for either, so given the balance of probability I'd expect a strange<BR>Willow over a strange Wood and the structure looks more<BR>like that. But I'd be interested to know what others think - have you<BR>sent it to any of the other bird groups in Europe? I'm sure<BR>you'd get a whole lot of ideas there...<BR>Best wishes,<BR>Colin<BR><BR>Nairobi phylloscopus Bernd de Bruijn &lt;<A href="mailto:bernddebruijn@hotmail.com" ymailto="mailto:bernddebruijn@hotmail.com">bernddebruijn@hotmail.com</A>&gt; Thu,<BR>Mar 25, 2010 at 10:57 PM<BR>To: Itai Shanni &lt;<A href="mailto:itaisha1@yahoo.com" ymailto="mailto:itaisha1@yahoo.com">itaisha1@yahoo.com</A>&gt;, <A href="mailto:birdfinch@gmail.com"
