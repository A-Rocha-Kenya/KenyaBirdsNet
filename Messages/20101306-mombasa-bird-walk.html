  <pre>Hi Marlene,

back when i was building the enclosures and watching over the owls, i had noticed once or twice when even after parenting the white faced scops owl to eat his meal rather than swallow, sometimes, he seemed more careless and swallowed his meal whole. this i noticed especially when his food portion was smaller than usual.

also with the verr. ea. owls, i had noticed that 2 individuals in particular used to swallow their meals.. but they seemed fine with digesting their meals and had a healthy appetite too..

Lazy habit i suppose?

PS: after i left there, i heard that the Spotted Eagle Owls successfully mated within their enclosure.. did the staff ever put out a nesting box for them to rear their chick in? did the chick survive? any idea on that?

Best Regards,

Karim Kara
