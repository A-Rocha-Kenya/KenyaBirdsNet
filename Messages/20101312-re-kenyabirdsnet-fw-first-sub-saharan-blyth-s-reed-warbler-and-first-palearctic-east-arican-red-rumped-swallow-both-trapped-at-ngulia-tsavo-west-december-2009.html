  <pre>Itai,
Please send the amendment for the PALEARCTIC RED_RUMPED SWALLOW

I think people will notice it is not the first East African Red-rumped
Swallow!!!!!

Thanks

&gt;
&gt; HI ITAI,
&gt; OBVIOUSLY NO-ONE FROM NGULIA IS INTERESTED IN SHARING THE INFO........ SO
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; FIRST SUB-SAHARAN BLYTH’S REED WARBLER AND FIRST EAST AFRICAN
&gt; RED-RUMPED SWALLOW, BOTH TRAPPED AT NGULIA, TSAVO WEST DECEMBER 2009.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Dear All,
&gt; The news has not been released by any of the members attached to the
&gt; Ngulia Ringing Group, and rather than wait any longer…. There was a
&gt; Blyth’s Reed Warbler caught at Ngulia on 19th December. This bird was
&gt; well examined (naturally) and relevant images taken. I believe it
&gt; represents the first sub-saharan record ever and is a very exciting
&gt; record, also of much interest at the same period they caught the first
&gt; ever palearctic Red-rumped Swallow recorded in East Africa. The bird
&gt; is very distinctive when compared to our local race, with a pale buff
&gt; face, and this individual had an almost whitish rump.
&gt; The two most exciting Kenyan migrants in 2009.
&gt; Best to all
&gt; Brian
