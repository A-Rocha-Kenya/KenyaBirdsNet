  <pre>Dear Joseph,

You are quite right that White-winged Widow is far more likely a
candidate based on locality.

Where do you stand on the other identifications?

&gt; Dear Adam, Dear Dieter,
&gt; Thanks you for your kind photos of Parasitic weavers. Coming back to your
&gt; comments, I would 100% denounce your Fan tailed widow???
&gt; Kindly see Dieter emials once again, his says all images taken in 21st July
&gt; 2010 Nairobi National Park. Have you ever seen a fan tailed in Nairobi ref;
&gt; your distribution of birds ?? this is a western Kenya species you are
&gt; talking off. Kindly allow me not to comment further as I had given my opnion
&gt; and will be happen to be corrected in a better way than this.
&gt;
&gt; To Adam, give me a call when you are in Nairobi and I can join you at the
&gt; park you challenge me there live as I believe, I was sure on myself.
&gt;
&gt; Good luck to all of us,as we try to sort out the images.
&gt;
&gt; Regards
&gt; Joseph

&gt; Hi Dieter, Joseph et al.,
&gt;
&gt; There are some interesting images here and I think that Joseph
&gt; certainly has some of the IDs correct. However, for my money, I&#39;d
&gt; suggest the following;
&gt;
&gt; 1. Fan-tailed Widow rather than White-winged, based on the lack of any
&gt; white on the greater coverts. The bird on the far left looks
&gt; especially good for this species.
&gt; 2. Parasitic Weaver (aka. Cuckoo Finch) - general jizz plus the head
&gt; shape and bill with flat-to-slightly concave culmen are indicative
&gt; 3. Red-billed Quelea on the left but others are different, and
&gt; probably Parasitic Weaver
&gt; 4.5. - Difficult to see but I&#39;d put money on Parasitic Weaver and not
&gt; Holub&#39;s which is a brighter and often bulkier bird.
&gt; 6. Again, looks like a worn Parasitic Weaver to me. Red-billed Quelea
&gt; would show a brighter red bill in most plumages, except immature when
&gt; it can be quite dull.
&gt; 7.8. - Red-collared Widow - moulting male
&gt; 9. I&#39;m not convinced these are Village Weavers. The bird on the right
&gt; shows a pale eye and blue legs, suggesting female Lesser Masked
&gt; Weaver. I would expect bill and body to look more robust if they were
&gt; Village Weavers.
&gt; 10. The same bird as the one on left in image 9 I guess? Dark eye
&gt; suggests an immature but this bird shows pinkish legs rather than
&gt; blue. The trickiest one for me!
&gt;
&gt; I have attached two images of Parasitic Weaver taken in the Mara in
&gt; June for you to compare with the birds in images 2,4,5,6. I hope this
&gt; helps.
&gt;
&gt; More feedback from the fundis required I think!
&gt;
&gt; Cheers and best,
&gt;

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Hello all,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m Dieter Van den Heuvel from Belgium. I am a birdwatcher that visited
&gt;&gt; Kenya for 16 days last month. We visited Kenya with a group of 6 birders
&gt;&gt; that had absolutely no experience with the Kenian birdlife, so I guess you
&gt;&gt; can imagine it was very difficult for us to identify some of the birds
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt; were in winter plumage. We took pictures of most of the birds we saw, but
&gt;&gt; for some we don&#39;t succeed in pointing out the species. That&#39;s why we are
&gt;&gt; looking for some ID-help. I hope I&#39;m not &#34;abusing&#34; this e-mail list and if
&gt;&gt; so please please let me know and ignore my e-mail. I was just hoping that
&gt;&gt; someone could help us with identifying the birds that are in the attached
&gt;&gt; images. All pictures were taken on July 21st in Nairobi NP.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; thanks in advance
&gt;&gt; Dieter
&gt;&gt;
