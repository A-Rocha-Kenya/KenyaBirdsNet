  <pre>Hi Dieter, Joseph et al.,

There are some interesting images here and I think that Joseph
certainly has some of the IDs correct. However, for my money, I&#39;d
suggest the following;

1. Fan-tailed Widow rather than White-winged, based on the lack of any
white on the greater coverts. The bird on the far left looks
especially good for this species.
2. Parasitic Weaver (aka. Cuckoo Finch) - general jizz plus the head
shape and bill with flat-to-slightly concave culmen are indicative
3. Red-billed Quelea on the left but others are different, and
probably Parasitic Weaver
4.5. - Difficult to see but I&#39;d put money on Parasitic Weaver and not
Holub&#39;s which is a brighter and often bulkier bird.
6. Again, looks like a worn Parasitic Weaver to me. Red-billed Quelea
would show a brighter red bill in most plumages, except immature when
it can be quite dull.
7.8. - Red-collared Widow - moulting male
9. I&#39;m not convinced these are Village Weavers. The bird on the right
shows a pale eye and blue legs, suggesting female Lesser Masked
Weaver. I would expect bill and body to look more robust if they were
Village Weavers.
10. The same bird as the one on left in image 9 I guess? Dark eye
suggests an immature but this bird shows pinkish legs rather than
blue. The trickiest one for me!

I have attached two images of Parasitic Weaver taken in the Mara in
June for you to compare with the birds in images 2,4,5,6. I hope this
helps.

More feedback from the fundis required I think!

Cheers and best,

Adam

&gt; Hello all,
&gt;
&gt; I&#39;m Dieter Van den Heuvel from Belgium. I am a birdwatcher that visited
&gt; Kenya for 16 days last month. We visited Kenya with a group of 6 birders
&gt; that had absolutely no experience with the Kenian birdlife, so I guess you
&gt; can imagine it was very difficult for us to identify some of the birds that
&gt; were in winter plumage. We took pictures of most of the birds we saw, but
&gt; for some we don&#39;t succeed in pointing out the species. That&#39;s why we are
&gt; looking for some ID-help. I hope I&#39;m not &#34;abusing&#34; this e-mail list and if
&gt; so please please let me know and ignore my e-mail. I was just hoping that
&gt; someone could help us with identifying the birds that are in the attached
&gt; images. All pictures were taken on July 21st in Nairobi NP.
&gt;
&gt; thanks in advance
&gt; Dieter
