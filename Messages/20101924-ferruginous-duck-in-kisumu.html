<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>We are currently touring in Western Kenya. After 5 wonderful days in Kakamega, we are now in Kisumu. This afternoon we explored the sewage ponds and spotted a big group of ducks. They were approximatively 300 individuals. I decided to scan the group with my digiscope. White-faced Whistiling Duck were the most abundant species&nbsp;with some 25 Fulvous Whistling Ducks. In the middle of the group, I remarked a smaller and darker Duck. And I was really surprised to identify a Ferruginous Duck. Does anyone know if it was an earlier report from Kisumu?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The full report will be send after the tour.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I also take this opportunity to wish everybody a Merry Christmas and a happy New Year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Best for now,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Patrick</DIV></div><br>
