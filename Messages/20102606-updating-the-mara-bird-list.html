  <pre>Hi All,

Having received a copy of Brian Finch&#39;s first edition of the Masai
Mara checklist, I&#39;m still left with a few doubts about a few species
on my working Mara list as we cannot seem to find a copy of the latest
(4th) edition anywhere. Can anyone tell me if there are any confirmed
records of the following species in the Mara and it&#39;s neighbouring
conservancies?

African Pygmy Goose
Cape Teal
Southern Pochard
Lesser Flamingo
Great Cormorant
Saker Falcon
Greater Spotted Eagle
Buff-crested Bustard
Stone Curlew
Lesser Jacana
Black-tailed Godwit
Whiskered Tern (surely ...?)
Chestnut-bellied Sandgrouse
Lovebird sp., (including hybrids)
Cape (Mackinder&#39;s) Eagle Owl
Freckled Nightjar
Brown-backed Woodpecker
Black-fronted Bushshrike
Woodchat Shrike
Cape Rook
Singing Bush Lark
Chestnut-backed Sparrow Lark
Wailing Cisticola
Common Chiffchaff
Barred Warbler
Northern Pied Babbler
Golden-backed Weaver
Chestnut Weaver
Red-headed Quelea
Yellow-crowned Bishop
Blue-capped Cordon-bleu
Eastern Paradise Whydah
Steel-blue Whydah

Many thanks indeed,
