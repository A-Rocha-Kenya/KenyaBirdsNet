  Hi All,<br><br>It&#39;s been a very busy season at Naibor so my bird reporting has had to take a back seat for a few months (sorry!) but here&#39;s a few highlights from the Mara over the past few weeks.<br><br>Pick of the migrants has to be a dark morph Eleanora&#39;s Falcon seen dashing over Rhino Ridge yesterday evening (26th) - quite unexpected so early in the season but it&#39;s large size and dark underwings helped with the necessary rapid ID, as it wasn&#39;t hanging around. Otherwise, two Caspian Plover just outside camp on 14th September were good records but where are the flocks of 100s? European Bee-eaters have been steadily coming through in small numbers (no big flocks) since 2nd Sept and I recorded my first House Martin near Lookout Hill yesterday, 26th. Rufous-chested Swallows have been gathering in good numbers (with flocks of 30+) and also I encountered several small groups (up to 8) of Grey-rumped Swallow and Banded Martin (35+) this week, plus hundreds of Barn Swallows passing south over the plains. On 24th, a pair of Long-toed Plovers were seen at Musiara but there were few migrant waders there, just one Ruff and a Common Greenshank. We&#39;ve had many Wood, Green and Common Sandpipers along the Talek River by camp since early August and a single Little Stint for several days there around 3rd September. Nine White Storks were seen close to Somak on 20th and a male Klaas&#39;s Cuckoo has been seen several times in camp since mid-August.<br>
<br>An interesting breeding record is that of a pair of Woolly-necked Storks which have raised four young on a bend in the Mara river just a few km&#39;s north of the Sand River gate in the south of the park.<br><br>No migrants warblers, shrikes or wheatears here yet but it can&#39;t be long now ...<br>
<br>Happy Birding,<br><br>Adam<br>Naibor Camp, Masai Mara <br><br>ps - we are now hand-feeding a Slate-coloured Boubou (Betty Boubou!!!) in the office as it&#39;s taken quite a liking to our morning biscuits!<br>
