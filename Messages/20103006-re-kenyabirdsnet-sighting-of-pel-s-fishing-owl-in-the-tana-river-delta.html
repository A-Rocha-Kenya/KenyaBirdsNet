<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Regarding about Pel's Fishing Owl seen in Tana Delta or Coast. There are reports about the species seen in Tana Delta, Mara River and Nairobi N.P. The one from Nairobi N.P was seen by Brian finch. Check the IBA's of Kenya.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Regards,</DIV>

<DIV>Hello all, </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I have recently joined the mail group and have not had time since my travels in April to post a very exciting sighting...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>On April 6th, my husband and I took a boat 2 hours up the Tana River from the mouth.&nbsp; We veered to the right ( around 830 am) and went around a small island.&nbsp; Immediately on leaving the main river, we saw a huge bird fly across the top of the trees and perch at the top of a tree to our left.&nbsp; Amazingly, it was a Pel's Fishing Owl.&nbsp; He remained on the branch in full view for about 3 or 4 minutes and even turned with his back to us and rotated his head around to peer at us.&nbsp;&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>In my book, I do not have the Pel's Fishing Owl's distribution&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Tana Delta.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Have others seen a Pel's Fishing Owl in the Tana Delta or on the coast? </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Thanks for any comments or feedback, </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
