&gt; Hello Birders,
&gt;
&gt; On Wednesday birdwalk, we went to splash. We saw a good number of migrants
&gt; like Willow Warbler, Common Rock Thrush, Common Cuckoo, Spotted Flycatcher,
&gt; Northern Wheatear, Common Buzzard andÂ Booted Eagle.
&gt;
&gt; What we saw not sure a Thrush Nightingale or Nightingale. This species had a
&gt; rufous tail until the rump and cock it&#39;s tail. Please have a look at the
&gt; photo which is attached. Some of the other birders had also taken pictures
&gt; of this species.
