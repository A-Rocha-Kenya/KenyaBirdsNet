  <pre>Recently I did a search on various wildlife tracking techniques. 
At the moment a wide, and rapidly expanding, range of tracking devices are available. From state-of-the-art VHF GPS SATELLITE collars on elephants to little VHF TRANSMITTER BACKPACKS on bats and birds and everything in between: VHF, UHF, GPS store on board, remotely downloadable options, ARGOS, GPS ARGOS, NORTHSTAR, automatic drop-off, remotely controlled drop-off, collars working with the mobile network and many more options. 
Because the performance of tracking devices on different species and in differen regions (climate, satellite coverage) vary a lot, and many companies don&#39;t have a wide experience with their type of collar on the animal you want to track in the region on earth you want to track it, it&#39;s difficult to find out which collar suits your research best.

So I started looking for news groups about collar but I found none. 
I now started a group: http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/group/WildlifeTracking

This group is intended to share experiences on the wide range of available tracking devices. And to provide answers/advice on the choice of collars.

Regards,

Egil
