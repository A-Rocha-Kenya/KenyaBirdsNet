  <hr/>
  <pre>Western Marsh-Harrier Circus aeruginosus
Western used here instead of Eurasian as the eastern birds have now
been separated from aeruginosus.

Moustached Tinkerbird Pogoniulus leucomystax
Green has been dropped as obsolete in the name as with current usage
and the new Checklist, instead of Moustached Green Tinkerbird.

Usambiro Barbet Trachyphonus usambiro
This south-western Kenyan and central northern Tanzanian endemic form
has in the past been treated as a form of d&#39;Arnaud&#39;s Barbet by people
unfamiliar as to how different it is. In the Kenya field-guides it
rightly has a specific identity, but in the latest Checklist it was
relegated to a race of d&#39;Arnaud&#39;s once more.

Nairobi Pipit Anthus nov sp (kisembensis)
Although still o officially written-up, this distinctive form is
familiar to Nairobi residents where it is resident in Nairobi National
Park sharing the area with the similar Long-billed Pipit. One was
singing on a territory and photographed by the Lhoirs. It was a
Nairobi Pipit rather than a Long-billed Pipit, and extends the range
west of the Rift. As the form has still not been published, rightly
the Field-Guides and the new Checklist do not list the bird.

Dark-capped Bulbul Pycnonotus [barbatus] tricolor
This is the bird listed as Common Bulbul in the Field-Guides, which is
usually reserved for the nominate barbatus not found in our region.

Black-capped Mountain-Greenbul Andropadus nigriceps
This form was not expected though nigriceps is mentioned in Britton as
occurring in the Loitas. Recent authors have separated the
geographical forms under Mountain Greenbul into separate species. The
widespread Kenyan bird tephrolaemus is Grey-headed Mountain Greenbul,
the bird is the Loitas is strangely the nominate form nigriceps. This
form is confined to Loita south to Ngorongoro Forests as is known as
Black-capped Mountain Greenbul. If the taxonomy is accepted, whilst
this is previously known from the Loitas it was sunk in with
tephrolaemus, under the latest treatment this will be an addition to
the Kenyan list.

Lynes&#39;s Cisticola Cisticola [lais] distinctus
This form had a specific identity separate from the southern Wailing
Cisticola, which we do not have in Kenya.

Little Rush Warbler Bradypterus baboecala elgonensis
The form in the Loitas was elgonensis, that is found over the
remainder of west of the Rift, east to Athi. The very deep voiced,
reed inhabiting southern form baboecala, most certainly specifically
distinct is found from Simba south to Amboseli, east to Lake Jipe and
the coast.

Buff-bellied Penduline-Tit Anthoscopus sylviella sylviella
Treated as a distinct species in various world checklists, it is not
given specific identity in the Field-Guides or the new Checklist. The
Buff-bellied which really has as chestnut underparts as a Red-faced
Crombec, is restricted to SW Kenya over the border into Tanzania.

Swahili Sparrow  Passer suahelicus
This form has variously been treated as a race of Grey-headed Sparrow
Passer griseus, or as its own species. The Field-Guides separate it,
but the recent Checklist has sunk it back into Grey-headed Sparrow.

Southern Citril  Serinus hypostictus
The African Citril group is a complex affair to sort out. In the
Field-Guides there is only one species treated, but the new Checklist
recognises the splitting into African S. citrinelloides  and Southern
Citril S. hypostictus.  The simple division is into black-faced and
grey-faced males. Southern incorporates two forms, hypostictus found
in the mountains of the Chyulus and Loita, and brittoni of Kakamega
towards the Ugandan border. Comparison of videos of these two forms
show little resemblance to each other, other than the differing
distributions of grey on the face.

MAMMALS RECORDED

African Grass Rat sp Arvicanthis sp
A couple of colonies seen

Slender Mongoose Herpestes sanguinea
Only one individual near the Camp.

Spotted Hyena Crocuta crocuta
Heard calling at the Camp, where old dung seen.

Greater Galago sp Otolemur sp

Nairobi, but also like argentatus Â¬of the Mara.

One individual near the Camp.

Bushbuck Tragelaphus scriptus
Frequently met with in forest and clearings.

Burchell&#39;s Zebra Equus burchellii
Mysteriously two in forest near the Camp were the only individuals recorded.

Anyone with details of the Bookings and costings, might like to write
something to promote Enkang Sapuk, and post the details to the net, so
the Loita experience can be shared.

Best to all
Brian
