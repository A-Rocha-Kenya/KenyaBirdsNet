  <P>Dear Adam,&nbsp;Dear Dieter,<BR>Thanks you for your kind photos of 
  Parasitic weavers. Coming back to your&nbsp;comments, I would 100% denounce 
  your Fan tailed widow???<BR>Kindly see Dieter&nbsp;emials once again, his says 
  all images taken in 21st July 2010 Nairobi National Park. Have you&nbsp;ever 
  seen a fan tailed in Nairobi ref; your distribution of birds ?? this is a 
  western Kenya species you are talking off. Kindly allow me not to comment 
  further as I had given my opnion and will be happen to be corrected in a 
  better way than this.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>To Adam, give me a call when you are in 
  Nairobi and I can join you at the park you challenge me there live as I 
  believe, I was sure on myself.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Good luck to all of us,as we try 
  to sort out the images.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Regards<BR>Joseph<BR>&nbsp;<BR>

  <DIV id=ecxygrp-text>Hi Dieter, Joseph et al.,<BR><BR>There are some 
  interesting images here and I think that Joseph<BR>certainly has some of the 
  IDs correct. However, for my money, I'd<BR>suggest the following;<BR><BR>1. 
  Fan-tailed Widow rather than White-winged, based on the lack of any<BR>white 
  on the greater coverts. The bird on the far left looks<BR>especially good for 
  this species.<BR>2. Parasitic Weaver (aka. Cuckoo Finch) - general jizz plus 
  the head<BR>shape and bill with flat-to-slightly concave culmen are 
  indicative<BR>3. Red-billed Quelea on the left but others are different, 
  and<BR>probably Parasitic Weaver<BR>4.5. - Difficult to see but I'd put money 
  on Parasitic Weaver and not<BR>Holub's which is a brighter and often bulkier 
  bird.<BR>6. Again, looks like a worn Parasitic Weaver to me. Red-billed 
  Quelea<BR>would show a brighter red bill in most plumages, except immature 
  when<BR>it can be quite dull.<BR>7.8. - Red-collared Widow - moulting 
  male<BR>9. I'm not convinced these are Villa ge Weavers. The bird on the 
  right<BR>shows a pale eye and blue legs, suggesting female Lesser 
  Masked<BR>Weaver. I would expect bill and body to look more robust if they 
  were<BR>Village Weavers.<BR>10. The same bird as the one on left in image 9 I 
  guess? Dark eye<BR>suggests an immature but this bird shows pinkish legs 
  rather than<BR>blue. The trickiest one for me!<BR><BR>I have attached two 
  images of Parasitic Weaver taken in the Mara in<BR>June for you to compare 
  with the birds in images 2,4,5,6. I hope this<BR>helps.<BR><BR>More feedback 
  from the fundis required I think!<BR><BR>Cheers and 
  best,<BR><BR>Adam<BR>Naibor Camp, Masai Mara<BR><BR>On 24/08/2010, AYUB

  t;<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; Hello all,<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; I'm Dieter Van den 
  Heuvel from Belgium. I am a birdwatcher that visited<BR>&gt; Kenya for 16 days 
  last month. We visited Kenya with a group of 6 birders<BR>&gt; that had 
  absolutely no experience with the Kenian birdlife, so I guess you<BR>&gt; can 
  imagine it was very difficult for us to identify some of the birds 
  that<BR>&gt; were in winter plumage. We took pictures of most of the birds we 
  saw, but<BR>&gt; for some we don't succeed in pointing out the species. That's 
  why we are<BR>&gt; looking for some ID-help. I hope I'm not "abusing" this 
  e-mail list and if<BR>&gt; so please please let me know and ignore my e-mail. 
  I was just hoping that<BR>&gt; someone could help us with identifying the 
  birds that are in the attached<BR>&gt; images. All pictures were taken on July 
  21st in Nairobi NP.<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; thanks in advance<BR>&gt; 
  Dieter<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt;<BR><BR></DIV>
