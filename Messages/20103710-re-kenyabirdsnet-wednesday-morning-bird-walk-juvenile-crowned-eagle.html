<FONT FACE="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><SPAN STYLE='font-size:14pt'>Dear George and Peter<BR>
<BR>
Your photos of an immature eagle on the Wednesday Morning Birdwalk are superb, thank you for sharing them with us.<BR>
<BR>
I think the bird is an immature Ayres&#8217; Hawk Eagle. Both Ayres&#8217; Hawk Eagle and Crowned Eagle are found in Ngong Road Forest Sanctuary. <BR>
<BR>
Immature Crowned Eagles should show a slight crest and spots on the feathered legs.<BR>
<BR>
My group saw something much smaller &#8211; a Little Sparrowhawk!<BR>
<BR>
Wishing you good birding, Fleur<BR>

This Wednesday's morning bird walk led us to Ngong Race Course where one &nbsp;group explored the region around the dams next to the entrance. In this &nbsp;region we repeatedly saw a huge bird of prey, probably a juvenile crowned eagle. I am not going to describe this bird in layman's words, just have a look.<BR>
If you are interested, I can provide better resolution on request (and to a robust mail box only).<BR>
For identification this should be fine.<BR>
<BR>
Happy Birding,<BR>
Georg<BR>
