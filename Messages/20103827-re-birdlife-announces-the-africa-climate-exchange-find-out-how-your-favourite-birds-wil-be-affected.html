<DIV>Dear Neil, Colin, Peter and all,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>this is a very hot topic in many peer review publications that deals with bird migration, conservation, climate and general ecology.<BR>i have attached the 3 papers below just as examples.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>i agree completely with Peter saying that habitat loss is the most important factor that we all need to deal with as conservationists and that probably the major change in bird migration routes and stopover sites is connected to the sites that they find (or not) or their way, while the climate change, though affecting the habitat, is not strongly correlated to change in route but may be linked to changing of wintering sites(i.e. shifting wintering sites further north).</DIV>

<DIV><SPAN style="COLOR: #1f497d; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Dear all,</SPAN></DIV>
<DIV id=ygrp-mlmsg>

<DIV class=Section1>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="COLOR: #1f497d; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">I have not read the offending document and normally would not comment on issues relating to the range and migration of birds of which I know little. I wonder at the need of some species to migrate and whether &nbsp;the deep seated compulsion to depart from winter climes can be ever influenced by climate change. &nbsp;While, perhaps, it is easier to understand why birds flee an approaching winter it bewilders me that they choose to go back when food remains plentiful and climate &nbsp;benign. Why embark on a hazardous and potentially unrewarding journey? It seems to me that irrespective of the progression of climate change the birds are so immutably programmed to compass and clock, they will fly irrespective of altered or changing circumstances or degree of risk. </SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="COLOR: #1f497d; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">However, my musings are not the reason for my intervention. As a climatologist with 40 years experience of African weather with half of that time spent as the chief atmospheric scientist responsible for addressing climate change impacts under the World Climate Programme, I can say that while it is probable that climate is changing as a consequence of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, there is limited understanding of the likely speed of global warming or of the level it might reach globally irrespective of mitigation policies. Furthermore, the nature and extent of regional or national climate change, especially in the tropics are not understood at all beyond imperfect model projections based on limited, incomplete and imperfect data sets. It is not possible at present to identify with any certainty, a climate change signal in Africa. The African climate is highly variable and it is
 this extreme variability often influenced by large scale ocean-atmosphere interactions that are currently more significant than the projected anthropogenic climate change. In my opinion, it is not possible to make believable projections of altered ranges or movement of bird species based on imperfect predictions of regional climate change. Destruction &nbsp;of habitat and other effects of human population increases are having, and will have a profound negative effect on nature including wildlife and birds. Climate change, in comparison, has currently little impact and even when it changes sufficiently to be a factor in bird behavior, I am afraid people will still wield the greater influence. Environmental groups in Kenya are fighting a battle to protect the Tana River delta. It is an important staging area for migrating birds, It is home to important and rare flora and fauna. Pastoralists use the abundant grazing and water as a refuge against regional
 drought, It has the potential to become a valuable income-generating eco-tourism site. Yet it is threatened by many local and multi-national developers who would clear the forests and convert the pastures to large-scale rice and sugar cultivation for export, Others wish to mine it for its minerals and a foreign government seeks the land to grow food for its country in exchange for engineering development . Nature there will be destroyed for ever. Avian migratory routes &nbsp;and habitat ranges will be forced to change but it will not be a consequence of climate.</SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Colin is not a member of these groups so this msg will not have reached you.</SPAN></P></DIV>
<DIV>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">I've asked him for a pdf of his paper mentioned below and will circulate it.</SPAN></P></DIV>
<DIV>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">While Climate Change is "real" it's effect on Africa's birdlife is currently insignificant compared to the effect of this&nbsp;rapid human population growth. Many of the range shifts and local&nbsp;extirpations we are witnessing can be laid at the door of habitat degradation.&nbsp;A warmer climate will exaggerate&nbsp;the desiccation of marginal habitats but habitat change due to over exploitation&nbsp;should be&nbsp;far more of a concern to all of us living today. There really are people in Europe who are looking at suggesting changing the borders of our protected areas to accommodate range shifts "in the future"...if only wild Africa had a future...... .......</SPAN></P></DIV>
<DIV>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Using a flawed data set (esp when more accurate data exists) and applying questionable models will do nothing to enhance bird conservation in Africa.</SPAN></P></DIV>
<DIV>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">We must look to habitat protection&nbsp;and wise use&nbsp;with long term improvements in local agriculture (permaculture is the key word here) NOT huge mechanised farms growing food and biofuel for Middle Eastern and Far Eastern countries or bottom line accounting for Western European timber companies. The long term, indeed the only, solution to Africa's problems lies with an EDUCATED population who will control it's own growth,&nbsp;prosperity and eventually it's own destiny.</SPAN></P>
