In the<BR>mean-time here is the most interesting observation. This is identical<BR>to how it has been submitted to the East African Rarities Committee.<BR>Best Birding<BR>Brian<BR><BR><BR><BR>BLACK-BILLED WOOD DOVE Turtur abyssinicus<BR>IN THE
 KERIO VALLEY KENYA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Brian W Finch<BR><BR>On 28th November 1995, I was birdwatching with a group of Americans in<BR>the Kerio Valley, a kilometre on the Kabarnet side of the Kapluk Road<BR>Junction (itself just south along the Kerio River).<BR><BR>The vegetation was lightly bushed with Croton and similar shrubs, very<BR>scattered Acacias, and large open areas of barren stoney ground<BR>without cover apart from scant herbs and Vinca rosea.<BR><BR>We flushed a small dove from the base of a bush, which flew back past<BR>us and settled on a horizontal branch three metres above the ground in<BR>an Acacia.<BR><BR>I naturally assumed the bird to be an Emerald-spotted Wood Dove Turtur<BR>chalcospila, but was very surprised on looking at the bird, to find<BR>not green but deep blue spots on
 the coverts. I then announced that<BR>the bird was not an Emerald-spotted but a Blue-spotted Wood Dove. On<BR>the second glance I noticed that the bill was all black although the<BR>bird was clearly adult, the crown and forehead were silvery-grey, not<BR>soft lavender, and the back was cold grey not the pale brownish grey<BR>of afer. The underparts were also pale grey, not warm buff. With this<BR>combination of features I realised that I was studying a Black-billed<BR>Wood Dove, not a Blue-spotted Wood Dove, and advised the group<BR>accordingly.<BR><BR>The bird perched for several minutes, only seven metres distant, and<BR>appeared quite unconcerned, but when it flew off it flew far down the<BR>valley. However excellent views were obtained, and the following<BR>description taken.<BR><BR>Size and shape, just like T. chalcospila and afer. Head grey, with<BR>silvery-grey forehead and crown. Eye blackish, a narrow black line<BR>from eye to base of the all
 black bill. Wings cold grey, wing coverts<BR>with four deep blue spots, the upper two offset to the leading edge to<BR>the wing, the four spots forming the points of a rough diamond<BR>configuration. Flight feathers rich rust in flight. Back cold grey<BR>without any tinge of brown or other warm colouration, and two blackish<BR>bars across the rump typical of the genus. Underparts cold grey,<BR>without the warm buff shades found in afer.<BR><BR>I saw the species again nearby the following year 1996 and again in<BR>1999, in the same general&nbsp; area, again with multiple observers. With<BR>such a claim it was difficult to prove the species as far as a new<BR>bird for Kenya was concerned without some more evidence, as there<BR>would always be people saying quite rightly, basing the observation on<BR>an iridescence is a difficult point, with blue merging with greens<BR>depending on the angle of light striking the feathers. So I did make<BR>it known that I
 thought that there was the possibility of small<BR>population of Black-billed Wood Dove in the bottom of the Kerio<BR>Valley. Even a month ago whilst here with some other Kenyan birding<BR>residents, we were keeping a wary eye and chasing wood-doves, but only<BR>finding Emerald-spotted.<BR><BR>On 23rd February 2010, I was leading a group of overseas birders and<BR>we were having our lunch in the middle of the day, in the forest patch<BR>down the quarry road to the right immediately before crossing the<BR>Kerio River from Kabarnet.<BR>There were a couple of wood-doves feeding along the edge of some dense<BR>scrub, and a client said the wing-spots were blue. On hearing this I<BR>asked what colour was the bill, black they replied. My interest was<BR>now more on the bird than the sandwich, and I went to see them. They<BR>flew, but no great distance, and we were fortunate in relocating them.<BR>Typical of the genus, they were wary but we had good views as
 they<BR>waddled around in circles whilst feeding. As they moved they reflected<BR>light from all directions, there was no doubt that the wing spots were<BR>blue without any hint of green, and equally that the bill was all<BR>black. I managed to get a few rather poor images as it was quite<BR>strongly dappled light, and the birds distant. These images show the<BR>features of the blue-spots and the all black bill and I am now ready<BR>to submit the record as Black-billed Wood Dove for Kenya.<BR>There were Emerald-spotted Wood Doves in the same area, and these were<BR>typical of the species. The pattern and colour of the birds suggested<BR>that both of the pair were adults, and having had Blue-spotted<BR>Wood-Doves in my Mara garden for nine years (together with<BR>Emerald-spotted) I frequently saw immature birds and these too showed<BR>red on the bills before the adult pattern was attained.<BR>The two birds were identical, and as follows;<BR>Overall
 appearance pallid, with the pale greyish upperparts<BR>contrasting little with the greyish-white belly. Head conspicuously<BR>hooded, pale blue-grey on rear half, but white from top of forehead to<BR>base of bill and even whiter on the throat. Wing spots large and<BR>iridescent deepish blue from every angle. Bill all black from base to<BR>tip. Structurally identical to other members of the genus.<BR><BR>I believe that there is an overlooked resident population of<BR>Black-billed Wood-Dove in the Kerio Valley, having had sightings<BR>spanning fourteen years. It would be surprising if the population is<BR>only confined here, and does not extend northwards along the base of<BR>the western wall of the Rift Valley where habitat is similar.<BR></DIV></DIV></DIV></div></body></html>
