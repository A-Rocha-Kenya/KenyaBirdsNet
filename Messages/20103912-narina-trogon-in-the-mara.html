Hi All,<br>
<br>
Despite several failed attempts to see this bird in the Mara this season,<br>
Vicki and I finally clocked it at Serenget Campsite on 9th October (just 5<br>
minutes drive from Naibor Camp).<br>
<br>
What a jaw-droppingly beautiful bird it is!<br>
<br>
A few more migrants around lately including a male Pallid Harrier on Oct 10th, several Hobby over, a sprinkling of<br>
Willow Warbler in camp and many Northern Wheatear passing through this week.<br>
<br>
Happy Birding!<br>
<br>
