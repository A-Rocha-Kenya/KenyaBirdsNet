<DIV>Dear All,<BR>You will remember the posting 25th January 2010, regarding the<BR>confusion reigning in the status and distribution of Black-cheeked and<BR>Black-faced Waxbills in Kenya…..<BR>Today 16th May, Nigel Hunter came around at 6.30am and we set off for<BR>the Magadi Road.&nbsp; The aim of this excursion was to test the claims of<BR>sympatry for Black-faced Estrilda erythronotus and Black-cheeked<BR>Waxbill Estrilda charmosyna .&nbsp; The claims of these two birds living<BR>together had always struck me as rather strange.<BR>It was a nice morning and we stopped at a few spots and listened, but<BR>no sign of the waxbills. Finally we arrived at the Camel Road shortly<BR>before the descent to Ol Tepesi we stopped for breakfast coffee.<BR>Whilst pouring, a Black-cheeked or faced Waxbill called, and leaving<BR>the cups half-full we abandoned breakfast to look for it. We walked<BR>along the badly charcoaled creek, checking the remaining trees
 and<BR>came back on the other bank towards the car. I spotted a juvenile<BR>Steel-blue Whydah. It’s a very distinctive plumage, probably making it<BR>the easiest of small non-adult male whydahs to identify,&nbsp; and yet it<BR>has never been illustrated in any field guide, or any adequate<BR>description given in text. The bird is all grey-brown with a very<BR>conspicuous black face, mimicking its hosts the Black-cheeked and<BR>Black-faced Waxbills. I thought it might be worth staying with this<BR>bird which was positioned right near the car, and we soon also spotted<BR>two female Steel-blues “hanging” around the same area.<BR>Soon a waxbill came in to join these birds, and it had a completely<BR>white throat. We were elated believing the bird to be of the race<BR>kiwanukae. Then another bird flew in with what initially looked like<BR>food. This bird disappeared into the centre of a Cordia ovalis<BR>(Sandpaper Tree), where the three Steel-blues
 were also tucked away.<BR>Wonderful we thought a pair of Black-cheeked Waxbill feeding<BR>Steel-blue Whydah adoptees. Then the waxbill emerged from the Cordia,<BR>and revealed itself as a male Black-faced Waxbill&nbsp; erythronotus! All<BR>black throat, bright red flanks and solid black vent., this bird<BR>looked identical to the race delamerei from Nairobi NP. Both birds<BR>flew off, but the Steel-blues stayed and had aerial chases around the<BR>tree. It seemed a safe bet that they would return and so we stayed<BR>with the whydahs. After a while a delamerei-like bird came back with a<BR>great wad of nesting material and disappeared into the Cordia, and the<BR>huge nest some two feet long was immediately apparent. Another male<BR>plumaged Black-faced came into the Cordia, but was chased off by the<BR>first male. A male Black-faced came back and gathered more nest<BR>material from near the nesting tree, and entered the nest. Then to our<BR>amazement, the
 Black-cheeked flew in and also entered the nest. These<BR>birds were a nesting pair!!!<BR>An adult male Steel-blue Whydah flew overhead chasing a female, and<BR>landed in some thornscrub not too far away. Stills and videos were<BR>taken of the entire assemblage, including black-throated,<BR>black-undertail presumed male, and white-throated uniform pale<BR>undertail and entire underparts lacking crimson on the flanks. The<BR>birds were vocal around the nest, both sounding the same.<BR><BR>So in trying to solve the mystery of sympatry in these two forms we<BR>have come up with so many more unanswered questions, though admittedly<BR>from a sample of one.<BR><BR>Are the claims of Estrilda charmosyna&nbsp; along the Magadi Road merely a<BR>female plumage of Estrilda erythronotus.&nbsp; I would suggest that this is<BR>the case here, and only erythronotus is found on Magadi Road.<BR><BR>If this is the case it explains the other claims of sympatry in
 Tsavo,<BR>but we need people to be on the look-out for mixed pairs in this area<BR>(or better still details of both birds at the nest).<BR><BR>If it were merely a sexual difference in plumage, why then do birds<BR>north (Nairobi) and south (along the Tanzanian border) only show<BR>black-throats in both sexes?<BR><BR>Is the race on Magadi Road the same as that of Tsavo and is this kiwanukae?<BR><BR>Is the race delamerei sourrounding kiwanukae on three sides, Nairobi,<BR>Maasai Mara and the Tanzanian border area?<BR><BR>Is it that kiwanukae genuinely absent from Tanzania, is the reason<BR>that no white-throated forms have ever been found in that country. But<BR>what happens over the border from Tsavo region?<BR><BR>Now what is going on with the Steel-blue Whydahs?<BR><BR>The black-faced immature I have always thought as a male plumage, but<BR>can it occur in both sexes. It would make sense that both sexes when<BR>with young erythronotus/charmosyna have
 black faces and blend in.<BR><BR>In an immature plumage the young bird is unlikely to have mated either<BR>as a male or female, and yet it was staying in the same area as the<BR>waxbills and the two female-plumaged Steel-blues.<BR><BR>Before the nest was discovered, or the birds were seen carrying<BR>nesting material, one waxbill entered a bush with what looked like a<BR>food item whilst the black-faced Steel-blue was inside the bush, and<BR>the waxbill was thought to be feeding the young bird, although no such<BR>transfer was seen. Was this then still a dependent of the waxbills,<BR>even though it appeared very agile and perfectly capable of finding<BR>its own food. It made no effort at independent feeding and just sat<BR>around the edge of the bushes, waiting.<BR><BR>Do the progeny of brood parasitism remain with the foster-parents long<BR>after the genuine nestlings have departed up to the point of the<BR>planning of the next brood?<BR><BR>The adult
 male Steel-blue showed no interest at all in the nesting<BR>waxbills, or the female Steel-blues that were stationed near the nest.<BR>Even though he was actively displaying and chasing females nearby.<BR>Does this infer that the two females were mated birds waiting for the<BR>waxbills to lay before inserting their own eggs into the nest.<BR><BR>Is there a record of multiple brood parasites attendant on one nest?<BR><BR>Having now seen suggestive evidence that kiwanukae belongs with<BR>erythronotus and not charmosyna as previously thought, I still feel<BR>that charmosyna/pallidior are not conspecific with erythronotus,&nbsp; in<BR>having a more sibilant call, slender structure and more dramatic<BR>plumage differences. The structural, vocal and plumage similarities of<BR>kiwanukae to erythronotus rather than&nbsp; charmosyna are then better<BR>explained by changing the affinities.<BR><BR>Attached images: Top left to right&nbsp; Male at nest, female at

It is common around Nairobi all down to the Tanzanian<BR>border (?), and likewise the distribution extends over the southern<BR>border into the Maasai Mara and Tsavo (?).<BR>Originally the two birds were treated as races of the same species,<BR>although they were separated a long time ago now, but is it possible<BR>that the complex includes a third species!?<BR>I have attached photographs of
 charmosyna from Kongelai in NW Kenya,<BR>Haberswein in NE Kenya, and Samburu in E Kenya. The most marked thing<BR>about these birds when encountered is that they are so pale by<BR>comparison with erythronotus, and lack red on belly and flanks,<BR>although there is a pink tinge. So that when the birds are illustrated<BR>from south of the equator towards the Tanzanian border areas of Tsavo<BR>and Magadi Road, they are illustrated with the same dark plumage as<BR>erythronotus. It is this that had led me (up to now) to think that<BR>these records of charmosyna in southern Kenya have been mis-identified<BR>or seen badly. As the colouration of the eastern/northern charmosyna<BR>is so very different.<BR>Having just visited Tsavo this past weekend, we located some waxbills<BR>at Sagala Lodge and took photographs of the birds that were inhabiting<BR>the Commiphora/Delonix/Acacia woodland. We were struggling to see a<BR>black throat, on what looked superficially
 like erythronotus, and try<BR>as we might, whilst the birds had a thin black line across the throat<BR>at the base of the bill, the throat was pale. The birds were fairly<BR>common (especially at owl-mobs), and once captivated by the presence<BR>of an owlet remained confined to a small area and were easier to<BR>study. As far as I know charmosyna is not recorded for Tanzania, but<BR>this form must be found in the contiguous habitat that crosses the<BR>border. (?)<BR>I have attached an image of the typical erythronotus from Nairobi. The<BR>black throat is very extensive and obvious, this is bordered by a<BR>narrow whitish band that borders the lower part of the face patch and<BR>continues across the throat. Overall the bird is dark toned, the<BR>underparts reddish tinged grey across the belly and upper chest, a<BR>deeper red band across the lower breast, striking red flanks, and<BR>blackish lower belly to crissum.<BR>A comparison of the photograph
 charmosyna (?) attached, that comes<BR>from Sagala Lodge last Saturday, leads to many differences. The face<BR>is black, but the throat is greyish, the birds share the white border<BR>to the black face but this is restricted to the lower edge of the<BR>face, but is absent on the black edge that borders the throat. The<BR>underparts lack red, mainly buffy-grey on the upper chest, shading to<BR>no striking red-flanks. Above the two birds are very similar.<BR>Checking the illustrations in Stevenson and Fanshawe, it became very<BR>evident, that the erythronotus painting is incredibly awful, and not<BR>looking anything like a Kenyan member of the species. The extent of<BR>the black on the throat is virtually identical here in erythronotus<BR>and charmosyna, and this poor representation will only lead to<BR>confusion for anyone attempting to identify the species. The only<BR>difference shown is dark as opposed to pale lower belly to undertail<BR>coverts, and
 a subtle difference in flank colouration. I then examined<BR>Zimmermann and Turner, where the differences were much better<BR>illustrated, having used a bird resembling northern pale charmosyna,<BR>although again the erythronotus isn’t very impressive as regards to<BR>accuracy in colour it does at least show the extent of the black<BR>throat.<BR>Comparing my photographs of typical northern and eastern charmosyna<BR>with these southern birds, many features are shared, absence of red on<BR>chest and flanks, both with paler underparts than erythronotus, and<BR>paler lower belly to undertail coverts, but the northern and eastern<BR>birds show a very contrasting white throat and white forehead, as<BR>opposed to greyish. They do not show any black line across the throat<BR>at the base of the bill unlike the noticeable narrow black line of<BR>southern charmosyna (?). Their lower belly/undertail coverts region is<BR>much whiter, and overall the ground
 colouration is much paler.<BR>Southern birds are robust and dark-hued, not as dark as erythronotus,<BR>but nothing as pale as northern and eastern charmosyna, which also<BR>appear smaller, and much slighter and delicate in the field. The<BR>general appearance of southern charmosyna (?) is almost as robust as<BR>erythronotus.<BR>There is obviously a lot to learn about these three forms in Kenya,<BR>the southern form of charmosyna (?) having never been described. With<BR>the claim that dark charmosyna have occurred sympatrically with<BR>erythronotus on the Magadi road, such studies can start on our<BR>doorstep!<BR>This is only a preliminary “wake-up” to make birders aware of the<BR>interesting situation, wherever there is a “?” it means that now we<BR>need confirmation of the record.<BR>I have attached a selection of photographs of charmosyna from various<BR>locations, I apologise for the standard, but they all tell the story.<BR>It would be of
 interest if everyone could dig out their erythronotus<BR>and charmosyna photographs and see what they have.<BR>Please look carefully at all of the Black-faced/cheeked Waxbills met<BR>with in this country, and in border areas with Tanzania, and report on<BR>what form is where, and especially if there is any area of sympatry.<BR>Best to all<BR>Brian<BR><BR><BR><BR>MORE ON BLACK-CHEEKED/FACED WAXBILLS…..<BR>Dear All,<BR>I have done some more research regarding Black-cheeked Waxbill<BR>Estrilda charmosyna.<BR>I have received emails from Neil Baker and Matt Aeberhard in Tanzania<BR>who say that they have never come across the bird in Tanzania, and<BR>that there are no records south of our border.<BR>I stated incorrectly that the southern dark form was undescribed, this<BR>was wrong it is described as distinct from the nominate, as Estrilda<BR>charmosyna kiwanukae. On trying to learn more of this I came across<BR>the following.<BR><BR>Mackworth-Praed and
 Grant<BR>Treat erythronotus (race delamerei) and charmosyna as erythronotus,<BR>not being aware of kiwanukae. Charmosyna has an eastern and northern<BR>distribution.<BR><BR>Stevenson and John Fanshawe<BR>Make no mention of the existence of kiwanukae, even though that is<BR>what they have illustrated instead of the widespread nominate. The map<BR>shows no crossing into Tanzania.<BR><BR>Zimmermann and Turner<BR>Give details of the dark second form of Black-cheeked as Estrilda<BR>charmosyna kiwanukae, but the range is endemic to Magadi Road as far<BR>as Olorgesailie and sympatric with Estrilda erythronotus delamerei<BR>over this range. Their map shows its proximity to the Tanzanian<BR>border, but not quite reaching it.<BR><BR>Britton<BR>Is pre erythronotus/charmosyna split and both are treated under<BR>Black-cheeked Waxbill, the pre-split name which now is reserved for<BR>charmosyna. However the distribution under the charmosyna umbrella<BR>with no mention
 or recognition of kiwanukae, is given as also<BR>occurring in Thika, Simba and both East and West Tsavo, as well as<BR>Lake Magadi/Olorgesailie.<BR><BR>Howard and Moore<BR>Recognises&nbsp; charmosyna as distinct from erythronotus, and the<BR>existence of three races of charmosyna.&nbsp; Nominate is in Somalia, S.<BR>Ethiopia, S. Sudan, Uganda and N. Kenya. A race pallidior is given as<BR>C. Kenya, which presumably relates to the Thika record in Britton.<BR>Finally kiwanukae is given as S Kenya and N. Tanzania.<BR><BR>Clements<BR>Compounds the story by calling erythronotus Black-cheeked Waxbill, and<BR>charmosyna as Red-rumped Waxbill! However whilst not recognising<BR>pallidior, he does list nominate as much the same distribution as<BR>Howard and Moore, except in Kenya where he has it only in the NE.<BR>Kiwanukae is given S Kenya to extreme N Tanzania.<BR><BR>Clement, Harris and Davis, Finches and Sparrows<BR>This is the monograph of the estrildids.
 More confusion in common<BR>names as Black-faced Waxbill is used for the DRC endemic Estrilda<BR>nigriloris. They were not recognising charmosyna as a species, and<BR>include it in with erythronotus which they call Black-cheeked Waxbill.<BR>Monograph or not, a look at the plate will show an enormous screw-up.<BR>I started reading the text, and they were stating that delamerei was<BR>very different from the southern nominate, and so I wanted to see just<BR>how different it looked on the plate (45), and lo and behold the bird<BR>labelled as delamerei is in fact kiwanukae race of charmosyna, so then<BR>looking at what they were calling charmosyna, it is in fact delamerei!<BR>Of the five illustrations there is no nominate charmosyna illustrated.<BR>Referring back to the text, it further stated that charmosyna might be<BR>a distinct species from erythronotus.&nbsp; For distributions charmosyna is<BR>given as extending south to Tsavo East and West, kiwanukae
 though is<BR>given southern Kenya from Magadi to Teita (which mean an overlap of<BR>charmosyna and kiwanukae in Tsavos!!!), to Olduvai and Dodoma, N.<BR>Tanzania. They do not mention pallidior.<BR><BR>So the truth of these three forms in East Africa is still wide open<BR>for some proper investigation, as it would seem that in all<BR>publications, only confusion reigns.<BR><BR>Best to all<BR>Brian<BR><BR>&nbsp;</DIV>I'd rather go birding...<BR>***************************************<BR>Itai Shanni <BR>Manager <BR>Hula Birdwatching Centre <BR>Israel Ornithological Centre (BirdLife partner in Israel) <BR>TEL: +972-523-689773 <BR>iochula@inter.net.il <BR>itaisha1@yahoo.com
