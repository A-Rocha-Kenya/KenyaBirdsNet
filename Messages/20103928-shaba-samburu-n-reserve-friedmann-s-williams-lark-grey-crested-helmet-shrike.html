Dear all<br>
Greetings hoping this find you all well. Here is a quick report of a
short birding trip with half a day in Nairobi National Park, 2 days in
Samburu/Shaba National Reserve and 2 hours in Naivasha. On the
18<sup>th</sup> of May, Gareth Bullock and I visited Nairobi National
Park between 0900 -1400hrs. It was already quiet and though we supposed
to arrive at 8 to the park gate but I were late to pick him as I had
reroute after part of the thika road was blocked which costed a whole
hour. However, at the main gate we had the resident Northern Double
Collared Sunbird just before entering.&nbsp; At the Ivory Burning site
were 2 or more Scaly Francolin that were never seen, Good looks and songs
from the African Mustached Warblers,&nbsp; both Little and Horus Swifts
and later in the Kisembe Forest 3 Nairobi Pipits, a Ruppells Robin Chat
mimicking an African Crowned Eagle and later a Narina Trogon before
singing out her usual 1,2,3 song/count. A Great Sparrowhawk flew above
the forest, and were 2 Hartlaubs Turaco, 2 White-headed Barbets, were
seen.<br><br>
In the grass plain 2 separate Harlequin Quails (male and female) and 1
Pangani Longclaw near the Kingfisher Picnic site and not far away from
the Yellow-throated Longclaw we had seen before, Red-billed Oxpecker
missing the Yellow-billed,&nbsp; a few of the parks cisiticolas were
seen including Winding, Rattling, Siffling, Stout and Singing. At the
Kinfisher Picnic site were 2 Red-throated Tits together with the
White-bellied Tits and which was my first ones that far from the Hippo
pools. Lots of White-winged and Red-collared Widowbirds in breeding
plumage but not any Jacksons.<br><br>
We left the park at 1400hrs picking Jonathan Angliss from the hotel
heading to Thikas Blue Post Hotel. A late afternoon one and a half hour
walk produced the usual <b>Olive Grey Greenbuls</b> (one of the 26
species Jonathan wanted) and was a bit hard to hear them as the river
turbulence was such a noise, Zanzibar Greenbull was heard but not seen, 2
Giant Kingfisher flew along the river and my first one for Blue Post
<b>Scaly Francolin</b> ( a single individual perched on the tree at
1830hrs) Not sure its a resident as I have neither heard them before nor
seen them here. This reminds me twice I have seen single Muscovy Duck by
the river sharing the water and perch not far from the African Finfoot .
There was also a Green-backed Honeybird, Red-fronted Tinkerbird and on
the fig perched a Great Sparrowhawk.<br><br>
The following morning we left at 0700hrs for Shaba Game Reserve making a
first stop at the Tana Power Station where.&nbsp; Here we got the endemic
<b>Hindes Babbler</b> (one well seen and a few more calling from the
bushes) The birds appearing here was a great relieve and saved our 40km
to and fro to the Wajeeh Nature Park as it was another most sort out bird
for the party. I wonder when last they may have been seen here Other
birds here included 2 Tawny Eagle, our 3<sup>rd</sup> sighting of the
Great Sparrowhawk, consider Jonathans last 3 or 4 visit he had not seen
any until last year in sept when he saw only one, now they were appearing
like to be&nbsp; common. A single African Mustached Warbler singing, Lots
of African Golden Weavers nesting in trees submerged in the water. The
level is high and the power station must be busy charging there batts
while its raining. A flock of African Green Pigeons flew above us, 2
White-headed Barbets. The plains near Naro Moru produced another needed
bird the <b>Jacksons Widowbirds</b> about 4 individual and only one male
was pomping up and down the courtship. Also a few Long-tailed. Timau had
Augur Buzzards and a Long-crested Eagle along the road and the usual site
at the junction had a Boran Cisticola who was readily singing. There was
also unconfirmed sighting of the Northern Grosbeak Canary which we left
as unknown or a just a Brimstone Carnary as we only had a few secs of
view. But had a heavier bill and much larger than a Brimstone but left it
out as it seemed much higher for the species. However, anyone visiting
the site please just keep an eye.<br><br>
Just before the gate to the Shaba National Reserve a couple of
Bristle-crowned Starlings and a few hundreds of Chestnut Weaver,
Red-billed Quilea, 2 Black-throated Barbet, an assortment of Emerald
spotted Wood, African Mourning, Ring-necked, Laughing, Namaqua Doves
quench their thirst along the stream. <br><br>
Arrived at the Sarova Shaba Game Lodge for late lunch and there were
Water Thicknees by the bank opposite the lodge, one <b>Little Sparrowhawk
</b>in the lodge gardens. Immediately after lunch we set out for game
drive at 1530 hours birding. Very green or very above the areas standard
and had a Harlequin Quail fly from the road, the dry wet land near the
lodge hard over 50 males <b>Cardinal Quilea </b>and apparently happens to
be new record for the atlas square 51B, 30 Males <b>Fire-fronted
Bishop</b>,&nbsp; 5 <b>White-winged Widowbirds</b>,&nbsp; 1 male
<b>Yellow-crowned Bishop </b>another new record for the atlas square, 1
<b>Yellow Bishop</b> away from the site.&nbsp; All the 4 bishops were new
for me in these area.<br><br>
A single <b>Shikra</b> was seen too, and 1 <b>Red-necked Falcon</b>
another new one of the part of the reserve, White-fronted Bee-eaters
were&nbsp; common all over the reserve. Lots of Fischers Sparrow Larks
and only 2 <b>Chestnut-headed Sparrow Larks</b>, some of the birds that
had taken us there like the <b>Friedmanns Lark</b> were (8 individuals)
in plenty singing and displaying and a few more heard but not seen so
guessing somewhere more or less than 20 in the area we visited before I
have seen one or even heard just one. Never seen them displaying and
wonder if they could be nesting in such a period of heavy long rains? Had
a 2 Taita Fiscals and no Somali Fiscal, one male and one female Eastern
Paradise Whydah individually, Black-bellied and Hunters Sunbirds, Golden
Pipits were common in their breeding pajamas doing their butterfly
dance.<br><br>
The following morning spent the half day in Samburu National Reserve
returning for lunch and thats where we found our first Vulturine
Guineafowl, 2 female Somali Ostriches, a Hooded Vulture, 2 Verreaux
Eagles, 2 Tawny Eagles, 1 Bateleur, 2 Pale Chanting Goshawk, I Black
Kite,&nbsp; 1 Pigmy Falcon, 2 Martial Eagle, and could not locate the
resident Palm nut Vulture, 1 imm Great Spotted Cuckoo and probably the
resident at this time of the year,&nbsp; a <b>White-headed
Mousebird</b>,&nbsp; Taita Fiscals again with no Somali, thousands of
Red-billed Quilea with a few hundred Chestnut Weavers a male Steal-blue
Whyday was a new for me too in the reserve.<br><br>
Back to the Shaba and after lunch we headed out again just to find 2 more
<b>Black Kites</b> the bird I usually associate with towns which may mean
the Archers Post is quite growing:; its all tarmacd, electricity, 1
Shikra and 1 Gabar Goshawk, an immature Martial Eagle who stared at us 3
mtrs away and one who kept rotating the face and starring at us; eyes in
vertical position.no idea what that meant but he was youngstar
though,&nbsp; 2 African Hawk Eagle perched on a dead tree,&nbsp; 10
<b>Friedmanns Larks</b> again 6 seen and others heard, Fawn Collared
Larks and Pink-breasted Larks and 2 Secretary Birds in a nest. A
Pearl-spotted Owlet replied a call at the lodge in the evening.<br><br>
The following morning of 21<sup>st</sup> left for the Williams Lark and
on the way was 4 helmeted Guineafowls with 3 juvs, 1 Secretary Bird, 8
Vulturine Guineafowl, a Black-chested Snake Eagle, 2 African Hawk Eagles
flying high (prob the same individual seen last afternoon), African
Orange-bellied Parrots, a Dark Morph of a Black-and-White Cuckoo (my
first dark morph), over 20 White-throated Bee-eaters, 2 Yellow-billed
Hornbills. <br><br>
It was so scary for me when I arrive at the <b>Williams Lark</b>s plain
just to find the area was fully covered by grass (easily the grassy plain
could be sold to a potential wheat farmer just to find the boulder lava
desert after the rains are gone), first I thought they would no longer be
there as it was a total change of habitat type and secondly if they were
spotting one would the hardest thing and may be day after. Went through
the first patch with no luck and moved further and immediately saw four
of them displaying just like other larks flying up flapping like they are
learning how to hover and coming down. In one area of about 0.6 km2 there
were a 10 individual most displaying while 2 of them were seen carrying
food, Though there really was not time to find the nest I was granted
some time and I did spend like 15 min to do that but in vain.&nbsp; Very
eager that this would have been the first nest ever of the species but
also probably the first bird reported to have been seen carrying food
meaning the birds must have been feeding some youngones. Unless the males
will lure the females with some token like some cuckoos I have observed.
My other wonder and feeling is that these are the periods they probably
nest, year of heavy and such long rains. Something else important to note
were the huge influx of tiny grasshoppers, katydids and or locusts too
may be this is part of their diet though I have to say that the 2
individuals carrying food were caterpillar/worm types and none of the
three. In the area was atleast a single Red-winged Lark while most of the
trees around was a nesting site for the DonaldsonSmith Sparrow Weavers.
We did missed the prestige Masked Lark but unfortunately had little time
again.<br><br>
On our way back we had 5 more Friedmanns Lark, 3 <b>Ashy Cisticolas</b>,
about 20 Magpie Starlings, a couple wattled Starling and Golden-breasted
Starlings, a pair Red-fronted Warbler and Mouse-coloured Penduline Tit, 1
Fire-fronted Bishop.<br><br>
Way up on the Timau again a single Long-crested Eagle and 6 males
Jacksons Widowbirds on the wheat fields with&nbsp; a few Yellow-crowned
Canary, a late lunch at the Naru Moru River Lodge where the garden had a
few Tacazze sunbirds and afterwards left for the <b>Mackinders Eagle Owl
</b>and with the help of Mureithi the Owl Man we found 1 (if you ever
cant reach him on fone try stopping at the small trading centre 3 km
before and ask the guys selling onions, they know him as Dudu Man Owl
Man in Kikuyu. This has worked more than a few times for me.) In the
vicinity was a pair of Long-billed Pipits and a bunch of Nyanza Swift.
While dropping Gareth at Nyeri for a transfer to the airport a single
Peregrine Falcon flys above.<br><br>
On 22<sup>nd</sup> the interest was on Abyssinian Ground Thrush,
Scarlet-tufted Malachite Sunbird, Mustached Green Tinkerbird, Kenriks
Starling and Fine-banded Woodpecker. This would have taken us to Met
Station, Sirimon route and Meru and knew it was a long day. On arrival at
the main gate to Mt Kenya National Park we were told the roads were
unpassable or were washed by the recent rains having an option of only
walking.&nbsp; We opted to leave for Naivasha for the <b>Grey-crested
Helmet Shrike</b> which was still a mystery bird for Jonathan. I did want
to stop at the Nyahururu at the forest as I knew there were the
tinkerbirds there but gave priority to the hard species helmet shrike. We
arrived at the Crater Lake at 1600hrs and had only 2 hours before dark.
After an hour 10 min a family of 6 showed up becoming Jonathans
20<sup>th</sup> bird of his wanted list. Watched them for like 15 min
then we left for Nairobi calling at the Elsamere Centre for the
Hilderbrant Francolin which are resident there and we were lucky again
one started calling and we tracked and later he came out and perched on a
dead log to sing. We left at 1847hrs for the airport arriving close to
2100hrs.<br><br>
good birding <br>
and many thanks<br>
