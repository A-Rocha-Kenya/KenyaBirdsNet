  <pre>Greetings birders

A pair of Ostrich with 20 small chicks in Nairobi National Park on 31
August.

A flock of Eurasian Bee-eaters on the birdwalk in Langata on 1st September.

Other notes: The arrow-poison tree/shrub with large shiny leaves
(Acokanthera oppositifolia) is in fragrant bloom all over Nairobi, from
Paradise Lost to the Safari Walk.

Today 1st September, KWS did not allow me to top up my old smart card,
requires that we buy new smart cards at one thousand shillings (and bring
documentation).

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
