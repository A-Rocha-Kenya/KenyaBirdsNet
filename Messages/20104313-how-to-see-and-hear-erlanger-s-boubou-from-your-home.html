  <pre>Dear All,
Whilst struggling to work out how to make the 500MB video file of
Erlanger&#39;s Boubou at Manda Island available for viewing, I have in the
meantime successfully posted a 50KB segment to the Nature Kenya
website  &#34;naturekenya1000.ning.com&#34; and it should be viewable there.
The segment contains two different calls but is only a fraction of the
original. (Under Videos). I have also posted images of the bird (Under
Photos) and the text as posted on the Net (Under Nature. Although it
seems to be allocated to Sky and Insects!).
For regional birders, most will already be members but there is a
potential for this site to make other local birding interests more
accessible when it comes to images and videos to compliment
&#34;kenyabirdsnet.&#34; Those that aren&#39;t members of Nature Kenya probably
should be!
Best to all
Brian
