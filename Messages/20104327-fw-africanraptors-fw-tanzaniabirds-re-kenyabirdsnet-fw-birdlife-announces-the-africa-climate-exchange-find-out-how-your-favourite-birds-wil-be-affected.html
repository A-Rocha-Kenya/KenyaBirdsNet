<DIV><SPAN style="COLOR: #1f497d; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Dear all,<O></O></SPAN></DIV>

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="COLOR: #1f497d; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">I have not read 
the offending document and normally would not comment on issues relating to the 
range and migration of birds of which I know little. I wonder at the need of 
some species to migrate and whether &nbsp;the deep seated compulsion to depart 
from winter climes can be ever influenced by climate change. &nbsp;While, 
perhaps, it is easier to understand why birds flee an approaching winter it 
bewilders me that they choose to go back when food remains plentiful and climate 
&nbsp;benign. Why embark on a hazardous and potentially unrewarding journey? It 
seems to me that irrespective of the progression of climate change the birds are 
so immutably programmed to compass and clock, they will fly irrespective of 
altered or changing circumstances or degree of risk. <O></O></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="COLOR: #1f497d; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">However, my 
musings are not the reason for my intervention. As a climatologist with 40 years 
experience of African weather with half of that time spent as the chief 
atmospheric scientist responsible for addressing climate change impacts under 
the World Climate Programme, I can say that while it is probable that climate is 
changing as a consequence of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, there is 
limited understanding of the likely speed of global warming or of the level it 
might reach globally irrespective of mitigation policies. Furthermore, the 
nature and extent of regional or national climate change, especially in the 
tropics are not understood at all beyond imperfect model projections based on 
limited, incomplete and imperfect data sets. It is not possible at present to 
identify with any certainty, a climate change signal in Africa. The African 
climate is highly variable and it is this extreme variability often influenced 
by large scale ocean-atmosphere interactions that are currently more significant 
than the projected anthropogenic climate change. In my opinion, it is not 
possible to make believable projections of altered ranges or movement of bird 
species based on imperfect predictions of regional climate change. Destruction 
&nbsp;of habitat and other effects of human population increases are having, and 
will have a profound negative effect on nature including wildlife and birds. 
Climate change, in comparison, has currently little impact and even when it 
changes sufficiently to be a factor in bird behavior, I am afraid people will 
still wield the greater influence. Environmental groups in Kenya are fighting a 
battle to protect the Tana River delta. It is an important staging area for 
migrating birds, It is home to important and rare flora and fauna. Pastoralists 
use the abundant grazing and water as a refuge against regional drought, It has 
the potential to become a valuable income-generating eco-tourism site. Yet it is 
threatened by many local and multi-national developers who would clear the 
forests and convert the pastures to large-scale rice and sugar cultivation for 
export, Others wish to mine it for its minerals and a foreign government seeks 
the land to grow food for its country in exchange for engineering development . 
Nature there will be destroyed for ever. Avian migratory routes &nbsp;and 
habitat ranges will be forced to change but it will not be a consequence of 
climate.<O></O></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">While Climate Change is "real" 
it's effect on Africa's birdlife is currently insignificant compared to the 
effect of this&nbsp;rapid human population growth. Many of the range shifts and 
local&nbsp;extirpations we are witnessing can be laid at the door of habitat 
degradation.&nbsp;A warmer climate will exaggerate&nbsp;the desiccation of 
marginal habitats but habitat change due to over exploitation&nbsp;should 
be&nbsp;far more of a concern to all of us living today. There really are people 
in Europe who are looking at suggesting changing the borders of our protected 
areas to accommodate range shifts "in the future"...if only wild Africa had a 
future......<WBR>.......</SPAN><O></O></P></DIV>
<DIV>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Using a flawed data set (esp 
when more accurate data exists) and applying questionable models will do nothing 
to enhance bird conservation in Africa.</SPAN><O></O></P></DIV>
<DIV>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">We must look to habitat 
protection&nbsp;and wise use&nbsp;with long term improvements in local 
agriculture (permaculture is the key word here) NOT huge mechanised farms 
growing food and biofuel for Middle Eastern and Far Eastern countries or bottom 
line accounting for Western European timber companies. The long term, indeed the 
only, solution to Africa's problems lies with an EDUCATED population who will 
control it's own growth,&nbsp;prosperity and eventually it's own 
destiny.</SPAN></P>
