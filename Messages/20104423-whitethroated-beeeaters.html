  <pre>Further to all the correspondence on White throated 
Beeeaters, I noticed that the birds that usually frequent the first 
quarter of the Shimoni access road from Kanana, the village 
where you turn off the main Lunga Lunga road to Kiwanmbale 
disappeared around mid May. We usually see them at various 
points along this road sitting on the power lines, but they 
weren&#39;t there. They were back there earlier this week on the 
19th July and I imagine will now stick around until next year.
Where they went in the intervening 2 months I do not know!
