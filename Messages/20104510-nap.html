  <pre>On Monday I took Paul Benson up on a kind offer to join him in the Nairobi NaP.  We arranged to meet at 6am, which proved far too early for the gate office staff - they arrived 40 minutes late!!

We had a great morning, despite the unkind cloudy sky that limited the photography opportunities.

One highlight was the sighting of a Rosy-breasted Longclaw.  Photo at:

I would like to know if this is as unusual a sighting as I believe it to be - my Stevenson &amp; Franshawe is a little unclear on typical distribution.

Many Thanks Chris
