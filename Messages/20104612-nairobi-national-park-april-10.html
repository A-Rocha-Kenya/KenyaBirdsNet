  <pre>Hi All,

Follow up On Fluers nnp post, NNP : 11th April, Loads of red collared widowbirds in beautiful breeding gowns.

Grey Crowned cranes with 2 chicks.

And a Martial Eagle, juv, feeding on what seemed to be a chick, possibly one of the Crane&#39;s chicks or Kori Chick. But not sure about that. However, it was feeding on a chick.

Happy Birding.
