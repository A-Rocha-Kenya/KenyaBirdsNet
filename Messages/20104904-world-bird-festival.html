  <pre>To honour the World Bird Festival I did a 12 hour bird watch in my garden in Hardy estate, Langata. Highlights were my first Eurasian Golden Oriole for the season and the fledged Great Sparrowhawk roosting above my head (every evening for the last week). The birdbath was used by Forest Robin, Golden-rumped Tinkerbird and Cabanis&#39; Greenbul amongst others. There was a trio of African Woodowls competing against the Hyraxes, Bushbabies and Montane Nightjars for dominance of the sounds of the night.

This data was entered into Kenyabirdfinder http://www.worldbirds.org and the list is reproduced below.
