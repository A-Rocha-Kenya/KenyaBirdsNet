  <pre>Hi there,

Over December, I took some shots in Tsavo east and in Migori. I have uploaded them in the link http://www.flickr.com/photos/38040658@N03/with/4258289295/

If someone has time you could help me with the ID&#39;s.If you have a yahoo email address you could actually log in and comment on the flickr site.


Cheers

Ikawa J.Victor
