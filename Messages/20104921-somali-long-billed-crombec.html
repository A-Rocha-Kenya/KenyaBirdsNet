<DIV>Hi all</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>is there any evidence to suggest a southwards expansion of range of this bird in recent years ? our first record for Tanzania was in Mkomazi GR in Nov 94. Since then there have been at least 4 obs from this, now NP, and more recently a record near Same in August this year and then another from the Kitwei Plain last week. This latter site is 150km from the Kenya border in a straight line through the Mkomazi gap between the West Usambara and South Pare mts.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>whist observer effort (esp the lack of it) will play some part in the paucity of records there is a suggestion here of an expansion of range.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>any comments most welcome.</DIV>
