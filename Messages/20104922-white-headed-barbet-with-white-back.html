  <pre>Greetings birders

Paradise Lost in Kiambu near Nairobi is an excellent birding site. On July
21, Nature Kenya&#39;s Wednesday morning birdwalk had fabulous views of
White-backed Ducks and other wetland birds in the seasonal wetland on the
coffee estate.

Most exciting, however, were two White-headed Barbets on the eastern side of
the recreational site. One of the birds was white with black wings and a
black triangle on the back (white &#34;back straps&#34; between the triangle and the
wings). 

The other bird was entirely white except for the black wings and beak. It
was very beautiful.

White-headed Barbets are very variable, with a number of different
sub-species. However, I have never seen an all-white (except for the wings)
individual before.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
