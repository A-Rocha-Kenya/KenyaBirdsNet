Dear birders,<BR>
As part of follow up with Migrants for Likipia last week of Northern Wheatear, I had one 4 days a go a Baringo as well this morning at Kakamega Forest walk, I had my first GREY WAGTAIL in the forest streams, I was also luck to have seen Male Oriole Finch the first time record for me in this forest. I have seen it before at Mountain Lodge but almost 10yrs now since then. Good birding so far all/Most of&nbsp;&nbsp;Great Blue Turacco are busy Nesting and you will rearly see them during the day but are active early morning hours and late evening hours. As alway great birding in the forest!!<BR>

Cheers!!<BR>
