    After quite a time meditating above Zimmerman pages 86f, 96f, 100f
    and 308f, I agree with Adam Kennedy, it was a Ayres's Hawk-Eagle.<br>
    <br>
    Let's start with the head:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="cid:part1.00000609.07020101@gmail.com" alt=""><br>
    Juvenile African Crowned Eagle: “Pale buff or whitish head [...]
    grey eyes” Adult: “pale yellow eyes” (p.96)<br>
    Juvenile Ayres's Hawk-Eagle: “buff or pale rufous [...] face”
    (p.100) “Pale rufous supercilliary stripes usually present [...]
    eyes pale grey brown” (308)<br>
    The bill shown in the drawing of Adult African Crowned Eagle (p.97)
    is indeed enormous -- ours is less impressive.<br>
    So this point goes to Ayres's, I think.<br>
    <br>
    On the opposite side:<br>
    <img src="cid:part2.05050001.09080406@gmail.com" alt=""><br>
    Juvenile African Crowned Eagle: “black-spotted leg and tarsal
    feathers” (p.96)<br>
    The spots we saw on the breast clearly stop before the legs – all
    the rest including light yellow toes etc. is pretty similar.<br>
    Another point to Ayres's. <br>
     <br>
    Finally if we have a look under his (or her? although males tend to
    have a more whitish face, while females tend to be darker in adults
    at least – let's assume it is a he) … under /his/ wings:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="cid:part3.00020302.06040208@gmail.com" alt=""><br>
    <br>
    There is some blur due to the movement (he has not learned yet to
    pause during flight for the photographer's sake), still we'd expect
    stronger contrast in the mid-wing bands if it was an immature
    African Crowned Eagle (p.87).<br>
    <br>
    Finally 3:0 for the Ayres's the preference of moister habitat might
    add another half a point …  <br>
    <br>
    Best regards,<br>
    Georg<br>
