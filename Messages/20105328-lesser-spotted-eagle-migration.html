<P><STRONG>Summary</STRONG></P><STRONG></STRONG>
<P><BR>A breeding pair of Lesser Spotted Eagles Aquila pomarina in Germany was 
each fitted<BR>with satellite transmitters and the information obtained from 
3,641 locations was analysed. </P>
<P>Four autumn and two spring migrations were recorded in their entirety 
and<BR>one further autumn migration in part only. The pair, which travelled 
separately, wintered<BR>in Zambia (the male), Zimbabwe, South Africa and 
Mozambique (the female),<BR>approximately 9,350 and 11,350 km distant from their 
nesting territory. The annual<BR>cycles of the two birds differed considerably. 
In 1998 the female spent 48 % of the year<BR>on migration, 43 % at the nest site 
and only 9 % in her winter quarters. The male spent<BR>44 % in the breeding 
territory, 35 % on migration and 21 % at his wintering grounds.<BR>The length of 
time spent on migration varied between 52 and 119 days (mean 81 days).<BR>For 
both birds the autumn migration was longer (74-119 days) than the spring 
migration<BR>(52-64 days). The speed while migrating varied during a single 
journey and<BR>from year to year. The fastest flying speed was achieved while 
crossing the Sahara<BR>desert. On average, the female always travelled more 
slowly than the male. For both<BR>birds, the greatest daily distance flown on 
all migrations was 521 km over northern<BR>Sudan. Cross-country speed was 
ranging between 50 and 60 km/h were calculated<BR>to be reached on eight out of 
33 determinations. On one occasion, the cross-country<BR>speed was as great as 
66.8 km/h.</P>
<P><BR>Delayed spring migration, which in recent years has frequently led to the 
failure of<BR>many pairs to breed, also occurred with this pair. This phenomenon 
warrants further<BR>research because of its obvious impact upon 
breeding.</P></DIV></FONT></FONT></DIV></FONT></FONT></DIV></FONT></FONT></BODY></HTML>
