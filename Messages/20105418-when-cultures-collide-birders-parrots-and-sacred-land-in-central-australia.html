  <pre>Dear all,

Yesterday I posted an article on some serious cross-cultural and heritage issues that arose when, following a long season of unexpected rain, an irruption of the exceedingly rare and exceedingly beautiful Princess Parrot Polyetis alexandrae occurred. 

For mine it is an example of the importance of ethical dealings in natural history.

The obsession with the Princess Parrot has nearly killed several
birdos already in the recent past.

My article is posted here: http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/42384.html

Cheers and I look forward to your comments.
