  <pre>Dear All,
Very briefly as I am having a couple of days between tours. Be very
very wary of Tsavo Red-faced as they are much much paler than normal
birds and a trap for the unwary. I would imagine that this very pallid
form extends into Mkomazi and further south. These birds are pale
buffy grey lacking the reddish tones throughout (including any trace
on the face). I don&#39;t think that SLBC has shown any southwards
tendency. The bill is so long that it looks like an Anthreptes
sunbird. I will send some images over when I return,
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Hi all
&gt;
&gt; is there any evidence to suggest a southwards expansion of range of this
&gt; bird in
&gt; recent years ? our first record for Tanzania was in Mkomazi GR in Nov 94.
&gt; Since
&gt; then there have been at least 4 obs from this, now NP, and more recently a
&gt; record near Same in August this year and then another from the Kitwei Plain
&gt; last
&gt; week. This latter site is 150km from the Kenya border in a straight line
&gt; through
&gt; the Mkomazi gap between the West Usambara and South Pare mts.
&gt;
&gt; whist observer effort (esp the lack of it) will play some part in the
&gt; paucity of
&gt; records there is a suggestion here of an expansion of range.
&gt;
&gt; any comments most welcome.
