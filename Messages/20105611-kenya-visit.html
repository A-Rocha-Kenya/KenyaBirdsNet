  <pre>Dear All,

A few notes from a recent short visit to Kenya. I&#39;e tried to concentrate on
unusual species or migrants to Kenya.

Nairobi NP (27th Dec): Brian has probably already posted the species from
this visit.

Samburu/Buffalo Springs (30th Dec - 1st Jan): The reserve was very green,
and birds were busy breeding, with Chestnut Weaver being especially
prevalent. Migrants included a couple of European Rock Thrushes, a good
number of Isabelline and Northern Wheatears, and a few European Rollers. One
unusual Wheatear reminded me of Cyprus Pied, but with winter plumage it was
hard to tell. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t have time to photo it. Unusual things
were lack of some species. A single Eastern Chanting Goshawk, only 2
White-crowned Shrikes and no White-bellied Go-away Birds. Somali Courser,
Somali Ostrich and Somali Bee-eater were all seen reasonably easily.

Emali - Amboseli: There were about 500 or more White Storks about 5km along
the new road from Emali to Samburu. ON the way back, they were mostly just
along Mombasa Road just to the east of the Amboseli junction.

Amboseli (1st Jan - 3rd Jan): Now greening up well. There were lots of
migrant waders, with good numbers of Ruff, Little Stints, Wood and Marsh
Sandpipers. There were a couple of Black-tailed Godwits. There were about a
dozen Northern Shoveler, and large numbers of Barn Swallows. There was a
group of about 20 European Rollers outside of the reserve near to the new
tarmac road.

Now back in snowy Britain!
