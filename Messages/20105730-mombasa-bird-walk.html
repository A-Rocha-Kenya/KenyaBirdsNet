<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dear Birders,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Almost forgot to report.&nbsp; All this referendum 
excitement.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Sat Aug. 21st saw us going up to the Husein Dairy 
Land in Nguu Tatu to cover the right hand side of the road, the wetland, that 
used to be a pond and the surrounding grassland.&nbsp; Small pond on 
the&nbsp;way up had a pair of White Faced Whistling Ducks with about 10 very 
little ducklings.&nbsp; Hope they all survive the Crows and other predators 
especially the monitor lizards. A single Little Grebe ducked and dived, Golden 
Palm and Grosbeak Weavers busy nesting and one or two Barn Swallows flying 
around.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>At the wetland, a couple of Madagascar Bee-Eaters, 
Superb and Greater Blue Earred Starlings, a Croaking Cisticola on the reeds and 
wonder of wonders a Hammerkop (hardly ever seen here)&nbsp;flying by.&nbsp; 
Large numbers of Red Billed Quelea and Cattle Egrets. Am immature Yellow 
throated Longclaw and on the oppostie side of the road a magnificent adult 
Pangani's.&nbsp; Namaqua Doves flashed past on their way to roost and a Black 
Shouldered Kite passed overhead.&nbsp; The best bird of the day was the Bat Hawk 
flying low over our heads, after a conversation about how we had not seen one 
for ages.&nbsp; Twenty Eight species in all.&nbsp; No Eurasian migrants except 
for the Barn Swallows although I have seen quite large flocks of waders flying 
past at the beach.&nbsp; Enjoy your birding!&nbsp; (Marlene Reid - 
Mombasa)</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>P.S.&nbsp; Just saw a Striped Kingfisher in the 
tall tree in the next garden - I haven't seen one literally for years, so quite 
exciting.&nbsp; At one time they seemed quite common but not these days.&nbsp; 
Crows being the cause I suppose!&nbsp; (MR)</FONT></DIV>
