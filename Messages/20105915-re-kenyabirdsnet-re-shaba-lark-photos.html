  <pre>Hi Chege,
Good to see you are keeping busy. Friedmann&#39;s seems to be having a
good year in Shaba, but I suspect they are residents in the same small
area. Singing seems to be more nomadic.
With regards to your photos, as you know Singing and Friedmann&#39;s look
virtually the same. I would imagine these images as F, but when
breeding they are richer rufous above and better marked underneath. It
is difficult to see the state of the feathering, but they might be
fresh and in which case I would go for Friedmann&#39;s immatures.
Send them to Colin Jackson and see if he can work anything out from
the state of the plumage.
Off on a Kenya tour starting tomorrow,
Very best for now
Brian

&gt;
&gt; Thanks Brian
&gt; for your ID which i would for sure and better trust than mine. I
&gt; thought i was looking at a much heavier bill
&gt;
&gt; Just came from shaba and can&#39;t figure out if this would be the
&gt; Singing or Friedmann&#39;s Bush Lark. The photographed individual never
&gt; sang though other friedmann&#39;s were singing.
&gt;
&gt; many thanks

&gt;&gt;Hi Chege,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Nice to ear from you. Hope you&#39;re fine.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Brian also replied on my mail :
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Hi Patrick,
&gt;&gt;It&#39;s a Red-capped Lark bleached by the soda in the soil, many almost
&gt;&gt;lose all of their pattern,
&gt;&gt;Best for now
&gt;&gt;Brian
&gt;&gt;Anyway thank you very much. Athi Short-toed Lark was also my though
&gt;&gt;but for sure Brian knows much than me.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Can you tell me were in Crater Lake did you spot the Grey-crested
&gt;&gt;Helmetshrike? Near the lake?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thank you very much for the place you explained me last year for the
&gt;&gt;William&#39;s Lark. I found it exactly at that place. In fact I was
&gt;&gt;there one week after you.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Hope we can go birding together.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Best regards,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Patrick
