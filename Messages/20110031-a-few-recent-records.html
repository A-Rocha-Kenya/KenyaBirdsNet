  <div>Hi All,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Just to report a pair of Black-and-white Casqued Hornbills around Naibor this week and they (or another pair?) were seen near Ol Kiombo airstrip on 28th July also. Not so often seen around this part of the Mara.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>In camp this morning (31st) a fresh juvenile Pygmy Kingfisher allowed a very close approach (1m).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Neil in TZ - I guess you have the same ssp breeding in Serengeti; does this breeding date confer with records of your birds?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Very best,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Adam</div>
