  <pre>Greetings

At Athi Basin Dam in Nairobi National Park on 5 January 2011, there were a
young Greater Flamingo and a single Abdim&#39;s Stork among the usual
waterbirds. Also a Kori Bustard in the grasslands south of East Gate,
several Lesser Kestrels and masses of mammals.

Last week in Karura Forest, Nightingales were singing in the bushes at the
entrance to the old Shell-BP Sports Club.

Wishing you good birding in 2011, Fleur
