  Hi All,<br><br>Just wanted to share news of a female/ non-breeding male Chestnut Weaver that I saw feeding with our resident Village Weavers in camp this morning. By the time I had fetched my camera from the office it had moved on but I&#39;m hoping it will return again tomorrow for its photo to be taken.<br>
<br>This is my first record of the species in the Mara and was not on Brian&#39;s extensive Mara list so could be first for the Mara, although being a classic &quot;rains-wanderer&quot; it is probably much under-reported. <br>
<br>Also, a Spotted Eagle Owl being mobbed by various passerines in camp on 20th Feb was my first in the Mara.<br><br>All the best,<br><br>Adam<br>Naibor Camp, Masai Mara <br><br><div style="visibility: hidden; left: -5000px; position: absolute; z-index: 9999; padding: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px; overflow: hidden; word-wrap: break-word; color: black; font-size: 10px; text-align: left; line-height: 130%;" id="avg_ls_inline_popup">
