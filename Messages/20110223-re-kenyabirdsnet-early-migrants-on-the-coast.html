      <p>On July 2nd Albert and I did a waterbird count at Sabaki River Mouth <br>
with Joseph from the Sabaki Conservation Group where numbers of birds <br>
were as expected pretty low. However there were a few surprises with two <br>
Little Stints in full breeding plumage and three Common Sandpipers - <br>
which is a pretty early date for both. A week later we were back but <br>
there were no Little Stint though we saw five Common Sand.<br>
<br>
Madagascar Prats have been in good numbers at Sabaki and this morning I <br>
had 45 overhead just in the patch behind Turtle Bay Beach Club - exact <br>
same spot I had the Greater Short-toed Lark 18 months ago - you would <br>
never have thought it much of a birding site but it&#39;s actully <br>
surprisingly interesting. Today there were good numbers of Violet-backed <br>
Starlings, some stunning full plumaged male Black-winged Bishops, all <br>
three common Accipiters (Af, Little and Great), plenty of African Golden <br>
Orioles and Mouse-coloured Sunbird.<br>
<br>
We&#39;ve got the Masked Booby in a spacious enclosure just off the beach <br>
together with the Bridled Tern which is taking ages to moult out the <br>
totally hammered primaries that won&#39;t help it go anywhere. The booby, if <br>
anything seems like it was hand-reared as he just does not seem <br>
interested in leaving to go anywhere. We released him once only for him <br>
to end up begging fish off some kite-surfers a couple of days later 500m <br>
down the beach!<br>
<br>
Carmine Bee-eaters are moving through in reasonable numbers - the first <br>
seen that same day at Sabaki on 2nd July. There are also reports from <br>
Juma, the bird guide at the Mida Bird Hide, of White-crested Helmet <br>
Shrikes in the mangroves along by the hide - a species I&#39;ve never <br>
recorded from the coastline. At Sabaki on 10th July we also had my first <br>
Shikra for the seafront and again two Af. Grey Hornbills. A day later <br>
during our monday staff meeting we had four Af Grey Hornbills pass <br>
across infront of the A Rocha Kenya centre mid-morning - very bizarre.<br>
<br>
Clarke&#39;s Weavers have been very apparent in ASF but no sign of breeding <br>
activity. Malindi Pipits are still numerous around Arabuko Swamp next to <br>
the northern edge of the forest.<br>
<br>
Lots going on... and the migration from the north beginning to set in at <br>
least with waders and bee-eaters!<br>
