<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Hi Everyone,</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">After several days without a trace, I saw
the “Chestnut” Weaver at Naibor again this morning and this time I was armed
with the camera. Last time, I was in such a hurry to fetch the camera and
record the sighting that I didn’t spend as much time observing the bird as I should
have, and when I saw the bird again today, some alarm bells started
ringing...</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This morning, the weaver was in the midst
of 30+ Village Weaver and stood out clearly on account of it’s very washed out
plumage, obviously smaller size and apparent lack of any yellow tone – at least
on first impression (see IMG_1). Once again, the buffy chest and sharp white
edges to the wings were clearly visible but this time other features seemed to
contradict the identification...</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">IMG_2 – shows the bird perched where it
shows reddish-brown eye, chestnut-buff chest band and some fine dark streaking at
the top of the breast. Also, the legs appear to be grey – all positive. But look
at that bi-coloured bill – the lower mandible is almost white! Is this usual for Chestnut? There is also a yellowish
tinge to the supercilium and the same colour below the eye. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">IMG_3 – shows the bird on the deck.
Again the white edges to the flight feathers are clear to see and the back feathers lack
any hint of yellow or green – they are light brown with blackish centres.
However, there is clearly a yellowish tinge to the sides of the neck – would
this be expected on Chestnut Weaver?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">IMG_4 – shows the bird in comparison to a
Swahili Sparrow, both of which are clearly smaller than the Village Weaver
behind. This image also shows the yellowish tinge to the neck, cheeks and
supercilium. The face of the bird appears more like a Vitelline Masked Weaver
in this image, although the buffy chest and a little on the flanks can still be
seen.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Can the fundis please put me out of my
misery – is it Chestnut Weaver or not?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Many thanks,</span></p>
