Dear Birders,<BR>
I just want to report that I have seen Osprey this afternoon roost at Lake Nakuru National Park as well yesterday we have Wild dogs 3 of them at Aberdare National Park. I did wanted to cut a cross from Nyeri to Naivasha but the but road only 10kms to Mutubio Gate were horrible I&nbsp; got stuck for few minutes and then someone else who had a Toyota Prado came back advicing me not to try a bridge at Chania falls as the ditch was so big that even him got scare to get across. It took me another 5hrs to drive back to Treetops gate and then to Naivasha as it rained heavily while in the park and along the way.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
If you are thinking about the Aberdare cisticola and the rest of Aberdares specilities you better try from Mutubio gate and do not dare going pass Chania Falls if you are alone.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Happy birding all.<BR>
