  <pre>Hi All,

I&#39;m just having another clean up of my working list for Mara and
Serengeti. On the African Bird Club website - Kenya page - there are
the following records;

2009 - On 4 August, a Bar-tailed Trogon Apaloderma vittatum was
photographed in Masai Mara, where the species is rarely recorded.
2008 - A Least Honeyguide Indicator exilis was recorded at Kichwa
Tembo Camp on 2 July.

Does anyone have any information about these records such as the name
of the observer etc?

Many thanks

Adam
