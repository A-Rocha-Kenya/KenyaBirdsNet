  <pre>Greetings birders

Nature Kenya and the University of Nairobi&#39;s Wildlife Students Association
had a delightful morning outing on the Upper Kabete campus on March 12.

Migrants included Eurasian Nightjar in a tree, singing Blackcaps, Willow
Warblers and Tree Pipits Â­ we have seen many Tree Pipits this year.

Highlight of the resident birds was a Red-throated Wryneck.

We hope to make this joint outing a regular event.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
