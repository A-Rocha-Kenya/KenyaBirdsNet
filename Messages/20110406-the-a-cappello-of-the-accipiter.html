  <pre>Dear All,

I was cycling in the Bamburi Forest Trails yesterday (06/04/11). A small patch of the trail borders a local village, at about the 5km mark, right before the &#34;Sharp Bend&#34; sign leading straight into a dense forest section of the park; with Fig, Neem, Mango trees and other shrubbery.
Right here, after the Sharp Bend sign, there was the distinct call of a Great Sparrowhawk, well hid in the mango tree, it was calling back to the goat from the village, i stopped for a while as the accipiter seemed close, so hoping to spot it.. the a cappello went on for a while, and the sparrowhawk then went and hid in a higher neem tree, hoping to catch a glance of his suitor?? They carried on, back and forth.. Alto and Soprano.. (yikes!!)
I left them two to sing their hearts out and carried on the wet wet wet track..

Happy Birding all..
