  <pre>Greetings birders

A flock of about sixty Grey Crowned Cranes were the highlight of an outing
to Sukari Dam, Brookside Dairies, on April 22. There were still many
migrants around, including a Western Marsh Harrier, many Wood Sandpipers and
one each of Ruff and Common Greenshank, Barn Swallows flying north, a Lesser
Grey Shrike, Spotted Flycatcher and Willow Warblers.

Today, April 27, there were still Willow Warblers in Langata and Olivaceous
Warblers at the Museum. A Red-chested Cuckoo told the Wednesday Morning
Birdwalk emphatically that &#34;It will Rain!&#34;

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
