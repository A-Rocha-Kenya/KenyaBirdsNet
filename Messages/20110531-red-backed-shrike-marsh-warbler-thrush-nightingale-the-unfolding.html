Dear Kenyan Birders,
I have just updated the post - on 31 May at 0845 GMT.

Please would you care to take a look at the rather worrying Russian  
report just-in regarding an absence of Red-backed Shrikes.
It&#39;s from Konstantin Mikhailov - who has watched the River Oka for the  
past five years. The Oka is a tributary of the Volga, on the southern  
border of Moscow region.

Best of birding to you all,
James

I&#39;ve added the following note from here in Tanzania as well; please,  
any comments at all from Kenya would be most welcome (!!):

Recent ENSO/IOD Events and their effects upon East Africa

1997-1998: +IOD/El Niño [most intense ENSO event ever recorded] -  
locals say: &#34;it rained all year&#34; severe flooding across Kenya/Tanzania
1998-1999: +IOD/El Niño - some continuation of above conditions -
1999-2000:
2000-2001:
2001-2002:
2002-2003: neutral (?)/El Niño
2003-2004:
2004-2005:
2005-2006:
2006-2007:+IOD/El Niño - flooding in Tanzania; the short &#39;vuli&#39; rains  
continued from November well into the New Year of 2007
2007-2008:+IOD/La Niña [NB: the only other recorded instance of this  
combination was in 1967] - wet into April 2008 in Tz
2008-2009: neutral (?)/La Niña
2009-2010: El Niño (slight)
2010-2011: La Niña (moderate - ended in May 2011)

IOD = Indian Ocean Dipole

NB:
In the two boreal winter seasons between 2006 - and - 2008 (both were  
+IOD/El Niño events) certain species, which typically winter in  
considerable numbers only well to the south of the central plateau of  
Tanzania, e.g.
Amur Falcon, Corncrake, Red-backed Shrike and Thrush Nightingale were  
present in the Arusha area throughout the &#39;wintering&#39; season. In  
addition wintering species such as Common Swift and White-winged Black  
Tern were present in unusual abundance along the coast at Tanga.
This suggests that in wetter years some individuals of such species no  
longer &#39;feel the need&#39; to follow the ITCZ into southern Africa. That,  
in effect, they &#34;choose to fly less far to the south&#34; and presumably  
therefore they benefit considerably from such wetter seasons. Unlike  
this two past &#34;winter seasons&#34;!
