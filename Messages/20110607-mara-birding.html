  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Dear All,</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Vicki and I have recently returned to camp (25<sup>th</sup> May) after a month away in Europe, where the birding was not half as exciting as in Kenya. </font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">On 27<sup>th </sup>May, a White-fronted Bee-eater, my first in the Mara, was hanging around Naibor Camp at the same time as a small flock of White-throated BE’s came through but it didn’t seem to be associating with them. </font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Next day (28<sup>th</sup>), while running a bush breakfast on the Mara, we enjoyed a flock of 5 Horus Swift seemingly prospecting a sandbank along the Mara River, about 2.5km north of the Talek confluence, plus there were many more over the plains. Do they ever nest here?</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">On the morning of 29<sup>th</sup> May, an immature Augur Buzzard flew over camp with big numbers of vultures attending a nearby elephant carcass. This was my first around the camp area, as I usually see them in the north and east. Later that afternoon, a flock of 30+ White Stork were soaring over Ol Kiombo airstrip in thunderous weather.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">June started well with a Dwarf Bittern on 1<sup>st</sup> seen flying north from the Talek River, not far from Rekero Camp. On 2<sup>nd</sup> there was a single White Stork near Musiara Gate and many Quailfinch in that area too. A Grey-rumped Swallow near Musiara airstrip was the first I had seen in a while but all others I’ve seen so far in the Mara have been around that locality. A Eurasian Roller was at Ol Kiombo area on 2<sup>nd</sup> also.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">My first decent view of Swamp Nightjar in the Mara (despite hearing them a lot last season) was on 3<sup>rd</sup> June, close to Naibor and another nightjar around camp on 5<sup>th</sup> was probably this species also. A flock of 20+ Horus Swift hung around camp on 6<sup>th</sup> and this morning (7<sup>th</sup>) I saw my first Red-billed Quelea for Naibor next to our spa, associating with the many Village Weavers still here.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Other sightings include a pair of White-headed Vulture nesting between Ol Kiombo and Rekero Camp, with a female sitting on the nest and male perched nearby. Nubian Woodpecker have been calling around camp a lot and our resident Schalow’s Turaco, Pygmy Kingfishers, Greater Honeyguide and Hildebrandt’s Francolin are still around. Klaas’s and Diederik Cuckoo are calling alot and Jacobin have been heard calling a few times, plus Red-chested Cuckoo in camp calling much later than last year. I’ve not recorded Emerald Cuckoo yet this season. Also, no sign of Quail or Buttonquail on the Talek village run yet but I haven’t been out that way too much.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">On the breeding birds front, we currently have fledglings of Y-v Bulbul, Arrow-marked Babbler and Village Weaver in camp, plus White-browed Robin-chat feeding nestlings.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Vicki and I are heading up to Kakamega, Saiwa and Mt Elgon at the end of the month so advice on places to visit and special birds to look out for would be greatly appreciated. So far, we’re planning on 4 nights at Rondo (hopefully guided by Ben if he’s around), then 4 nights at the Barnley’s place on the recommendation of Fiona Reid, with Morris to guide. </font></span></p>
