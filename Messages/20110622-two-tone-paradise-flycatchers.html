  <pre>Greetings birders

In Gatamaiyu Forest on 19 June 2011, participants in Nature Kenya&#39;s Sunday
Birdwatch saw a male African Paradise Flycatcher near the Fisheries
campsite. Its back was rufous and its wings had a white patch as usual; but
its long central tail feathers were bright white.

Today 22 June at Rosslyn River Garden caf√© and plant nursery, Wednesday
Morning Birdwatch participants saw an African Paradise Flycatcher with a
long rufous tail. But most of the wings were white.

Well, &#34;Birds of East Africa&#34; by Terry Stevenson and John Fanshawe states:
&#34;Rufous birds with partially white wings and tail are also common.&#34;

Wishing you exciting birding, Fleur
