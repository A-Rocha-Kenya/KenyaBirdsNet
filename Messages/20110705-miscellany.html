  <pre>Nairobi Park on the 24th June there was a European Roller, we were wondering if it was going to overwinter here.
On the way to Eland Hollow there were good numbers of Zebra (now Orange-bellied) Waxbills and African Quailfinch, but difficult to get a good look at them. A Desert Cisticola perched obligingly for about 5 minutes so we could get the book out and make the identification.

This weekend on a walk / run for the Malepo Conservation near Kajiado, we had great views of a juvenile Ovampo Sparrowhawk which was hassling a female Von der Deckens Hornbill.

On the way back across the dirt road from Kajiado to Corner Baridi there was a pair of Greater Kestrel, one perched on a wire, the other chasing grasshoppers.
