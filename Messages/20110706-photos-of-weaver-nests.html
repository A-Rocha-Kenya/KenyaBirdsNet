  <pre>Hi all

You can help record weaver colonies in a global project called PHOWN
(Photos of Weaver Nests).
Anyone can browse individual records and see what has been submitted
at http://weavers.adu.org.za/phown.php. You can also see a variety of
useful summaries, showing how weaver colony sizes vary. Little data
has been published on weaver colony sizes, so this is a great way for
birders to contribute valuable data.
The basic requirements are: camera to photograph a weaver colony
(including solitary nests), gps coordinates (or google maps), and an
internet connection to upload the photos and info.
Find a weaver colony, take photos, record the coordinates and count
the nests. Ideally you should identify the weaver species, but you can
submit records of unknown species.
Useful web pages:
http://weavers.adu.org.za/phown_public.php - detailed explanation on taking part
http://weavers.adu.org.za/phown.php - see the most recent submissions
http://vmus.adu.org.za - register here and upload your photos

There are many Kenyan species and none of them have PHOWN records yet
but you can read some related breeding notes based on the recently
published Handbook of Birds of the World Vol 15 for all Ploceidae
weaver species, or browse species with PHOWN records, eg
