  Hi all,<br><br>I just received news of an amazing record of 12 Levant Sparrowhawks seen over rice fields between kakamega and kisumu on 14th November. This flock was seen by Steve Bird, leading for Zoothera Birding, and Steve has images of adults and immatures that I will forward to the group when received.<br>
<br>Also, a guest staying at Naibor in mid-November showed me images of an Osprey seen in Amboseli, taken around 8th Nov.<br><br>Vicarious records better than none!<br><br>Cheers, <br><br>Adam<br>
