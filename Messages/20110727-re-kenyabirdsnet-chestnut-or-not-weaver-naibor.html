an immature/juvenile Chestnut Weaver<br>
I think it may be a female but probably difficult to sex at that age and
stage. but also confusing the new black tail feathers coming and probably
only males posses that????????.<br>
The wing coverts are quite sharp-edged making it a young bird,<br>
moulting tail feathers too with new one being much darker and broader
than the old brown/faded and sharp tell the age.<br><br>
I think it's also the <i>only </i>true weaver (atleast fro Kenya) with no
yellow at any age or stage<br>
but to be safe i would just call it a young Chestnut Weaver <br>
May be some birdringer somewhere has caught this and can tell. Would love
to know<br>
cheers<br>

Hi Everyone,<br><br>
&nbsp;<br><br>
After several days without a trace, I saw the Chestnut Weaver at Naibor
again this morning and this time I was armed with the camera. Last time,
I was in such a hurry to fetch the camera and record the sighting that I
didnt spend as much time observing the bird as I should have, and when I
saw the bird again today, some alarm bells started ringing...<br><br>
&nbsp;<br><br>
This morning, the weaver was in the midst of 30+ Village Weaver and stood
out clearly on account of its very washed out plumage, obviously smaller
size and apparent lack of any yellow tone  at least on first impression
(see IMG_1). Once again, the buffy chest and sharp white edges to the
wings were clearly visible but this time other features seemed to
contradict the identification...<br><br>
&nbsp;<br><br>
IMG_2  shows the bird perched where it shows reddish-brown eye,
chestnut-buff chest band and some fine dark streaking at the top of the
breast. Also, the legs appear to be grey  all positive. But look at that
bi-coloured bill  the lower mandible is almost white! Is this usual for
Chestnut? There is also a yellowish tinge to the supercilium and the same
colour below the eye. <br><br>
&nbsp;<br><br>
IMG_3  shows the bird on the deck. Again the white edges to the flight
feathers are clear to see and the back feathers lack any hint of yellow
or green  they are light brown with blackish centres. However, there is
clearly a yellowish tinge to the sides of the neck  would this be
expected on Chestnut Weaver?<br><br>
&nbsp;<br><br>
IMG_4  shows the bird in comparison to a Swahili Sparrow, both of which
are clearly smaller than the Village Weaver behind. This image also shows
the yellowish tinge to the neck, cheeks and supercilium. The face of the
bird appears more like a Vitelline Masked Weaver in this image, although
the buffy chest and a little on the flanks can still be seen.<br><br>
&nbsp;<br><br>
Can the fundis please put me out of my misery  is it Chestnut Weaver or
not?<br><br>
&nbsp;<br><br>
Many thanks,<br><br>
