  <pre>Hi Adam,
I have looked at the images, but it is a real pity that it got so far
before the camera went into action. The date would suggest a
Beaudouin, the tail-banding is perfect for a Short-toed/Beaudouin but
although it is indistinct, the undertail coverts give the impression
of being pale and plain, not barred which leans more to a Short-toed.
I really would not like to put money on this. You could send the
images to Simon Thomsett on &lt;sthomsett@gmail.com&gt;
or Bill Clarke on raptours@earthlink.net, and if they canâ€™t help you no-one can.
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; Vicki and I are back from an 8-day break up-country having spent 4 nights at
&gt; Rondo Retreat, Kakamega,and 4 nights at the Barnley&#39;s near Kitale. Lots of
&gt; wonderful sightings that I&#39;ll write up soon but I just wanted to flag up the
&gt; best bird of the trip which we saw as we were heading back towards Nakuru on
&gt; 5th July - a fine Short-toed Eagle sp (looking very much like
&gt; *C.g.gallicus*but maybe more likely to be
&gt; *beaudouini* given the time of year) as we passed through the southern
&gt; section of Tindaret Forest. On locating the bird it was circling right next
&gt; to the road but by the time I had taken the camera out from the back of the
&gt; car it had soared high and far off but I still managed some shots that I am
&gt; hopeful will prove the validity of the record.
&gt;
&gt; Find terribly distant images attached (possibly the worst ever on this forum
&gt; due to the fact it was probably 1.5km away!). They are full res but only
&gt; occupy less 0.5% of the frame.
&gt;
&gt; Best,
&gt;
&gt; Adam
