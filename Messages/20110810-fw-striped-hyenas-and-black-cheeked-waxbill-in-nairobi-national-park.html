 surprised to hear of them in NNP.<br>They are so nocturnal, solitary, and silent that people consider them<br>rare, but Aaron Wagner found them to be quite common in Laikipia.<br><br>Laurence"<br><br>For some bird news, on the same day the Lhoirs also photographed a<br>couple of associating waxbills at the Hippo Pools in Nairobi National<br>Park. One is a very obvious Black-faced, the other is a very obvious<br>Black-cheeked, but not the form that occurs down Magadi Road, or<br>Tsavo, where the overall ground colour tends to resemble the kiwanukae<br>form of Black-faced (the only race we have in Kenya), but is identical<br>to the typical Black-cheeked as would be seen in Samburu or Baringo.<br>This is an incredible surprise.<br>It is of course a new species for Nairobi National Park and the entire<br>Nairobi district.<br><br>best for now<br>Brian<br><br><br></div></div></div></body></html>
