  <pre>Hi

You can upload videos of weaver colonies to YouTube and link them to a 
PHOWN record.
By linking your video clip to PHOWN, you add value to this project, and 
will obtain expert commentary on your clip.
If you already have clips of weaver colonies on YouTube, you can submit 
a PHOWN record if you have the date that the clip was taken and know the 
exact locality.

Two clips are available to see how this will work - see 
http://weavers.adu.org.za/phown_ut.php and choose to see one of the 2 clips.

To take part in this, read more here: 
http://weavers.adu.org.za/ph_help12.php

If you don&#39;t have a video camera, bookmark 
http://weavers.adu.org.za/phown_ut.php and come back later to view new 
additions.

Dieter
