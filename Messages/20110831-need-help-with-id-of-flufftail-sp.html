These pictures are not the greatest but any suggestions as to species of Flufftail this is would be appreciated. Bird is currently frozen as I plan to take it to Dept. of Ornithology at the Nairobi Museum. It was found dead at Kijabe (altitude c. 2,200 m). <br><br>Pictures don't show it very well but the throat is clearly white. Tail not strongly barred. <br><br>Much appreciated,<br><br>Jeff Davis<br> 		 	   		  </div></body>
