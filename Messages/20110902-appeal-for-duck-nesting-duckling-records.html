    A request from Graeme Cumming in Cape Town for breeding records of
    ducks &amp; geese. Part of his long-term plan is to "try to make the
    completed data set freely available on line as an appendix to a
    peer-reviewed review publication, with the major contributors as
    co-authors, so this should be a good way for people to pass their
    records on to the ornithological community for perpetuity."<br>
    <br>
    So if anyone has any records of ducks breeding, please send them to
    him to contribute to duck conservation in Africa. <br>
    <br>
    thanks<br>

    <pre>Dear all,

I am in the process of compiling existing data on the breeding patterns
of ducks (including 'geese') for sub-Saharan Africa. The goal of the
analysis is to try to connect breeding periods in different places to
movements, given that we already have several years of satellite
telemetry data for a couple of species of duck. 

We have almost completed full data entry for the SAOS data set but I
have been wondering how many additional unsubmitted nest records or
field notes are out there. If you have any additional breeding records
for Afrotropical ducks, I would be grateful if you could either submit
them formally to NERCS (copying me, if possible) or if you are short of
time, to simply pass them on to me (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:graeme.cumming@uct.ac.za">graeme.cumming@uct.ac.za</a>, cc to
<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:gscumming@gmail.com">gscumming@gmail.com</a>). I will make sure that your data are also added to
the NERCS data set. The minimum data items that I am interested in are
species, date, place (as precisely as possible), and whether you saw a
nest or ducklings. Additional information on things like numbers of
eggs, ages of ducklings and/or habitat type is also potentially useful.

The majority of our nest card information is from the 1960s-70s, so
this is also an appeal to submit new nest records - even for common
species like Egyptian Geese, we still have a relatively poor
understanding of spatial variation in the timing of breeding and exactly
how this relates to the timing of moult and movement. Tracked Egyptian
Geese may go as far as a thousand kilometres in a couple of days but
they are tied to their breeding and moulting sites for relatively long
periods of time, making these stages key influences on movement
patterns.

Best regards,

Graeme Cumming.
