  <pre>Greetings birders

Nature Kenya&#39;s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk had another outstanding morning at
the Racecourse and Ngong Road Forest Sanctuary on September 14.

Hoping to see migrants, we were surprised by the one we saw Â­ a Eurasian
Golden Oriole! Eurasian Bee-eaters were also heard faintly, in the distance,
but not seen.

Other highlights included a magnificent Crowned Eagle, a flying Ayres&#39;s Hawk
Eagle, and Spot-flanked Barbets, White-headed Barbets and Brown-backed
Woodpeckers investigating a hole in a dead tree trunk while a Lesser
Honeyguide circled around them.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
