  <pre>Good day all.

Hope that you are all well.

I would like to obtain some informtion on behalf of a friend. Two  
colleagues of mine are flying to Kenya from S. Africa, with a view of  
doing some birding in Tanzania (my wife and I would have LOVED to join  
them, but we will be expecting our first child around then.) They will  
targetting 3 main birding locations: East Usambara Mts, Amani Mt  
Reserve, Uluguru.

There are three main questions that I would appreciate input on:

-Does anyone know of recommended local guides who can help in any of  
the three locations?
-Lastly, what birder-friendly accomodation exists in any of these  
three areas?
-Are there any mp3s of East African bird calls? They are looking  
particularly for the ones for the Tanzanian birds.

Any input will be highly appreciated.

Kind regards,
Felix
