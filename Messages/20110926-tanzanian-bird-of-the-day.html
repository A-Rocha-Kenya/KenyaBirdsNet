  <pre>Hi all,

I&#39;m still publishing the &#34;birds of the day&#34;, we are now at 17... I don&#39;t announce them daily as they are not taken in Kenya, but up to now the 17 species are seen in Kenya too.

The page listing them is here
http://www.valeryschollaert.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1114&amp;Itemid=387


The last ones are
Red-backed Mannikin
Common Fiscal
Black-headed Oriole
Hamerkop
...

Enjoy!

Val√©ry
