 who might have strange looking Rollers at the Mara.</div><div>Itai</div><div><br></div><div>Here are comments from Don, Colin and Brian:</div><div><br></div><div>Hi Itai,<br></div><div>I am still on safari, but tonight on wi-fi. Your roller is absolutely</div><div>astounding. The bird looks small, the bill is slight, the extensive</div><div>white forehead and forecrown, broad white eye brow, the contrasting</div><div>black line from side of nape to and through eye, complete lack of</div><div>visible blue on wing, brown of back extending as same colour to back</div><div>of nape and neck, all blue underparts, I can see no reason why this is</div><div>not a blue form of Racquet-tailed Roller regardless of the lack of</div><div>racquets!</div><div>Exactly where was this? Are there any more images!</div><div>Best for now</div><div>Brian</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Itai - a beautiful shot of a lovely bird - and as Don says, quite a mystery. I
 wonder if any other images of the bird from different angles would reveal any other features? The blue underparts certainly don't resemble Lilac-breasted - far too rich. A real beaut of a bird... Would be good to have it seen and photographed some more. You say you think you've seen birds like this before in Mara? In the same area that this bird was found? All very interesting...</div><div>Colin</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>An amazing image. &nbsp; &nbsp;I don't think there is any Lilac-breasted R. in this bird. &nbsp;Its odd that the wings appear not to show any violet or blue. &nbsp; &nbsp;Head and underparts resemble the nominate form of Racquet-tailed, but not the upperparts &nbsp;so there is clearly a mix, but of what ?</div><div><br></div><div>What date was this photo taken, and roughly where in the Mara. &nbsp;Any other rollers nearby ?</div><div><br></div><div>In the past there have been a few odd-looking Abyssinian as far south as
 the Mara and northern Serengeti that have become lost individuals. If they did hybridize with Lilac-breasted would the underparts be as rich a blue as this bird ?</div><div><br></div><div>Total mystery, lets hope it gets donated to science.</div><div>Don</div><div>--</div></span></div><div style="font-family: 'times new roman', 'new york', times, serif; font-size: 12pt; ">&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: 'times new roman', 'new york', times, serif; font-size: 12pt; ">I'd rather go birding...<br>***************************************<br>Itai Shanni                 <br>Eilat &amp; Arave Region Coordinator, <br>Israel Ornithological Centre (BirdLife partner in Israel)<br>Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel (SPNI) <br><a rel="nofollow">iocitai@inter.net.il</a>,&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow">itaisha1@yahoo.com</a><br>MOBILE: +972-523-689773<br>TELEFAX: +972-77-9300173 <br><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank"
