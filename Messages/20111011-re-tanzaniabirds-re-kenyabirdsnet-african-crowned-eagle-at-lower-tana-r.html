  River<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt; 
  Dear All,<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;Dr. Julie Wieczkowski recovered the skull of 
  an adult<BR>&gt; male&nbsp;Tana River Mangabey in Mcheleo Forest, lower Tana 
  River, in<BR>&gt; 2006.&nbsp; The punctures in the skull make us&nbsp;strongly 
  suspect that this<BR>&gt; monkey was was killed by an African Crowned 
  Eagle.&nbsp; We have drafted a note<BR>&gt; on this finding.&nbsp; Here is 
  what the draft now says about the occurrence of<BR>&gt; the African Crowned 
  Eagle along the lower Tana River.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;Crowned eagles at the 
  lower Tana River<BR>&gt;&gt;Crowned<BR>&gt; eagles are present in the forests 
  of the lower Tana River (Andrews et al.,<BR>&gt; 1975;<BR>&gt; Lewis and 
  Pomeroy, 1989; Zimmerman et al., 1999; D.N.M. Mbora, pers. comm.).<BR>&gt; 
  They are, however, uncommon; there are few observations of crowned 
  eagles,<BR>&gt; no<BR>&gt; nests have been confirmed, and none of the current 
  researchers have heard<BR>&gt; the<BR>&gt; far-carrying, distinctive, 
  prolonged display call during many years of<BR>&gt; research<BR>&gt; in these 
  forests (D.N.M. Mbora, pers. comm.; T.M. Butynski and J.<BR>&gt; 
  Wieczkowski,<BR>&gt; pers. obs.).<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;I write this to ask 
  whether any of the readers have seen or<BR>&gt; heard the African Crowned 
  Eagle in the forests of the lower Tana<BR>&gt; River....either<BR>&gt; in the 
  distant past or recently.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;Monkeys remain extremely 
  abundant in these forests....and<BR>&gt; other prey of the Crowned Eagle 
  (e.g.,&nbsp;dik-dik) are also present.&nbsp; The<BR>&gt; current absence, or 
  very low density, of Crowned Eagles in the forests of<BR>&gt; the<BR>&gt; 
  lower Tana River&nbsp;is difficult to explain, although my own impression 
  is<BR>&gt; that, for whatever reason,&nbsp;the Crowned Eagle&nbsp;is more a 
  bird of<BR>&gt; mid-altitude and montane forest than of lowland / coastal 
  forest.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;Any comments are 
  appreciated!<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;Best
