  <pre>Greetings birders

An outstanding Wednesday Morning Birdwalk today on the Museum grounds and
the new City Council park along the Nairobi River.

Highlights include a pair of Lanner Falcon at their nest; five African Black
Ducks on the river Â­ presumably a pair and their grown young;
Cinnamon-chested Bee-eaters at arm&#39;s length; and a fall of Willow Warblers.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
