<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Nice photos you took. The female puffback photo you took doesn't show a whitish loral spot. A female Pringle's would show a whitish loral spot or it could be a imm or juv, but i can't tell. The other photo, i don't think it is a Whydah as it does not show a supercillium as most females or juv would show or i could be wrong.&nbsp;The head colour looks more brown to me, the body&nbsp;size is quit small more like those&nbsp;in finchs family.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Keep an eye on it, if it does turn up again at the birdbath in a different stage.</DIV>

<DIV>I found the following bird (attached photo) which appears to be a Pringle's. I got a photo of the female but I didn't get the male.&nbsp; Anyway, I would love to hear if I got this wrong or, if it is a Pringle's where the closest known population is to here in East Laikipia. We are at over 1600 meters and the books say Pringle's only go up to 1200 meters.<BR><BR>A few other bird observations that we have had is:<BR><BR>Lizard Buzzard (about a week ago on the Ewaso Nyiro River across from Mpala)<BR><BR>Alpine Swift (2 months back with some mottled swifts above our offices)<BR><BR>Lastly, I have attached a bird that I can't seem to recognize. It has been coming to our birdbath and I feel like it is something common but wearing a plumage I'm just not recognizing. Whydah ? Thanks for any ideas. <BR clear=all><BR>-- <BR>James Christian<BR>Karisia Walking Safaris<BR><A href="http://www.karisia.com/" target=_blank
