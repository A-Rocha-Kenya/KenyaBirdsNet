  <pre>Dear All,
I arrived at the Main Entrance of NNP at 6.15am and was through the gate soon after. There had been some light drizzle during the night, but nothing much except to dampen the roads. 
I first visited the KWS Mess garden, where there was a Common Buzzard, single Tree Pipit, the first returning Nightingale, four Willow Warblers, a couple of Garden Warblers and a Blackcap. By contrast the Ivory Burning Site could only produce a single Nightingale, and there was another very showy bird on the back road to Hyena Dam. Here there were also three Wood and a Green Sandpiper, and a bold pair of African Water Rails. The first returning Lesser Striped Swallow was also here, but the only individual seen today. At the dam there was the immature Purple Heron, African Jacana, more Water Rails calling, and the first of six Whinchats seen today.
On the run-off area were the pair of Saddle-billed Storks, five Spur-winged Geese, a good number for the Park, a Eurasian Marsh Harrier went over without stopping, a couple of Rosy-breasted Longclaws, a number of feeding Barn Swallows, three more Whinchats, and all three Widowbirds with Jackson&#39;s displaying. Circling back round to Nagalomon Dam there were thirty Eurasian Bee-eaters along the Mokoyiet, whilst the dam was unusually productive with an adult male, female and immature Darters, fifteen Black-crowned Night-Herons, a Swamphen, sub-adult Purple Heron, the Parks third only Water Thick-knee (and first away from Athi Dam), and a few Wood and Green Sandpipers. There was a Fan-tailed Grassbird calling in the grassland opposite. 
The circuit around to Eland Hollow and KPS Dams was quite fruitless apart from three Shelley&#39;s Francolins, pairs of Red-billed Teal resting on the banks, the only Common Sandpiper of the day and a single Sand Martin hawking with the Barn Swallows. There were one each Northern and Isabelline Wheatears towards Kingfisher, the only Wheatears seen today, a Brown-backed Woodpecker in the Forest, where there were also a Common Buzzard, and a couple each of Blackcap and Garden Warblers.
I departed though Langata Gate at 3.00pm.

A pleasant enough day, surprisingly quiet for migrants and more interesting for local water associated birds.
Mammals were also quiet, there seemed to have been quite an exodus from the northern parts of the Park. There were three Suni at the KWS Mess, two Hippos at Hyena and four at Nagalomon Dams but little else of note.

Best to All
Brian
