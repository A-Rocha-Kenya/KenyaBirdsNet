  Hi All,<br><br>As I write this little update, we have Emerald Cuckoo and Schalow&#39;s Turaco competing for volume outside the office. <br><br>An African Cuckoo was calling in camp on 18th and showed well, and we&#39;ve had a pair of Black-and-white Casqued Hornbill in camp for much of this month.<br>

<br>Star birds for me this month were three Black-and-white Mannakin that fed just outside the office yesterday. This was my best view of the <i>poensis</i> race and was surprised at the &quot;brown-ness&quot; of the mantle. Fanshawe and Stevenson make the point that this subspecies (or maybe a full species now?) is entirely black and white with no contrast between the head and the mantle, while Zimmerman, Turner and Pearson get it right by stating that this subspecies shows a dark brown back. Check out the image attached for a better idea of this colour. <br>

<br>Wishing you all a fabulous Christmas and a bird-rich New Year,<br><br>Warmest regards from the Mara,<br><br>Adam &amp; Vicki <br>Naibor Camp<br><br>Â  <br><br>
