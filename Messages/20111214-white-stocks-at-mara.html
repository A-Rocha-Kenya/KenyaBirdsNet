  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" ><tr><td valign="top" style="font: inherit;">Hello birders<br><br>On 7th and 8th of this Month 4 kilometer from Mara Fig tree Camp at Masaai Mara game reserve a flock of 70+ White stock&nbsp; were busy feeding on the ground.<br><br>Other&nbsp; interesting bird were: Taita fiscal (Loita Plains),Montagu's Harrier flying or over the open grassland,A good number of&nbsp; Flappet,Red capped ,Rufous napped&nbsp; Lark.Two of the Longclaw Rosy breasted and Yellow Throated.Grassland and Tree Pipit.Along the Loita plains i spoted the Abdim's stork.<br><br>The mojor challenge was on the Raptor like African Harrier seated in 
middle of of the road but when it flew i managed to see white rump which
 brought the confusion.<br><br>&nbsp;The Jackson's Widowbird displaying jumping up and down and not fur from there where the Fan-tailed Widowbirds were and therefore they completely mixed me and i started to wonder if they are Jackson's Widowbirds without the fully breeding plumage and the long tail. Please if any one know about those Widowbirds can be of great&nbsp; help. Though when leaving Mara i Spoted Yellow-Mantled Widowbird collecting the nesting material.<br><br>I kindly request if anyone can be able to help it will be highly appreciated.<br><br>Wish you all a merry X-mas and prosperous 2012 birding<br><br>George<br><br></td></tr></table>
