  Hi All,<br><br>Having recorded a small party of Horus Swift apparently prospecting for nest holes along the Mara River a few weeks ago, I&#39;ve been equally surprised at the numbers gathering around Naibor over the past week or so.<br>
<br>This morning I took a walk with an askari upstream from Naibor, along the Talek River, and was amazed to see a flock of 40-50 birds wheeling around a tall bank which certainly looked like they would be nesting there. So, 20-25 pairs maybe ... does anyone have records supporting breeding in this area previously? During the same period last year, I recorded no sightings of Horus Swift at all.<br>
<br>Most literature suggests they tend occur where White-fronted Bee-eaters breed but with the exception of a single in camp last month I have not recorded them in this part of the Mara before. I gather they are more regular in the NW of the reserve though.<br>
<br>Any thoughts and comments warmly welcomed.<br><br>Other notes from camp; a pair of Swahili Sparrow are nesting above the mess so a May egg month for anyone interested in the data. White-browed Robin-chat have one chubby fledgling in camp, and the Yellow-spotted Petronia pair seem to be preparing the Giraffe skull for a nest hole for the second time.<br>
<br>Very best,<br><br>Adam<br><br>Â <br><div style="visibility: hidden; left: -5000px; position: absolute; z-index: 9999; padding: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px; overflow: hidden; word-wrap: break-word; color: black; font-size: 10px; text-align: left; line-height: 130%;" id="avg_ls_inline_popup">
