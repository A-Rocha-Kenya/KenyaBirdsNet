  <pre>Hi,

A nightjar got trapped last night in our house in Kitengela and we noticed this morning. I have managed a bunch of photos in an attempt to calm the highly stressed bird and it is still here and am planning to release it at night which I hope is the right thing.

However an id would be useful at is looks like a Nubian but am not sure.How do I get the photos to you?

My regards

Ikawa
