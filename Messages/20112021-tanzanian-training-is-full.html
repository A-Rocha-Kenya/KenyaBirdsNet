  <pre>Hi all,

Just a little message to ask you to stop subscribing to Bird-in-Tuition - MamboViewPoint 2011 training. We are full. Two of the 12 students are from Kenya!

We will quickly offer a new one, probably during first half of 2012, as you seem numerous to be interested. 

Thank you and happy birding!

Val√©ry
