  <pre>Hi Adam,
Breeding is regular in Plain Martin holes along the Mara, and we also
had them nest in Kichwa once when there was habitat along the
Sabaringo. June-July is the time when they breed in the Mara. In the
Kedong and Nakuru they breed in White-fronted Bee-eater holes.Best for
now
Brian

&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; Having recorded a small party of Horus Swift apparently prospecting for nest
&gt; holes along the Mara River a few weeks ago, I&#39;ve been equally surprised at
&gt; the numbers gathering around Naibor over the past week or so.
&gt;
&gt; This morning I took a walk with an askari upstream from Naibor, along the
&gt; Talek River, and was amazed to see a flock of 40-50 birds wheeling around a
&gt; tall bank which certainly looked like they would be nesting there. So, 20-25
&gt; pairs maybe ... does anyone have records supporting breeding in this area
&gt; previously? During the same period last year, I recorded no sightings of
&gt; Horus Swift at all.
&gt;
&gt; Most literature suggests they tend occur where White-fronted Bee-eaters
&gt; breed but with the exception of a single in camp last month I have not
&gt; recorded them in this part of the Mara before. I gather they are more
&gt; regular in the NW of the reserve though.
&gt;
&gt; Any thoughts and comments warmly welcomed.
&gt;
&gt; Other notes from camp; a pair of Swahili Sparrow are nesting above the mess
&gt; so a May egg month for anyone interested in the data. White-browed
&gt; Robin-chat have one chubby fledgling in camp, and the Yellow-spotted
&gt; Petronia pair seem to be preparing the Giraffe skull for a nest hole for the
&gt; second time.
&gt;
&gt; Very best,
&gt;
&gt; Adam
