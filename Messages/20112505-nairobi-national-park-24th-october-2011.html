  <pre>Dear All,
Mike Davidson kindly provided transport and his company, for Fleur Ng&#39;Weno and myself, for a day in NNP.

We met up at the Main Entrance at 6.20am, and were soon through the gate. There had been some showers overnight, and several Willow Warblers were singing their approvals in the car-park.
There were a couple of Common Buzzards on the drive in, and a look at the KWS Mess gardens was not rewarding, likewise the Ivory Burning Site was quiet with no migrants to be seen, although the four Chestnut Weavers are certainly not resident. Along the back road we found little to whet the appetite until Hyena Dam. Here there were an African Water Rail, a pair of Swamphen but no chick, ten Wood and three Green Sandpipers. At the run-off were a new family of 30 Ostrich chicks, two each of Yellow-billed and Great Egrets, a pair of Saddle-billed Stork, two Pallid and one Montagu&#39;s Harriers, a Fish Eagle, the first of four Whinchats, two Yellow Wagtails and a couple of Rosy-breasted Longclaws. Towards Karen PS Dam we found ten Black-winged Plovers and a couple of White-tailed Larks, and Eland Hollow held the pair of Black-winged Stilts, ten Wood and four Green Sandpipers and two Common Sandpipers. A few Barn Swallows were coming in to drink, and with them was a Sand Martin. Lesser Striped Swallow were not seen today, nor are they expected for the next few weeks as they are on their mysterious six weeks vacation from Nairobi, like every other year. Athi Dam provided little, but there was a Glossy Ibis, as well as the usual pair of Spur-winged Plovers, ten Little Stints, and a few sandpipers and Greenshank. Along the Mbagathi River near Cheetah Gate was an Open-billed Stork, an out-of-plumaged Cardinal Quelea with Red-billed Quelea and a few Crimson-rumped Waxbills. 
It was then quiet and desolately dry, all around to Kingfisher, where there were our only Northern and Isabelline Wheatears of the day, and three parties totalling twenty-eight Grey-headed Silverbills. At Nagalomon Dam on our way out was a pair of Darters and four Black-crowned Night-Herons, and over the forest one each of dark and light-phased Booted Eagles, and a Steppe Eagle.

Because for Nairobi NP, it was a bit on the quiet side, we departed through the Main Gate at 3.00pm.

Mammals were as usual in numbers between Karen PS Dam and Athi Dam, in spite of the rains in the north, there is little evidence of any greening in the south.

Best for now
Brian
