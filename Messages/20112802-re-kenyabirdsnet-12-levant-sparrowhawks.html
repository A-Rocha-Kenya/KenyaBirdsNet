  <pre>Hi Adam,
That&#39;s really weird, I heard from Steven Easley that twelve were seen
passing with Honey Buzzards in the Kerio at the same period seen by
David Wolfe from Vent!
Ahero Rice fields is exactly where David Fisher and Edwin Selempo had
about twenty a few Januarys ago. Will look forward to the images.
Best for now
Brian

PS get over to the grasslands, Oloololo Gate as far as Serena, the
Black-backed Cisticolas are on show again! About twenty Rufous-bellied
Herons are about to nest in the Little Governors swamp.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I just received news of an amazing record of 12 Levant Sparrowhawks seen
&gt; over rice fields between kakamega and kisumu on 14th November. This flock
&gt; was seen by Steve Bird, leading for Zoothera Birding, and Steve has images
&gt; of adults and immatures that I will forward to the group when received.
&gt;
&gt; Also, a guest staying at Naibor in mid-November showed me images of an
&gt; Osprey seen in Amboseli, taken around 8th Nov.
&gt;
&gt; Vicarious records better than none!
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;
&gt; Adam
