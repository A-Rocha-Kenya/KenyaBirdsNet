<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Over the weekend of 5-6 Feb 2011, I was lucky to be among team of waterbird counters heading of to Lake Olborossat, Nyandarua. We camped at the KWS station in Manguo, a km away from Thomson Falls and adjacent to Marmanet Forest.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>On the evening of 5th, a group of us decided to take a brief walk into the forest, and within a really short time, we had managed to see almost 30 bird species, including really good views of Narina Trogon, Hartlaub's Turaco, White-tailed Crested Flycatcher, Blackcap, Abyssinian Crimsonwing, Brown-crowned&nbsp;Tchagra, Yellow-whiskered Greenbul,&nbsp;Fine-banded Woodpecker, Montane White-eye.......and of course very fresh signs of existence of elephants in the forest. At night, calls of tree hyrax filled the really cold night.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>During the waterbird counts on 6th, the section my team covered didn't let down: the highlight was a pair of <STRONG>Collared Pratincoles (attached photo);</STRONG> Thousands of Red-knobbed Coots; hundreds of Hotentot Teals, Red-billed Teals,&nbsp;Northern Shovelers, a Saddle-billed Stork,&nbsp;many waders etc. However, the duck&nbsp;shooters who have been visiting the site since my childhood (I was born not too far &nbsp;from site and have heard shots since those days) were around proceeding with their sport - with their dogs and boats.............</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I observe the warmth and excellent help we received from hosts: KWS, Nyahururu Bird Club, the Municipal among others. For birding in these areas, you may get in touch with Nyahururu Bird Club members -&nbsp; Peter Karani, George Ndungu (<FONT face=Tahoma><A href="mailto:georgendungu2008@yahoo.com" rel=nofollow target=_blank ymailto="mailto:georgendungu2008@yahoo.com"><FONT color=#0000ff>georgendungu2008@yahoo.com</FONT></A>; <FONT face="Times New Roman">0723550552</FONT>) and Amina Njoki (<A href="mailto:aminanjoki@ymail.com" rel=nofollow target=_blank ymailto="mailto:aminanjoki@ymail.com"><FONT color=#0000ff>aminanjoki@ymail.com</FONT></A>; <FONT face="Times New Roman">0727873090</FONT>)</FONT></DIV>
