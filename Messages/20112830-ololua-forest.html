  <pre>Karen Plumbe and I had a lovely walk in Ololua Forest last week, Wednesday. Walking along by the river we caught two feeding parties almost at eye level and had great views of Slender-billed Greenbul, Black-backed Puff Back,Hartlaub&#39;s Turacos, Brown-backed Woodpecker and Northern Double-collared Sunbird. An African Goshawk, alighted infront of us twice and we heard but didn&#39;t see, Grey Olive Greenbuls down in the thickets near the river. In the undergrowth were Cabanis Greenbuls and White-starred Robin. We were very concerned to see the huge pipes which are being placed to take Mbagathi River Water to Karen Golf Club. Full list is in kenyabirdfinder http://www.worldbirds.org
