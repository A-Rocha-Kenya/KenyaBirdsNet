  <pre>Hi All,

Had a great drive to the Lookout Hill area yesterday morning. At Irish
Bridge I found a very approachable immature Purple Heron, my first in
the reserve, and next to the Mara River, a flock of 9 Senegal Plover
which are my first sight observations (I occasionally hear them call
at night when they&#39;re on the move). As the guide books suggest, no
doubt these birds arrived with the rains which have begun in earnest
here now. See pics attached. Also, European Roller close to Mara
River.

I visited last year&#39;s nesting site of Rufous-tailed Weaver and
although no birds were present, there were some relatively fresh nests
close by last year&#39;s tree. I&#39;ll keep checking and hope that they
return.

All the best,
