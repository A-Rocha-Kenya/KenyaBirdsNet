  <hr/>
  <pre>We were excited about spending 4 days camping - an hour and a half northwest of Baringo, but it was a real disappointment!
It had rained, everything was green, some acacias were in flower but we only had a few Violet-backed and Beautiful Sunbirds.We were in a swamp, with some standing water, but the only birds to visit were Hammerkop, a Striated Heron and a female Knob-billed Duck. There were 7 species of doves/pigeons, a Brown Snake Eagle and of the more northern species we had just Jackson&#39;s Hornbill and Northern Brownbul. Numbers were also very low and what we saw hid quickly. Hard to explain! The highlight of the trip was a Pearl-spotted Owlet who sat in a small, bare, dead tree in front of us one hot afternoon.
