  <hr/>
  Hi All,<br><br>Yesterday evening, a flock of 23 White-throated Bee-eaters drifted over camp and there are numerous small groups of European Bee-eaters still passing through. <br><br>At lunch-time, a flock of 150+ White Storks drifted south, high over camp and on 18th the Black Stork was seen again close to Naibor. A ghostly pale Pallid Harrier drifted around camp on 18th also.<br>
<br>Cuckoos have been calling madly in camp over this past week, starting off with an Emerald Cuckoo on 18th, Red-chested Cuckoo on 19th (and daily since) and Diederik this morning (23rd), plus our resident Klaas&#39;s daily too.<br>
<br>Up to five Lesser Honeyguides in the camp a possible Pallid too.<br><br>Steppe Eagles have been loitering around camp for a week but I&#39;m yet to see Lesser Spotted here this season so far.<br><br>All the best,<br><br>
