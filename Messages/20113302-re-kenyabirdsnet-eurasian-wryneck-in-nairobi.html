  <pre>Wow, have you ever thought of getting your garden elevated to
Observatory Status!

&gt; Stayed home to work at my computer today and was rewarded by a Eurasian
&gt; Wryneck in the bush outside my window! Pale buffy throat with fine barring
&gt; clearly seen. What a surprise!
&gt;
&gt; At Olorgesailie on Nov 20 with Nature Kenya&#39;s Sunday Birdwatch,
&gt; Yellow-spotted Petronias were calling and displaying, flashing their
&gt; seldom-seen yellow throat patch.
&gt;
&gt; Wishing you good birding, Fleur
