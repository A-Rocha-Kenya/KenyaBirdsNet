  <pre>Greetings birders

Nature Kenya&#39;s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk had splendid views of an African
Cuckoo Hawk fledged immature begging from an adult on March 2. This was in
the wooded gardens at the end of Loresho Ridge near the University of
Nairobi&#39;s Field Station.

Some years ago the Birdwalk participants had also recorded adult and
immature African Cuckoo Hawk at this locality. It appears to be a regular
breeding site. Migrants such as Barn Swallow, Pied Wheatear, Blackcap and
Tree Pipit were also seen on March 2.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
