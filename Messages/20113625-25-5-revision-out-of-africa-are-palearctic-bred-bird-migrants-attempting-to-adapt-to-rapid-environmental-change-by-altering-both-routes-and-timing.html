In brief, in September, just at the end of the rainy season, when the passrines come down from Europe, the Sahel is a green shore to the Sahara.&nbsp; In April, when they move back north, at the end of the dry season, the Sahel is an extension of the Sahara, EVERY year.&nbsp;&nbsp;In April, David, who lives in Niger not far from Lake Chad,&nbsp;picks up Redstarts, White-throats etc. that are heat struck before they even start to cross the Sahara.&nbsp; Some pictures of heat struck birds have just been put on the blingual (English and French) Niger Bird DataBase site,<a href="http://www.bromus.net/nibdab">www.bromus.net/nibdab</a>&nbsp;(click on Photos and sort on order of entry).</div><div>Joost Brouwer</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>*****************************************************************************</div><div><div><b>Uganda:</b></div><div>A few bits of information which are probably not much use to your study, being the wrong side of the Rift Valley.</div><div>Had an entertaining few days in Kidepo Valley Nat Park 25-27 April this year and saw good numbers of Shrikes, approx 120 Lesser Grey, 60+ Red-backed and 50+ Isabelline.&nbsp;</div><div>Also seen at least ten Red-backed and 8 Isabelline in Kampala last autumn and this spring.

This is well to the west of the Rift Valley and these birds were present in drought conditions, almost unprecedented there.&nbsp;The Tanzanian shores of the Lake Victoria basin e.g including the western corridor of the Serengeti NP and Speke Bay were exceptionally dry up until March 20/21, when they received 65 mm in one night at SB Lodge.</div><div><br></div><div>It seems likely it was not until mid-April that the first real wave of shrikes came through the coastal strip at Tanga area (just south of Kenya border) during plentiful rainfall there.</div><div>These long-heavy rains seem to have arrived, and be lingering, later this season and so maybe many Palearctic migrants have likewise been forced, fat-wise, to delay their departure.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br></div><div>In April I travelled on a rapid transect across the entire shrike route (flight path).&nbsp;</div><div>Firstly from Arusha west to Lake Victoria back to Arusha and then from Arusha to Ushongo, Pangani and back - Pangani is on the East African coast just south of the Kenya/Tz border.</div><div>We went down to the coast on April 17 along the main NBI-Dar road passing Mount Meru, Kilimanjaro, Same, Segera and Muheza (East Usambaras).</div><div><br></div><div>There were no migrant shrikes visible on the way east to the coast even though [unusually] we had seen many, our first ones, at Ndutu&nbsp;(>30) way out&nbsp;in the steppes at the western Ngorongoro CAA/Serengeti NP boundary on April 15/16.&nbsp;The complete absence of RBS along the main highway on April 17 was a remarkable and disturbing fact, as 'usually' there are scores and scores along this roadside by mid-April.</div><div><br></div><div>Early in the next week, at the Indian Ocean coastline, we had three significant rain storms, especially on 18/19, during which there were falls of both shrikes and also Spotted Flycatchers&nbsp;</div><div>We returned west on the same route during April 18/19/20 via a stop-over near Nyumba ya Mungu reservoir o/n on 19th.&nbsp;</div><div>On the slower return trip westwards, inland through good shrike habitat (April 25-28), we saw a small number of female Red-backed Shrikes but, by now, very few males.</div><div><br></div><div>Red-backed Shrikes, especially males who presumably usually come through first, appeared to be in lower numbers and definitely peaked over a week late.&nbsp;</div><div>They were much very concentrated in those areas where there had been recent heavy yet isolated showers, these were chiefly west and east of their normal flyway. Especially, and perhaps somewhat unusually, west of the Rift at Ndutu, and east right along the coast south of Pangani.&nbsp;</div><div>There were very few birds in much of the central 200km wide part of their 'normal flyway route' on April 17.&nbsp;</div><div>This northbound route is through the savannas of eastern Tz between Kilimanjaro and the coastal strip&nbsp;i.e. just south of Amboseli and the two Tsavo parks in Kenya.&nbsp;</div><div>James Wolstencroft</div></div><div><br></div><div>**********************************************************************************</div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold; ">RSA:</span></div><div>At Nylsvley Nature Reserve in northern South Africa, Red-backed Shrike is a common summer visitor to this semi-arid savanna.&nbsp;</div><div><div><font>Annual bird counts are done&nbsp;across the 4000 ha reserve&nbsp;each year (2000-2011 so far) in the last week of January (18 standard transects in acacia and broad-leafed woodland, each team walking from 06h00 for 2 hours counting all birds encountered).
