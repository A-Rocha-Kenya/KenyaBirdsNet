The first is a Racquet-tail from Kilosa.<br>This is a blue form,&nbsp; there was a discussion about the actual<br>existence of “races” some time back. The usual form I have seen around<br>Kilosa is pink-breasted. I cannot imagine a different race wandering<br>into anothers range, but there is an actual existence of “races”<br>“weigallii” or “spatulatus”
 isn’t the issue here.<br><br>The second image is an Abyssinian Roller from Lokichogio, without its<br>tail streamers.<br><br>I completely agree with Adam, even to the spelling of racquet!<br><br>In a previous email to Itai, after the image was sent to me I gave a<br>list of reasons why I would like to see this bird submitted to the<br>rarities committee as the first Racquet-tailed Roller for Kenya. They<br>were “…The bird looks small, the bill is slight, the extensive white<br>forehead and forecrown, broad white eye brow, the contrasting black<br>line from side of nape to and through eye, complete lack of visible<br>blue on wing, brown of back extending as same colour to back of nape<br>and neck, all blue underparts, I can see no reason why this is not a<br>blue form of Racquet-tailed Roller regardless of the lack of<br>racquets!”<br><br>Unlike any other eastern blue roller, RTR is the only species that<br>completely lacks pale blue on the
 closed wing, as with Adams image, my<br>Kilosa image and the Mara image, all showing brown/ deep blue,<br>shoulders and coverts. I know very little about genetics, but surely<br>no hybridisation between Lilac-breasted, Eurasian or Abyssinian is<br>going to throw brown coverts into the mix and change the extensive<br>silver blue areas to deep blue.<br><br>Lilac-breasted and Abyssinian show blue on outer and many inner<br>retrices, again any hybridisation should surely result in a<br>continuation of the blue, not create random dark tail feathers.<br>Racquet-tailed has reduced pale blue in the tail. Uniquely amongst the<br>group in EA, all the tail feathers are broadly dark tipped. The only<br>pale blue in the tail of RTR is restricted to the bases of a few sets<br>of outer retrices. On a perched bird with the central feathers<br>covering much of the outer ones, hardly any pale blue would be visible<br>if at all. There is no pale blue visible on the tail
 in the image of<br>the Mara bird. Refer to the image of the moulting Abyssinian and the<br>amount of blue still visible even with the outer retrices missing.<br>Also note that the amount of pale blue visible on the closed wing of<br>this bird that is so extensive that it completely hides the underparts<br>in case you think it is the belly you see.<br><br>Colin (B) mentions the large amount of white on the forehead as a<br>support for Abyssinian. RTR does show the forehead whitish, and this<br>streaks back broadly above the eye, contrasting with the black line<br>from lores through the eye adjoining the nape that is concolorous with<br>the back. Abyssinian shows white forehead as well, however this white<br>band stops above the eye as a narrow semicircle, behind this the head<br>is all blue. It shows dark lores, which extend beyond the eye and stop<br>abruptly before reaching beyond the side of the face, not sweeping<br>back to and joining the nape,
 which of course is entirely blue in<br>Abyssinian, again as with Adams image, my Kilosa image and the Mara<br>image, and Adam and my Abyssinian images from both sides of the<br>continent, these features are evident.<br><br>I think you can see what horse I am backing, however in view of the<br>unlikelihood of a Racquet-tailed Roller ever turning up in the Mara,<br>and being found in what must be croton scrub, I would really<br>appreciate conclusive evidence that show that this is not a RTR that<br>has done exactly that!<br><br>Best to all<br>Brian<br><br>Images under another email, as cannot attach to this thread.<br><br><br>On 10/11/11, Colin Beale &lt;<a ymailto="mailto:cb751@york.ac.uk" href="mailto:cb751@york.ac.uk">cb751@york.ac.uk</a>&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; I'm interested in this - it's a lovely bird!

 looking for?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; C<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On 11/10/2011 09:24, Itai Shanni wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; [Attachment(s) &lt;#TopText&gt; from Itai Shanni included below]<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Dear all,<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; an Israeli Photographer, Eyal Bar-tov has recently came back from<br>&gt;&gt; leading a tour in Kenya where he photographed on the 14/08/2011 at 09:50<br>&gt;&gt; between Keekorok and the Mara River the attached Roller photo.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; When i saw the photo i remembered seeing strange pale looking Roller in<br>&gt;&gt; the area between Sekenani and Talek, (not far from Simba Lodge) while<br>&gt;&gt; guiding a general wildlife group back in Aug 2004. at the time i<br>&gt;&gt; dismissed it as a probable Abyssinian, but never thought about<br>&gt;&gt; Racket-tailed...<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; This new bird looks very good for a Racquet-tailed Roller, though the<br>&gt;&gt; closest record for the species is about 1300 km to the
 south (Neil<br>&gt;&gt; please correct me if i'm wrong).<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; It will be great to have more records from others who might have strange<br>&gt;&gt; looking Rollers at the Mara.<br>&gt;&gt; Itai<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Here are comments from Don, Colin and Brian:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Hi Itai,<br>&gt;&gt; I am still on safari, but tonight on wi-fi. Your roller is absolutely<br>&gt;&gt; astounding. The bird looks small, the bill is slight, the extensive<br>&gt;&gt; white forehead and forecrown, broad white eye brow, the contrasting<br>&gt;&gt; black line from side of nape to and through eye, complete lack of<br>&gt;&gt; visible blue on wing, brown of back extending as same colour to back<br>&gt;&gt; of nape and neck, all blue underparts, I can see no reason why this is<br>&gt;&gt; not a blue form of Racquet-tailed Roller regardless of the lack of<br>&gt;&gt; racquets!<br>&gt;&gt; Exactly where was this? Are there any more
 images!<br>&gt;&gt; Best for now<br>&gt;&gt; Brian<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Itai - a beautiful shot of a lovely bird - and as Don says, quite a<br>&gt;&gt; mystery. I wonder if any other images of the bird from different angles<br>&gt;&gt; would reveal any other features? The blue underparts certainly don't<br>&gt;&gt; resemble Lilac-breasted - far too rich. A real beaut of a bird... Would<br>&gt;&gt; be good to have it seen and photographed some more. You say you think<br>&gt;&gt; you've seen birds like this before in Mara? In the same area that this<br>&gt;&gt; bird was found? All very interesting...<br>&gt;&gt; Colin<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; An amazing image. I don't think there is any Lilac-breasted R. in this<br>&gt;&gt; bird. Its odd that the wings appear not to show any violet or blue. Head<br>&gt;&gt; and underparts resemble the nominate form of Racquet-tailed, but not the<br>&gt;&gt; upperparts so there is clearly a mix,
 but of what ?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; What date was this photo taken, and roughly where in the Mara. Any other<br>&gt;&gt; rollers nearby ?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; In the past there have been a few odd-looking Abyssinian as far south as<br>&gt;&gt; the Mara and northern Serengeti that have become lost individuals. If<br>&gt;&gt; they did hybridize with Lilac-breasted would the underparts be as rich a<br>&gt;&gt; blue as this bird ?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Total mystery, lets hope it gets donated to science.<br>&gt;&gt; Don<br>&gt;&gt; --<br>&gt;&gt; I'd rather go birding...<br>&gt;&gt; ***************************************<br>&gt;&gt; Itai Shanni<br>&gt;&gt; Eilat &amp; Arave Region Coordinator,<br>&gt;&gt; Israel Ornithological Centre (BirdLife partner in Israel)<br>&gt;&gt; Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel (SPNI)<br>&gt;&gt; <a ymailto="mailto:iocitai@inter.net.il" href="mailto:iocitai@inter.net.il">iocitai@inter.net.il</a>, <a
