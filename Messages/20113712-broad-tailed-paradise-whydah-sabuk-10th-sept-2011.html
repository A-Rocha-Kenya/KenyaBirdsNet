  Hi all,<br><br>Just wanted to report a very exciting find at Sabuk 2 days ago - a male Broad-tailed Paradise Whydah with an Eastern Paradise. Both Vic and I saw plenty of this species in Mikumi NP, Tanzania a few years ago. I gather that Kenyan records are few and far between these days. Sadly no photos taken but will gladly write a report if required.<br>
<br>Also, 4 Caspian Plover in the Mara on 2nd and 3rd Sept.<br><br>Lots of great birding up country over the past 8 days and we&#39;re heading to Samburu today...<br><br>Very best,<br><br>Adam<br><br>
