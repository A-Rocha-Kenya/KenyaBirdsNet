  <pre>Dear Felix,
I am sure they would have been Amurs, Eurasian Hobbies to not
associate in such large congregations. Female and immature Amurs look
quite hobby-like with the pale throat and in dark skies the underwing
contrast of the male is not as evident as in clear skies.
A very good record for Nairobi.
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Goodmorning all.
&gt;
&gt; Yesterday evening (Wednesday 30th November), two friends and I
&gt; witnessed what looked like migration of falcons. Literally hundreds
&gt; (500+) of them were flying overhead, moving in a roughly north-
&gt; westerly direction. We witnessed this from my mum and dad&#39;s home in
&gt; Hardy, Karen. I was overawed by the sight, seeing that it was my first
&gt; time seeing such a large migrating flock.
&gt;
&gt; Did anyone else see this yesterday? I would also appreciate help in
&gt; confirming that it was indeed Amur falcons that I saw, and not, say,
&gt; Eurasian hobbies. The sky was overcast, and so the lighting was not
&gt; that great. The distinctiveness of the falcon silhouette was however
&gt; clearly visible, but the two-toned underside wing of the Amur was not
&gt; very evident. In at least two birds, I observed a white throat patch,
&gt; suggesting the E. Hobby, but the dusk light made it difficult to
&gt; observe much more than that. Does anyone know if the two travel
&gt; together?
&gt;
&gt; Looking forward to hearing what the experts have to say.
&gt;
&gt; Felix
