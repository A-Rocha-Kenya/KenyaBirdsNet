  <pre>Good day netters.

Hope that you are all well and enjoying some winter birding.

I apologise if this has been asked earlier, but my wife and I are new  
on the kenyabirdnet. My wife needs some slight repair work done on her  
Pentax binoculars. Nothing majorâ€”the rubber housing of her eyepiece  
came loose, and will need some good quality gluing work done on it.  
The eyepiece itself also needs some serious lubrication, and the one  
lubricant that I tried does not seem to have done the trick.

Anyone know of a good store I could go to here in Nairobi that can  
help me out?

Thanks in advance.
Felix
