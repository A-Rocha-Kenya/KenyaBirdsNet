  <pre>Hi Tom,
I was in Kipini, Nairobi Ranch and Witu 18th-21st May this year doing
a bird survey with a well known Kenyan bunch, and although we had some
good birds we never saw nor heard a Crowned Eagle. The habitat through
the seasonal wetlands, and of course Witu looks ideal but we never had
any evidence of the existence of the bird there.
Best for now
Brian

&gt; just to say that CE occur throughout the coastal lowlands of Tanzania but
&gt; rainfall in these areas far higher than coastal Kenya north of Mombasa. Far
&gt; easier for birds to disperse as suitable hunting habitat occurs westwards to
&gt; the base of the Eastern Arc mts. This map 3 years out of date. the SE VERY
&gt; poorly worked.
&gt;
&gt; however densities are lower in the coastal lowlands.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Dear All,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Dr. Julie Wieczkowski recovered the skull of an adult
&gt; male Tana River Mangabey in Mcheleo Forest, lower Tana River, in
&gt; 2006.  The punctures in the skull make us strongly suspect that this
&gt; monkey was was killed by an African Crowned Eagle.  We have drafted a note
&gt; on this finding.  Here is what the draft now says about the occurrence of
&gt; the African Crowned Eagle along the lower Tana River.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Crowned eagles at the lower Tana River
&gt;&gt;Crowned
&gt; eagles are present in the forests of the lower Tana River (Andrews et al.,
&gt; 1975;
&gt; Lewis and Pomeroy, 1989; Zimmerman et al., 1999; D.N.M. Mbora, pers. comm.).
&gt; They are, however, uncommon; there are few observations of crowned eagles,
&gt; no
&gt; nests have been confirmed, and none of the current researchers have heard
&gt; the
&gt; far-carrying, distinctive, prolonged display call during many years of
&gt; research
&gt; in these forests (D.N.M. Mbora, pers. comm.; T.M. Butynski and J.
&gt; Wieczkowski,
&gt; pers. obs.).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I write this to ask whether any of the readers have seen or
&gt; heard the African Crowned Eagle in the forests of the lower Tana
&gt; River....either
&gt; in the distant past or recently.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Monkeys remain extremely abundant in these forests....and
&gt; other prey of the Crowned Eagle (e.g., dik-dik) are also present.  The
&gt; current absence, or very low density, of Crowned Eagles in the forests of
&gt; the
&gt; lower Tana River is difficult to explain, although my own impression is
&gt; that, for whatever reason, the Crowned Eagle is more a bird of
&gt; mid-altitude and montane forest than of lowland / coastal forest.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Any comments are appreciated!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Best regards,
&gt;&gt;
