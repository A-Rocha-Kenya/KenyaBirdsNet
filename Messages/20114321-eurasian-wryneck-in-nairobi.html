  <pre>A Lifer outside my window!

Stayed home to work at my computer today and was rewarded by a Eurasian
Wryneck in the bush outside my window! Pale buffy throat with fine barring
clearly seen. What a surprise!

At Olorgesailie on Nov 20 with Nature Kenya&#39;s Sunday Birdwatch,
Yellow-spotted Petronias were calling and displaying, flashing their
seldom-seen yellow throat patch.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
