  Hi All,<br><br>Yesterday afternoon (26th Oct) was productive with a Sooty Falcon and an adult Black Stork both close to the Talek River between Naibor and Rekero Camps. I also managed to take my first images of Flappet Lark on the deck which was personally rewarding.<br>
<br>On 24th, there were two Rufous-crowned Rollers in Naboisho Conservancy but no sign of any Karamoja Apalis. Several small parties of Chestnut Sparrow there also.<br><br>On 21st, I found my first Black-lored Babblers in the Mara, a party of nine mobbing a hidden snake with Grey-backed Fiscals just outside of Talek Gate.<br>
<br>Vicki and I will be heading to the coast on 31st October for 2 weeks leave, starting at Diani Beach for 5 nights then A Rocha at Malindi for 5 nights where we aim to explore Arabuko-Sokoke forest for the first time. Any guidance and advice from the group on birding in this area would be warmly welcomed. <br>
<br>Best wishes,<br><br>Adam<br>Naibor Camp, Masai Mara<br><br><br><br>Â  <br><div style="visibility: hidden; left: -5000px; position: absolute; z-index: 9999; padding: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px; overflow: hidden; word-wrap: break-word; color: black; font-size: 10px; text-align: left; line-height: 130%;" id="avg_ls_inline_popup">
