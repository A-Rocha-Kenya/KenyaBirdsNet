  <pre>Hi All,

Just wanted to share my sighting of an adult Western Banded Snake
Eagle in the Mara yesterday, which was my first sighting of this
species since I arrived last February. It was perched in trees along
the lugger upstream of Irish Bridge about 5km south of Naibor and
looked quite at home there.

Cheers

Adam
