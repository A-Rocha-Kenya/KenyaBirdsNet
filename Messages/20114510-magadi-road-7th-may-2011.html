  <pre>Today I went down the horribly cratered Magadi Road, with a visitor
from the U.N. It was green and lush where not charcoaled, and there
was some standing water. Lyne&#39;s Cisticolas were very vocal at Corner
Baridi, where there was little else apart from Hidebrandt&#39;s Francolins
calling from up on the hill. At Kisamese there is now a pair of
Short-tailed Larks feeding young in a nest, in the same place as I saw
them on the recent Rockjumper tour, and a Lesser Grey Shrike was also
here. Apart from the normal residents there were two Great Reed, a
Sedge and  three Willow Warblers. Whilst we did not go through into
Magadi town the were still surprising numbers of Ruff and Little Stint
on the roadside pools, and one lone Chestnut-banded Plover.
