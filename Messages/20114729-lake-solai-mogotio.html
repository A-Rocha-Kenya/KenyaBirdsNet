  <hr/>
  <pre>Further to emails earlier in the year regarding Lake Solai near Mogotio, 
I wrote to Ian Marshall who used to live and work on a sisal farm near 
there to see if he knew of the site and the birds on it. He responded 
with the following which may be of interest to those who have visited 
there (does anyone have a separate record of the Woodchat and Masked 
Shrike records for this site?):

Colin.

So herewith additions to the Lake Solai Area summary of birds from our
1960-80 lists:

D&#39;Arnauds Barbet
