Today<br>Nigel came around to show me the images that he had received from Pete<br>Steward, including some really superb female Red-shouldered<br>Cuckoo-shrike in case there is any doubt that the species can be<br>readily separated in the field from female Black Cuckoo-shrike.<br>We were going through the images on my computer, just to appreciate<br>them and a beautiful image of a Marico Sunbird came up on the screen.<br>I remember how
 hyperactive they were in the flowering tree, and how I<br>called them as Marico and moved on to more interesting western birds.<br>Pete had secured this very nice image, and staring back at me was not<br>a Marico, but the tell-tale violet forehead (and narrow reddish breast<br>band) which were not seen in the field, made it instantly recognisable<br>as a male Orange-tufted Sunbird! There has probably not been a<br>substantiated record in Kenya for over twenty years, and even many<br>past records are viewed with some doubt.<br>With Peters permission, I have attached it to this email alongside a<br>Marico from Laikipia.<br><br>So the Western trip report should be amended as<br><br>Orange-tufted Sunbird&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cinnyris bouvieri<br>A couple seen near Nambale were a very exciting discovery, not<br>realized at the time. They were taken as Marico Sunbirds whilst there,<br>and it is only going through Pete Stewards excellent
 photographs, that<br>our oversight was brought home with a thud. A stunning adult male<br>Orange-tufted with it’s violet forecrown, and distinctly different<br>underparts was staring back off the screen. In defence it is difficult<br>to see subtleties in iridescence on these very active birds, but I<br>have been recording Marico Sunbirds there for years (far from more<br>than 25% of visits though), and have called them Marico. Perhaps<br>Marico has never occurred there!<br><br><br>Best&nbsp; all<br>Brian<br><br><br></div></div></div></body></html>
