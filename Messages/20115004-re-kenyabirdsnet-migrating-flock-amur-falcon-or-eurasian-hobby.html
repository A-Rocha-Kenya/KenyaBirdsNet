      <div>Dear Felix,<br>
I am sure they would have been Amurs, Eurasian Hobbies to not<br>
associate in such large congregations. Female and immature Amurs look<br>
quite hobby-like with the pale throat and in dark skies the underwing<br>
contrast of the male is not as evident as in clear skies.<br>
A very good record for Nairobi.<br>
Best for now<br>
Brian<br>

&gt; Goodmorning all.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Yesterday evening (Wednesday 30th November), two friends and I<br>
&gt; witnessed what looked like migration of falcons. Literally hundreds<br>
&gt; (500+) of them were flying overhead, moving in a roughly north-<br>
&gt; westerly direction. We witnessed this from my mum and dad's home in<br>
&gt; Hardy, Karen. I was overawed by the sight, seeing that it was my first<br>
&gt; time seeing such a large migrating flock.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Did anyone else see this yesterday? I would also appreciate help in<br>
&gt; confirming that it was indeed Amur falcons that I saw, and not, say,<br>
&gt; Eurasian hobbies. The sky was overcast, and so the lighting was not<br>
&gt; that great. The distinctiveness of the falcon silhouette was however<br>
&gt; clearly visible, but the two-toned underside wing of the Amur was not<br>
&gt; very evident. In at least two birds, I observed a white throat patch,<br>
&gt; suggesting the E. Hobby, but the dusk light made it difficult to<br>
&gt; observe much more than that. Does anyone know if the two travel<br>
&gt; together?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Looking forward to hearing what the experts have to say.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Felix<br>
