  <pre>Hi Tracy, James and all who have replied.

We shall look at Samish Photolab in Yaya and see what they come up  
with. The Ornithology Dept. of Nature Kenya was the other offline  
recommendation that we got from James.

Asanteni sana. Happy winter birding.

Regards,
Felix

&gt; We were recently recommended Samish Photolab in the Yaya Centre and  
&gt; they
&gt; have my Bushnells there at the moment.  They charge Shs 750:00  
&gt; handling fee
&gt; and send the binos to their workshop where a quote is given which  
&gt; you can
&gt; accept or refuse.
&gt;
&gt; Sure there must be other places out there too, which I would also be
&gt; interested to learn about, especially if they are the Thika side of  
&gt; Nairobi
&gt; as Yaya is difficult for us to get to - and still remain sane.
&gt;
&gt; Kind regards

&gt;
&gt; Good day netters.
&gt;
&gt; Hope that you are all well and enjoying some winter birding.
&gt;
&gt; I apologise if this has been asked earlier, but my wife and I are new
&gt; on the kenyabirdnet. My wife needs some slight repair work done on her
&gt; Pentax binoculars. Nothing major-the rubber housing of her eyepiece
&gt; came loose, and will need some good quality gluing work done on it.
&gt; The eyepiece itself also needs some serious lubrication, and the one
&gt; lubricant that I tried does not seem to have done the trick.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone know of a good store I could go to here in Nairobi that can
&gt; help me out?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance.
&gt; Felix
