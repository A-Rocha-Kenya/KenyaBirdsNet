  <pre>Good morning Felix

We were recently recommended Samish Photolab in the Yaya Centre and they
have my Bushnells there at the moment.  They charge Shs 750:00 handling fee
and send the binos to their workshop where a quote is given which you can
accept or refuse.

Sure there must be other places out there too, which I would also be
interested to learn about, especially if they are the Thika side of Nairobi
as Yaya is difficult for us to get to - and still remain sane.

Kind regards
Tracy Pallister

Good day netters.

Hope that you are all well and enjoying some winter birding.

I apologise if this has been asked earlier, but my wife and I are new  
on the kenyabirdnet. My wife needs some slight repair work done on her  
Pentax binoculars. Nothing major-the rubber housing of her eyepiece  
came loose, and will need some good quality gluing work done on it.  
The eyepiece itself also needs some serious lubrication, and the one  
lubricant that I tried does not seem to have done the trick.

Anyone know of a good store I could go to here in Nairobi that can  
help me out?

Thanks in advance.
Felix
