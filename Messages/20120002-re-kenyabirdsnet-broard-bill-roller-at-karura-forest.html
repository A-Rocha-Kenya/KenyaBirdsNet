  <pre>Dear George,
I think you will find that the male was courtship-feeding a female
prior to mating, rather than any relationship with a juvenile,
Best for now

&gt; Hello Birders&#39;
&gt;
&gt; Despite the heavy rainfalls going on around Nairobi i managed to visit
&gt; Karura forest yesterday for a walk.
&gt;
&gt; Karura has life for so many church groups having their walk, other people
&gt; jogging,bicycle rides and of course a perfect place for see forest birds.We
&gt; must not forget to thank (AFEW) African fund for endangered wildlife for
&gt; constructing stairs to caves and a path bridge along Karura river.
&gt;
&gt; Broad-billed Roller seated on croton tree,Brown-troated Alethe at under
&gt; growth,Cabanis&#39;s Greenbul and klaas&#39;s cuckoo male feeding young one of which
&gt; i was shocked coz all i know is that klaas&#39;s cuckoo are nest parasite on
&gt; sunbirds nest. My worry is do they take care of the young ones after the
&gt; sunbirds  realises that they are growing at an amazing rate.
&gt;
&gt; George.
