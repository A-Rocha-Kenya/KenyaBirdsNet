  <div>Hi All,</div><div> </div><div>Last night (22nd July), 3 male Pennant-winged Nightjars in the air together (my best night yet), 21st there were none and we had a male and female on both 19th and 20th. As usual, they all arrived around 7pm and flew straight over camp in a SSE direction. Vicki watched them from the other side of camp (south-facing) last night and said they made a bee-line straight into Serengeti and certainly weren&#39;t hanging around. This really is quite something! </div>
<div> </div><div>Also, a Grey-rumped Swallow in front of Sala&#39;s Camp this morning in a mixed swift-swallow flock over 1000s of Gnu, but no further sign of the Blue Swallows.</div><div> </div><div>Best for now,</div><div>
Adam</div><div> </div><div>ps - this wildebeest migration is shaping up to be absolutely vast; 100,000s in the southern Mara and even more working their way in from the south west. The biggest yet maybe???</div>
