  Hi All,<br><br>I found this Ant Lion in camp (Naibor, Masai Mara) a few days ago. It was by far the most attractive Ant Lion I&#39;ve ever seen and also the biggest with a total length of 6cm.<br><br>Does anyone have access to an insect guide for ID? Or maybe you know a good entomologist that could help?<br>
<br>Many thanks,<br><br>Adam <br><br><br>
