For a year or so, I have been eagerly anticipating the release of the Bird Sounds of East Africa collection. &nbsp;I was wondering if anybody had any information on this collection and specifically the release date? This is going to be a great collection and I am very anxious to ge my hands on it as I'm sure most of Kenya's birder population is.&nbsp;</div><div>Also, after just returning to Nairobi after a trip to the coast I was wondering some things about species splits.</div><div>1. Is the Tropical Boubou split into East Coast Boubou and Tropical Boubou?</div><div>2. Is Black-and-white Mannikin split into Red-backed Mannikin and Black-and-white Mannikin</div><div>3. Are the Taita White-eye and Taita Apalis considered their own species or still considered different races of Montane White-eye and
 Bar-throated Apalis?</div><div><br></div><div>thank you! any help on answering these questions would be very awesome.. especially regarding the bird sound collection, I am very excited to own this collection!</div></div></body></html>
