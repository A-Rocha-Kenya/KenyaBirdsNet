  <pre>Hello birders,

I have a chance to be visiting OPC in eastern Laikipia and was lucky
to add a new species on my life list, Shelly&#39;s  Francolin.

Two pairs were slowly, quietly crossing the road. In respect of bush&#39;s
traffic code, I waited for &gt;6 min for them to walk the 4m wide road!

This was yest. 15 July 2012. Prior to this and about 100m away, lions
were enjoying a Zebra kill for a breakfast.

More listing later on.

Wams.
