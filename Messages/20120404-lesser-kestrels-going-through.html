  <pre>Two tatty ones feeding on emerging termites, early on April 2, in West  
Arusha (30 km south of the border - as the falcon flies).
Also lots of Barn Swallows heading east most days, and small flocks of  
European Bee-eaters (average 15 birds in each) overhead due north.

Heavy rain, at long last, this morning - the first significant rain  
here since cyclone Imelda in late February.

Happy Birding,
James
