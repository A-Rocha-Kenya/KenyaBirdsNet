  <pre>Greetings birders

Rain in Nairobi at last! The winged termites are a feast for passing
migrants. Nature Kenya&#39;s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk on April 4 began in the
bird gallery inside the National Museum, but around 10 am it was deemed
bright enough to step out on the museum grounds.

Migrants included Red-backed Shrike, Eurasian Golden Oriole, Eastern
Olivaceous Warbler, many Willow Warblers, Common Whitethroat, Thrush
Nightingale (Sprosser), Spotted Flycatcher and Tree Pipit.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
