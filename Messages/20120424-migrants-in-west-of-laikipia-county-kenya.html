  <hr/>
  <div>Dear Birders,</div><div> </div><div>I had some good nine days in Ol Al Nyiro, also called Laikipia Nature Conservancy situated in the western end of Laikipia County overlooking Lake Baringo, between 13 and 22 April 2012. </div>
<div> </div><div>Although I concentrated my efforts in two areas, Engelesha Forest and Muktan Gorge, I came up with a list of over 160 species. Among these were PM migrants notably: Willow Warbler, Common Greenshank, Wood &amp; Common Sandpipers, Marsh Warbler, Eurasian Cuckoo, Nightngale, Yellow Wagtail, White Stork and Eurasian Bee-eaters. The latter 2 were flying north.</div>
<div> </div><div>The locals include: Brown-backed Woodpecker, a displaying male of Denham&#39;s Bustard (both lifers for my list), Crested Guineafowl (feathers seen in the forest and also heard), Narina Trogon, Grey Cuckoo-Shrike, Hartlaub&#39;s Turaco, a pair Barn Owls chicks, African Thrush, Arrow-marked Babbler, chick of Tambourine Dove, and a pair of breeding Brown Parrot.</div>
<div> </div><div>LNC is a wonderful place for birds.</div><div> </div><div>Wamiti.</div><br>
