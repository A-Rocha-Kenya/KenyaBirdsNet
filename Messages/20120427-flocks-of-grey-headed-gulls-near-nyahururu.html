  <div>Hello Birders,</div><div> </div><div>I trust the weather haven&#39;t stopped you from looking at birds. I as at Kasuku near Nyahururu yesterday (26/4, 16:00hrs) along the highway heading to Gilgil and came across three (3) groups of low-flying (10-15 m or so) <strong>Grey-head Gulls</strong> each with <strong>over 100 birds</strong>. I don&#39;t think they were feeding on the wing but do think they may have been finding their route westerwards to either Lake Elementaita or Nakuru as suggested by the flock &#39;leaders&#39;. </div>
<div> </div><div>Perhaps they spend the day feeding at Lake Ol&#39; Bolossat (only 6-7km east of the highway) and goes &#39;home&#39; elsewhere. We need to find out more about them. Many of the native ponds aroun are filling with water and will soon be filled up with croaking frogs!, and herons will come over for the easy meals of tadpoles. Keep watching.</div>
<div> </div><div>Nice birding though,</div><div> </div><div>Wamiti.</div>
