  <hr/>
  <div>Dear Birders,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>last Wednesday we had sightings of 3 Cuckoo species (Common Cuckoos, Barred Long-tailed Cuckoo &amp; Lesser Cuckoo)! Only the Lesser Cuckoo allowed me to take a few snaps though it literally took us round in circles but never flew too far off!</div>

<div> </div>
<div>By the way..am  recording all our birdwalks with Kelvin Mazera at the Nature Sanctuary in facebook &quot;Let&#39;s go birding at Nguuni Nature Sanctuary, Kenya&quot;. Just in case you would like to know more about birding in the Mombasa area &amp; please note...am a beginner &amp; also not a &quot;professional&quot; photographer!!</div>

<div>Why not join us one day?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Happy Birding!!</div>
<div>Greetings from coastal Kenya</div>
