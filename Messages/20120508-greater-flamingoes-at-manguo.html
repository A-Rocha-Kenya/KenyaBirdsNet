Though in a speeding matatu<br>
the day before yesterday 6th May were 2 Greater Flamingoes at Manguo
Ponds. The water level was highest i've ever seen on this pan. Also the
highest altitude i've seen them. Reminded me seeing a flamingo road kill
at Gilgil 8 year ago....weird.<br>
Good day and birding<br>
