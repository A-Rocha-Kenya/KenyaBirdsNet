  <pre>Dear All,
On the 12th May, Mike Davidson, Karen Plumbe and myself had a day along the
Magadi Road. We spent most of the day in the bushland at Ol Tepesi, but on
the eastern (left) side of the road and drove eight kilometres to the base
of some bushed hills that are being charcoaled.
In the lowlands there were good numbers of Cardinal Queleas in breeding
plumage, and we located one stunning Fire-fronted Bishop.
There was a good selection of dry-country species, and we also had a late
(hepatic) Common Cuckoo.
There were also some mammals in the area, Grantâ€™s Gazelle were numerous
although only five Zebra. The more interesting being over twenty Gerenuk,
and in the hillside acacia scrub, six Lesser Kudu.
Following the rains, the area is so green and lush, even areas where the
trees had been removed for the charcoal industry, the ground was covered by
a green swathe and colourful wildflowers, the Magadi Road however resembles
a moonscape!
Best to all,
Brian
