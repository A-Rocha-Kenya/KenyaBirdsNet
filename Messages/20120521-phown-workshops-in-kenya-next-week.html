  <pre>Hi all

Two workshops on PHOWN (Photos of Weaver Nests) will be held in Kenya
next week. A workshop will be hosted at the Nairobi National Museum,
Nairobi, from 28-30 May 2012. A second workshop will be held in Watamu
on the Kenyan coast on 1-2 June. Anybody is welcome to attend! A brief
outline follows below and see

There will be daily lectures at 14h00, followed by tea and practical
demonstrations

PHOWN is a citizen science project of the Animal Demography Unit, to
collect and monitor breeding distributions and colony sizes of weaver
birds globally.

These workshops are funded by Project for the Enhancement of Research

PS I&#39;ll be leaving from Mombasa on 4 June and will probably have time
to do some birding in the morning - any birding tips for Mombasa will
be welcome.
