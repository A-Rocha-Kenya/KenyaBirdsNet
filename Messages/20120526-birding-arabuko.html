  <pre>Hi all me and my client Rick and his guest from Australia, Rob Dunn baord member at Birdlife Australia, on 20th of this month we had a good walk at the arabuko sokoke forest early morning. we keen looking for the special six which we could sight during our walk. we had great time with general birds, and we found male Amani sunbird high up on the branch of brachystegia prinning it was a pleasant disply it had to us. we later drove to near cynometra thicket on the Nyari road, here we were amased with a flock of feeding party with Clarckes weaver. we had to crawl down into to the thicket, the party had Chest nut fronted helmet shrike, common scimitar bill, mombasa woodpecker and we managed to pick two females of the clarckes weaver.
Now it seems as we now that we only get them at brachystegia woodland is has been resent observed at Cynometra thicket by Guides at Arabuko. so i just confirm what i was told.
great time use local guide to see what you are after. i am back to Lumo sanctuary. See me on Lions Bluff Lodge face book, 
I welcome you all to nature and people.
