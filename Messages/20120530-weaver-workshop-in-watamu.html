  <hr/>
  <pre>For anyone who is interested and hasn&#39;t received the news any other way, 
Dieter Oschadleus from the University of Cape Town and SAFRING (Southern 
African ringing scheme) will be giving a couple of lectures on weaver 
biology and explaining how anyone can get involved with the Africa-wide 
project on weaver nests and colonies called &#39;PHOWN&#39; at the Gede Forest 
Station on Saturday 2nd June.

Dieter is a leading expert on weaver breeding biology and has just given 
the series of well-attended lectures at the National Museums of Kenya in 
Nairobi this week.

The workshop will start at 8:30am on Saturday in the KWS Education 
Centre of the forest station at Gede. Mid-morning refreshments will be 
provided but please be ready for providing your own lunch. If anyone has 
digital images of weavers already for which you know the date and 
location, please bring them with you and they will be used as an example 
of how to take part in the project.
