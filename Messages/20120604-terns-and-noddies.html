  <pre>Having looked a couple of weeks ago and seen nothing, there are now 
c.3,000 Brown Noddies circling Whale Island off Watamu in the late 
evening just before dusk. I&#39;ve not seen them actually settling on the 
island but it is highly likely that they do so just as it is getting 
dark - too dark to see from 2kms away onland. In the morning there&#39;s no 
sign of them but there are now white terns, presumed Roseates (which 
I&#39;ve seen in breeding plumage along the beach to the north of Watamu 
this weekend) prospecting for nesting. We&#39;ll be starting the monitoring 
of the 2012 breeding attempt this month and it&#39;ll be interesting to see 
if they nest on Whale Island this year or go back to Darakasi like last 
year where they had such dismal success with the robbing of nests by 
boys thus almost entirely wiping out the colony.

With the very strong sustained winds we&#39;re experiencing (and precious 
little rain...) I expect there must be some more oddities blown in from 
out at sea.. the odd prion for example??! Anyone at the coast who walks 
the beaches or knows friends who do should look out for beached birds 
including carcasses which can produce very interesting records.
