  <pre>Dear Birders,

The Purple-crested Turaco has been sighted once more at the Nairobi Arboretum while on a Nature Kenya Wednesday birdwalk. This means the turaco has been dwelling the arboretum for the past 9 or so day since its recent sighting on 25th June.

Just as previous, this beautiful bird gave the birder ample time including Fleur (leading the walk) and Peter Usher (for a good photo shoot) and confirmation of it being a Purple-crested rather than an assumption of an immature Hartlaub&#39;s.

Happy birding

Joshua Wambugu
