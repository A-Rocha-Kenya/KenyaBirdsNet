<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><span style="font-size:14pt;">Hi Jeff!<br>
<br>
Very exciting. We used to see Southern Ground Hornbill regularly in the Rift, around Naivasha, Gilgil, Nakuru, but not recently. Itâ€™s great that they are in Kijabe again!<br>
<br>
You know that they are now considered threatened? They are listed as Vulnerable in the IUCN Red List.<br>
<br>
With best wishes from Fleur<br>

This spectacular bird has been on our school grounds for the past week, being very vocal as well. I have heard there are some others by the Kijabe Mission Hospital but have not confirmed it. I have not seen these here before, anyone else have records of them either in the Rift (near Longonot) or on the eastern escarpment? <br>
<br>
A few weeks ago I also discovered 3 Cape Eagle-Owls roosting on some cliffs in the Forest. <br>
