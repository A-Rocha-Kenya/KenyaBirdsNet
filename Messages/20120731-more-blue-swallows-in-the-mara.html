  <hr/>
  <div>Hi All,</div><div> </div><div>Yesterday evening, Vicki and I took a short drive from Sala&#39;s Camp across the Keekorok River, about 1-2km due south of Roan Hill and eastwards of camp to an area of lighly bushed grassland. Here we located a flock of 26 Blue Swallows, including several males in FBP. No doubt, these are the same birds we found a few weeks ago but these birds have moulted significantly since then and looked a great deal smarter. It would appear from their behaviour that they are not commuting to a major river to roost but are staying in situ for their &quot;overnights&quot;.</div>
<div> </div><div>Also a family of Broad-tailed Warbler at the same spot.</div><div> </div><div>No PWNJs last night, but there were 3 birds seen on the evenings of 28th and 29th, and 2 on 27th - all males.</div><div> </div>
<div>Best for now,</div><div>Adam</div>
