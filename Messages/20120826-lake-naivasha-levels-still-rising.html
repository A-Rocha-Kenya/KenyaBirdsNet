<DIV>Greetings birders</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The level of Lake Naivasha is still rising, and had reached the edge of the 
acacia woodland at the KWS Hippo Camp property on 19 August when Nature Kenyaâ€™s 
Sunday Birdwatch visited. It was strange to see waterbirds flying among the 
acacias. The large floating island on which we had counted so many egrets on the 
July waterbird count had completely disappeared; boats were moored at the end of 
the causeway; and we had clear views over water to Crescent and Yatch Club 
islands. Bird highlights included:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>A group of Pink-backed Pelicans fishing cooperatively</DIV>
<DIV>An African Fish Eagle with two flying immatures</DIV>
<DIV>Four Black-tailed Godwits flying over</DIV>
<DIV>Several Black Cuckoos, mostly the type with reddish throats and barred 
bellies. They sang their characteristic call, and another song that sounded 
extremely similar to the Green Wood-Hoopoe (that we also saw and heard).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Wishing you good birding, Fleur</DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
