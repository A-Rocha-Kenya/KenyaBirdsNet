  <hr/>
  <pre>A couple of friends and i had chance to birdwatch in a boat at Manguo Swamp, Nairobi.
We do most of the birding on the shores but no one has an idea of what hapens in the middle of the swamp!
We found a good number of sacred ibises nesting . Surprisingly, a number of them dead just besides the nests! Not sure whether they were the owners of the nests or intrudeers! I doubt if they were intruders!
They hatch, they grow and breed too, then they die! Something should be done, atleast to know the cause of death then try and solve the problem.
Birding around Nairobi has been great this year. Enjoy birding
