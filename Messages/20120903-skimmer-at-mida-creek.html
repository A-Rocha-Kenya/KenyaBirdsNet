  <pre>Have just received a message from Juma Badi at Mida Creek, one of the 
main bird guides at the boardwalk telling me they saw an African Skimmer 
this morning at Mida Creek - this is the first I&#39;ve heard there though 
there may be records I&#39;m not aware of?

There have also been several Golden Pipits at Mida the past 4-6 weeks 
which have been a delight to see. First White-throated Bee-eater of the 
season there as well on 24th August.

Looking at the breeding data for the Roseate Terns on Whale Island over 
the past 12 years, it is very clear that they breed in alternate years - 
every &#39;odd&#39; year, they breed, and even years they don&#39;t. A really 
interesting breeding cycle for them that we are keen to investigate - 
why don&#39;t they breed every year like they do on the Seychelles? It may 
also be true on other colonies - certainly this year they didn&#39;t breed 
on Kisite - just as they have not on Whale Island. If anyone has any 
information on the northern colonies for this year, it would be really 
useful to know.
