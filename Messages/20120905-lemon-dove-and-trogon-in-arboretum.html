  <pre>Greetings birders

Despite grey skies, Nature Kenya&#39;s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk spent a great
morning in the Nairobi Arboretum.

Highlights included a Lemon Dove on the forest floor who quickly walked
across the path; a Narina Trogon in the natural forest near the entrance;
and a Green-headed Sunbird near the river. Thanks to all for their good
spotting.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
