  <pre>Hello Birders,

Hope this finds you well.

Today morning at the Arboretum in company of Charles Mwangi, and Peter Wairasho on an environmental education tour with Aga Khan Academy pupil, heard the call that have become a common within the Arboretum of the Purple-crested Turaco. We later sighted it.

The Turaco seems to have become a &#39;resident&#39; to this green gem since its sighting in 25th June, 4th July....and many other times since then. It was first sighted down at Kirichwa Kubwa river at the Podo Path, now it has concentrated it forage next to Forester&#39;s office and Atrium circle for those conversant with the Arboretum trails.

The turaco is very patience to the birdwatchers taking it time at one perching spot before hopping away...

In search of it..????...listen to a deep voiced call as compared to the &#39;softer&#39; call of Hartlaub&#39;s...You may also join Friends of Nairobi Arboretum during naturewalk tomorrow (8th Sept; second Saturday of the month) and try the luck.

Great birding.

Joshua
