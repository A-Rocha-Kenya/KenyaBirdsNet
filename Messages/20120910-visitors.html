  <pre>Hello birders,

Last week,we had interesting visitors to loisaba wildreness in Laikipia.These includes&gt;Woolly necked stork,African black dark,yellow billed stork,and a malachite kingfisher all spotted on Ewaso nyiro river.An adult dark phase Augar Buzzard which might be confused with Bateleur from a distance,Rosy breasted longclaw rarely seen.
  we were lucky enough to see AFRICAN CLAWLESS OTTER swimming between two Hippos,while Egyptian geese were watching.

Lawrence
