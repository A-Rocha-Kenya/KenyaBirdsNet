There is still dry land back</span><br><span>from this and it still holds the woodland species.</span><br><span>There were no margins for waders, and we were only to see four Common</span><br><span>Sandpiper, one Green Sandpiper and two Common Greenshank. The resident</span><br><span>plovers included a couple of Long-toed. There were also no ducks apart</span><br><span>from a scattering of Yellow-billed and one Red-billed Teal and of</span><br><span>course plenty of Egyptian Geese. Tern and Gull numbers were way down</span><br><span>with a number of Grey-headed Gulls and Whiskered Terns but only one</span><br><span>Gull-billed Tern. There were plenty of Yellow-billed Storks and Grey</span><br><span>Herons, but only four African Spoonbills and one each of Glossy Ibis</span><br><span>and Goliath Heron. There were only three Squacco Herons as well. There</span><br><span>wasn’t a Coot to be seen here, but Little Grebes and Common Moorhens</span><br><span>were fairly common. There were a number of Giant Kingfishers using the</span><br><span>flooded acacias as perches. With Mottled and Black Swift there was a</span><br><span>single House Martin, Nigel saw a Sand Martin, there were small numbers</span><br><span>of Barn Swallows and two Grey-rumped Swallows present. A Yellow</span><br><span>Wagtail flew around but did not land, and we heard another two flying</span><br><span>south very high, that we could not see. In the profuse flowering Fever</span><br><span>Trees there was a Willow Warbler busily chasing insect around the</span><br><span>flowers. There were five species of cuckoos in song, Red-chested,</span><br><span>Black, African, Diederic and Klaas’. Interestingly the Black consisted</span><br><span>of both all black nominate, and the red-chested gabonensis that we</span><br><span>have come to expect here. Other birds included several Brown</span><br><span>Parisomas, and Grey-backed Fiscals seemed more numerous than usual.</span><br><span>The only raptors that were not &nbsp;Fish-Eagles were singles of Gabar</span><br><span>Goshawk, and the resident race of Peregrine. The whole area look very</span><br><span>attractive at present.</span><br><span>From here we looked at Oloidien which had two-hundred Flamingos, eight</span><br><span>of which were Greater, a Ringed Plover and fifteen Little Stints.</span><br><span>There were good numbers of ducks in the NW corner which included</span><br><span>parties of Cape Wigeon and Southern Pochard. Manguo Ponds had over</span><br><span>thirty Black-winged Stilt (the only stilts seen all day), four Ruff</span><br><span>and a Little Stint. We watched a pair of Maccoa Ducks displaying, and</span><br><span>there were about fifty White-backed Ducks, otherwise there was nothing</span><br><span>out of the ordinary.</span><br><span>Best to all</span><br><span>Brian</span><br></div></blockquote></body></html>
