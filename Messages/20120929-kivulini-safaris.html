  <pre>Dear All,
I stumbled on this completely by accident. Does anyone have any idea
who Kivulini Safaris is. Apparently they say I am organising their
tours, and it has come as a surprise unless I was doing it in my
sleep.
This is the address I have located. I must say they have drenched the
internet. The details of the management is supposed to be on Linked
In, but I am not. If anyone could check on this it would be
appreciated.
Thanks for help,
Brian
