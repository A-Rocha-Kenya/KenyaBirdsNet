Before there is too much of a furore about this, it would be good to confirm if it was CMC who cut the trees. I passed by there on Tuesday and saw the trees had gone - but it&#39;s not all the trees, nor is it necessarily the trees that are closest to CMC. Marabous are still nesting on the remaining trees in fact. The main tree that was cut is the huge one on the roundabout and talking with the taxi driver about it, he said it was because the roundabout is going to be removed and a fly-over put in to ease traffic congestion</pre>
