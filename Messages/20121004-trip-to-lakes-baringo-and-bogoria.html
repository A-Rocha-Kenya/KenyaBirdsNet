 Tiren was our guide and hats off to him he showed many of us lifers 
galore. The highlights were the owls (Eurasian Scops, White-faced Scops,
 Greyish Eagle Owl, Spotted Eagle Owl, Pearl Spotted Owlet and 
Verreaux&#39;s Eagle Owl), a spectacular heronry amongst the flooded trees 
of what was once the shoreline (black-headed herons, squacco herons, 
black egrets, great-white egrets, little egrets, yellow-billed egrets, 
reed cormorants, great cormorants, black-crowned night heron, 
darters...wonderful!) and for us the red-fronter warbler, pale prinia, 
bristle-crowned starling, Hemprich&#39;s Hornbill, Brown-tailed Rock Chat, 
Great Spotted Cuckoo, Rufous Crowned Roller, Yellow-vented Eremomela, 
Rufous Chatterer and Northern Puffback. The Fish Eagles and Goliath 
Herons were glorius and a magnificent pair of Verreaux&#39;s Eagles hunted 
over the cliffs in search of unwary Rock Hyrax. The full list is attached.</span><br style="font-weight:normal"><br style="font-weight:normal"><span style="font-weight:normal">We stayed at Soi Safari Lodge, which was fine for food and 
service with a good pool to cool off in, however it does not offer the 
natural surrounds and lake-front access you will find at the other 
Lodges. They also have a caged collection of birds and primates which is
 awful due to the tiny cages the animals are kept in. They have even a 
fish eagle in a cage, which is just stupid, you can see them very easily
 in the Lake anyway. Our whole group felt that these animals should be 
relocated or the facility seriously upgraded.</span></font></span></span></h6><h6 class="uiStreamMessage userContentWrapper"><span class="messageBody"><span class="userContent"><font><span style="font-weight:normal"></span></font> <font style="font-weight:normal" size="2">Pete Steward and Radhika Timbadia</font><br>
