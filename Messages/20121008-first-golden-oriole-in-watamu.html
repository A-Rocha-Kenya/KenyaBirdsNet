  <pre>Palearctic Migrants certainly seem to arrive here at the coast later 
than inland. I had my first Euro Bee-eater only a week ago (and none 
others since tho&#39; some visiting birders saw some when they were out), 
Barn Swallows are still not around - I&#39;ve seen one, only... but today we 
did have a beaut male Eurasian Golden Oriole on our nature trail at 
Mwamba, the A Rocha Kenya centre on the beach front in Watamu.

News on the Roseate Terns is that they did in fact succeed in breeding 
on Kisite, albeit a bit later than expected. Martin visited last week 
and estimated 1,500 fledged young and managed to ring 18 pulli and saw 
one fledged juv Sooty Tern proving that they also bred (though perhaps 
just the one pair??) on the island.

He also did some birding around Shimoni and saw a Cut-throat Finch which 
is new for the area.

We ringed in Arabuko-Sokoke Forest for Spotted Ground Thrush last week - 
didn&#39;t catch any, but did get East Coast Akalat and best of all was four 
Chestnut-fronted Helmetshrikes in the nets - the first I&#39;ve managed to 
catch though they are commonly seen of course. Had a Crowned Eagle 
displaying high overhead during the morning and there is a pair of 
Wahlberg&#39;s breeding near Gede in an msufi tree.

Golden Pipits are out in force at Sabaki but nothing else to report from 
there but a Black-winged Stilt reported from Mida Creek by the leading 
bird guide there, Juma, is very unusual for the creek.

..and yesterday the Bat Hawk appeared briefly over our home next to 
Garoda hotel in the early evening...
