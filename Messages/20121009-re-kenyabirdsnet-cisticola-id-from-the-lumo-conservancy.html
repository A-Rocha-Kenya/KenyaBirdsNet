&gt; later I finally have the time to process my photos! I have these images of
&gt; a cisticola we initially though was Desert Cisticola, but now I am not
&gt; sure. From the illustrations in Zimmerman and S&amp;F it looks like it could
&gt; also be Ashy or Siffling Cisticola. I cannot see a plain rufous rump or
&gt; black tail with white-tips which suggests that it is not a Desert Cisticola
&gt; and it is outside of the range for a Pectoral-patch Cisticola.
&gt; Unfortunately it was so long ago that I can&#39;t remember the song.

&gt; Does anyone know which cisticola this is with a degree of certainty? It was
&gt; in a small bush (pair) in dry open grassland (&lt;1000 m), part of the wider
&gt; Tsavo ecosystem.
