received this message&nbsp; <BR>- At last everyone can now exhale!<BR>Also, i 
think KENWEB deserves a little credit in all this so&nbsp; <BR>congratulations 
everyone who gave selflessly their time, information,&nbsp; <BR>maps, 
connections, writing skills and editing for the RIS. Whereas for&nbsp; <BR>some 
this is an end and a cause for celebration, i think its just a&nbsp; 
<BR>beginning for the Tana Delta, here comes the daunting task of a&nbsp; 
<BR>management plan. Lets not leave it to the 
hounds!<BR><BR>Wanja<BR><BR><BR>From: Judith Nyunja

members of the Kenya Wetlands&nbsp; <BR>Forum for the support they have provided 
in the process of designating&nbsp; <BR>Tana Delta Ramsar Site.<BR>The long 
journey is finally over as we celebrate Kenyaâ??s 6th Ramsar site.<BR>We look 
forward to continue working together with our conservation&nbsp; <BR>partners, 
develop and implement management structures for the Tana&nbsp; <BR>delta as we 
embrace the principle of â??wise useâ? of wetlands for&nbsp; <BR>sustainable 
development.<BR><BR>Please circulate this to the KWF members.<BR>Kind

added to the Ramsar List<BR><BR>The Secretariat is very pleased to announce that 
Kenya has designated&nbsp; <BR>the Tana River Delta as a Wetland of 
International Importance. As&nbsp; <BR>summarized by Ramsarâ??s MS Ako Charlotte 
Eyong, from the accompanying&nbsp; <BR>RIS, the Tana River Delta Ramsar Site 
(163,600 hectares, 02Â°27â??S&nbsp; <BR>040Â°17â??E), an Important Bird Area 
(IBA) in Coast Province, is the&nbsp; <BR>second most important estuarine and 
deltaic ecosystem in Eastern&nbsp; <BR>Africa, comprising a variety of 
freshwater, floodplain, estuarine and&nbsp; <BR>coastal habitats with extensive 
and diverse mangrove systems, marine&nbsp; <BR>brackish and freshwater 
intertidal areas, pristine beaches and shallow&nbsp; <BR>marine areas, forming 
productive and functionally interconnected&nbsp; <BR>ecosystems.<BR><BR>This 
diversity in habitats permits diverse hydrological functions and&nbsp; <BR>a 
rich biodiversity including coastal and marine prawns, shrimps,&nbsp; 
<BR>bivalves and fish, five species of threatened marine turtles and IUCN&nbsp; 
<BR>red-listed African elephant (Loxodonta africana), Tana Mangabey&nbsp; 
<BR>(Cercocebus galeritus), Tana River Red Colobus (Procolobus&nbsp; 
<BR>rufomitratus rufomitratus) and White-collared Monkey (Cercopithecus&nbsp; 
<BR>mitis albotorquatus). Over 600 plant species have been identified,&nbsp; 
<BR>including the endangered Cynometra lukei and Gonatopus 
marattioides.<BR><BR>As one of the only estuarine staging posts on the West Asia 
- Eastern&nbsp; <BR>Africa coastal flyway, it is a critical feeding and 
wintering ground&nbsp; <BR>for several migratory waterbirds such as waders, 
gulls and terns. The&nbsp; <BR>main human activities include fishing, 
small-scale family-oriented&nbsp; <BR>agriculture, mangrove wood exploitation, 
grazing, water supply,&nbsp; <BR>tourism and research (ongoing research on the 
protection and&nbsp; <BR>monitoring of breeding turtles and the conservation of 
dugongs).<BR><BR>Kenya presently has six Ramsar Sites, covering an area of 
265,449 hectares.<BR><BR>Best regards, Dwight Peck,
