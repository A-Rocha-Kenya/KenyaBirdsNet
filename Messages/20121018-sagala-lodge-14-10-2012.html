  <div class="mtl fbDocument"><p>Here is the list from a brief afternoon visit to Sagala Lodge, 
Sunday 14th October, not quite migration but birding is starting to pick
 up there, should be excellent in Nov/Dec. The birding highlight for us 
was a Red-fronted Warbler, we&#39;d only ever seen this at Baringo before (now we are familiar with them I bet I see them everywhere!). Other interest was a male Von der Deckans Hornbill eating a huge centipede and a Black-shouldered Kite harassing a Eastern Pale Goshawk. I
 think there was at least one other swift species present but I am no 
expert at swifts so it remains unknown. The resident Spotted-eagle Owl had been seen by others the same day.</p><p>I have attempted to attached two dodgy images (this usually goes wrong!) of a distant Black-cheeked Waxbill, the area of black on the chin looks rather small hence we chose Black-cheeked rather than female Black-faced but if anyone has a different opinion we&#39;d love to know. The photos are of the same bird.<br>
</p><p></p><p></p>
<p>The lodge is under new management but I was assured the rates are the
 same. Unfortunately the roof of the platform viewing the waterhole has 
now collapsed, still there&#39;s a place to sit.</p><p></p>Happy birding,<br><br>Pete &amp; Radhika<br>
