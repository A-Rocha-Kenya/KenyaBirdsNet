  <pre>My first record of two southern banded snake eagle perching on a dead branch of a tree. here at Wema the indigeous forest streatch from Wema to Vumbe village seems to host some rare birds species where no records have been listed.
Though for the moment i do see my birds but fear to carry my Bino due to GSU carrying operation at ground. most of time i feel i am lucking one of my organ to be complete. 
Lots of birds with breeding behavior feeding and forming groups as they fly together.
Good birding Time.
