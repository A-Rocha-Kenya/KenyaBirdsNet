  Dear All,<div><br></div><div>Just to let you know that the passage of PWNJ continues at Sala&#39;s with one male and a female last night. Weather and light both poor so no improvement on the images but its looking promising for tonight! </div>
<div><br></div><div>Once again, both birds headed south into Serengeti after 5-10 mins of hawking and showing off!</div><div><br></div><div>Also a fine Ovambo Sparrowhawk over camp yesterday which obliged for some nice pics despite being bombarded by hirundines.</div>
<div><br></div><div>Cheers,</div><div>Adam  </div>
