  <div>Dear Birders &amp; Ringers,</div><div> </div><div>I thought it might be worth sharing a recapture info with you. This is a <strong>Blacksmith Plover</strong> who was ringed by a team led by Dr. Peter Njoroge of the Orrnithology Section, NMK at Hippo Point, Lake Naivasha on 27th May 2005.</div>


<div> </div><div>I caught the plover again in South Kinangop (off Magumu-Njabini highway along Kenyatta Rd, St. Mary&#39;s Village) on Tue, 16 Oct. 2012. The plover had thus travelled <strong>c.38.3 Km</strong> (23.8 miles) and has lived for a period of <strong>4 years, 4 months and 19 days</strong> (or thereabout) between the two captures. It was initially ringed as an adult. I am sure many questions arises from this observation and needs to be answered.</div>
<div> </div><div>I know there are birds that would move and live longer distances but this is one rare occurence (given the thousands of local birds that are ringed annualy). I trust that many of you who are ringing birds all over Kenya would send/share their recapture data with the Museum so that we can get to know our birds better.</div>
