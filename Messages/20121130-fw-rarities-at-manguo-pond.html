  <pre>Just like during January 2003 a follow up on Ferruginous Duck brings up also
a Gadwall!

Well done and hope can catch up with these rarities.

I&#39;d rather go birding...

Dear All,
I just wanted to get this out as there is a weekend coming up, and the birds
are there.
Mike Davidson, Nigel Hunter, Karen Plumbe and myself, went up to Manguo
Pond, Limuru to try and see Adam Kennedys Ferruginous Duck.
The first bird watched was a female Gadwall swimming along the island,
followed by the Ferruginous Duck, which is not fully chestnut yet, but still
good colour, and of course the staring white-eye and not yet gleaming white
undertail coverts. Whilst these were performing there was a grey Western
Reef Heron roosting on the island as well. More details will come later of
other species present, but these are the most important for the present.
Best to all
Brian
