This spectacular bird has been on our school grounds for the past week, being very vocal as well. I have heard there are some others by the Kijabe Mission Hospital but have not confirmed it. I have not seen these here before, anyone else have records of them either in the Rift (near Longonot) or on the eastern escarpment? <br><br>A few weeks ago I also discovered 3 Cape Eagle-Owls roosting on some cliffs in the Forest. <br> 		 	   		  </div></body>
