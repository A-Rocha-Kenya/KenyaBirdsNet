  <pre>A trip to Nairobi National Park was a memorable way to finish 2012.

Highlights included Kori Bustard, immature Great Spotted Cuckoo eating a
bristly caterpillar, Pied Wheatear and Whinchat.

Best of all was a life mammal for me: an Aardwolf! It greeted a Jackal who
was trotting down the road, then foraged in the grass near the car, allowing
good views.

Wishing you good birding and a peaceful new year, Fleur
