  <pre>Hi James,
I am glad you have brought this to our notice, CMC needs to think abit more before 
they do this sort of thing. If they thought the trees unsafe they should have got 
further advice, if the trees were not unsafe, and driving past they don&#39;t appear to be 
unsafe, then they shouldn&#39;t do it.
I hope someone will contact CMC top management.

Great to see the Booted Eagle and Common Buzzard.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I happened to pass along Lusaka Road, within the sprawling Nairobi&#39;s Industrial Area yesterday. 
&gt; 
&gt; The Cooper Motors Corporation (CMC) management, had brought down four mature trees (Acacia sp.), which, was an active nesting site for Marabou Storks and Weaver birds. In the event, they killed dozen full of the nestlings and fledglings.
&gt; 
&gt; Was that fare? That act left me pondering if CMC have a corporate conservation policy.
&gt; 
&gt; On a brighter note, whilst, in attendance of a friends burial in Ngararia, Murang&#39;a County, I saw two migratory raptors soaring. They were Booted Eagle and Common Buzzard.
&gt; 
&gt; Have a great birding weekend.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; JKN
