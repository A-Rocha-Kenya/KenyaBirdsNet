  Hi all<br><br><b>Weaver Wednesdays</b><br><br>Want to know more about different weaver species? Bookmark <a href="http://weavers.adu.org.za">http://weavers.adu.org.za</a> where, every Wednesday, one species will be covered with interesting information and illustrations. To see a list of species already covered, see <a href="http://weavers.adu.org.za/species.php">http://weavers.adu.org.za/species.php</a><br>
<br><b>Weaver colony sizes</b><div><br>Relatively little is known about weaver colony sizes, and even less about seasonal and annual changes in colony sizes. <br><br>By contributing regular PHOWN (PHOtos of Weaver Nests, <a href="http://weavers.adu.org.za/phown.php">http://weavers.adu.org.za/phown.php</a>) records, the PHOWN database can start to provide insights into colony sizes of weavers.<br>
Choose a weaver colony near to your home or work that you can monitor on a regular basis. The suggested interval for repeats is weekly, but you can submit repeats on a daily, monthly or random basis (although regular is best).<br>
If you have already participated, note that you save your colony in the gazetteer, making it even quicker and easier to submit repeat records, than submitting new records.<br><br>If you have not taken part yet, you can start now! You can also register your colony (for repeats) by sending me an email, but registration is not necessary - just send records.<br>
Single records are still valuable too!<br><br>Read more about Repeats at <a href="http://weavers.adu.org.za/phownrepeat.php">http://weavers.adu.org.za/phownrepeat.php</a><br><br>* PHOWN is a Virtual Museum, citizen science project of the Animal Demography Unit, to collect and monitor breeding distributions and colony sizes of weaver birds globally.<br>
