  <pre>Thanks Colin,
It would be interesting to learn if there are quite a number of
WFscops in the cashew plantations, I don&#39;t think there is too much
else, but you never know if you don&#39;t look.
Glad you saw the Violet-breasted Sunbirds, I estimated there were 100
birds at least moving between the flowering Combretums. As we know so
little about this species, because there was a constant flow of birds
arriving and departing at bush height, I thought that if this happens
again next mid-April it would be interesting to ring them. It would
help to estimate numbers as well as hopefully lead to controls in the
future. I don&#39;t think you would get a recovery but you never know. Can
you send me a photo of the bird you caught at Mwamba. I have never
ever seen a good photograph of the species, although I did get some
nice video of them back in April. Amazingly on my July tour there was
a male at the lily pond near the Sabaki Bridge.
Very best for now
Brian

&gt; Hi Brian,
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for this. The White-faced has not infrequently been brought into
&gt; Bio-Ken snake farm as chicks or injured adults and talking to locals around
&gt; here, it does not seem uncommon in farmland in behind Gede and around
&gt; Malindi. It seems to survive even in cashewnut plantations, surprisingly. I
&gt; will see if we can get out and get some recordings of its call... I&#39;ll talk
&gt; to David Ngala about it as he should have more information. I guess people
&gt; have not recorded it as not many birders go birding in cashew nut shambas!!
&gt; I confess I don&#39;t - tho perhaps I should! - though I have thought several
&gt; times about doing bird surveys in farmland as it would be very interesting
&gt; to do that esp in conjunction with an indigenous tree-planting programme in
&gt; the community... When we have more capacity in A Rocha Kenya, we&#39;ll do it!
&gt;
&gt; Yes, I did get to see the Violet-breasted at Sabaki - awesome. We even
&gt; caught and ringed a male here at Mwamba which we put photos of up on our A
&gt; Rocha Kenya facebook page.
&gt;
&gt; Best,
&gt;

&gt;&gt; Hi Colin,
&gt;&gt; Good that Broad-bills have already made an entry. Little Stints may be
&gt;&gt; inland at present, there were over 500 at Bogoria at a roosting area
&gt;&gt; near the main entrance, which including an intriguing one with a white
&gt;&gt; rump which I photographed.
&gt;&gt; Am interested by the White-faced Scops Owl, which would be a southern.
&gt;&gt; They have a far more dramatic call than Northern, and it is surprising
&gt;&gt; that if they were more numerous than records suggest then people would
&gt;&gt; be hearing them. I have only ever seen the species twice in Kenya
&gt;&gt; (having heard them first), both times the same valley near Eremit off
&gt;&gt; the Oltepesi Road, which comes off the Magadi Road. How often have you
&gt;&gt; come across them?
&gt;&gt; Did you ever get down to Sabaki mid April to see all the
&gt;&gt; Violet-breasted Sunbirds on the Combretums?
&gt;&gt; Best for now
&gt;&gt; Brian

&gt;&gt; &gt; Just back from a waterfowl count at Sabaki River Mouth. Reasonable
&gt;&gt; &gt; numbers of birds though very few Little Stints which was surprising.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Mangroves are invading even faster and sand continues to fill in the
&gt;&gt; &gt; soft, deeper mud thus reducing the area available for waders to feed.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Having said that, it may be expanding further south - we need to do a
&gt;&gt; &gt; proper GIS project on it to really understand what is going on.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Birds of interest were:
&gt;&gt; &gt; - Broad-billed Sandpiper have returned (last month we saw none) with
&gt;&gt; &gt; c.25 counted (totals being tallied still)
&gt;&gt; &gt; - Peregrine - 1 adult flew over disturbing all the waders and headed
&gt;&gt; &gt; off
&gt;&gt; &gt; north. Probably a male judging by the size
&gt;&gt; &gt; - almost 300 whistling duck - both White-fronted &amp; Fulvous
&gt;&gt; &gt; - 3 Knob-billed Duck
&gt;&gt; &gt; - 1 Af Open-billed Stork on the river and a further 5 in the
&gt;&gt; &gt; lily-covered pool by the bridge
&gt;&gt; &gt; - best bird was an adult Palmnut Vulture - my first record for Sabaki
&gt;&gt; &gt; - Black Heron - doing his umbrella fishing act in the pool by the
&gt;&gt; &gt; bridge
&gt;&gt; &gt; - Grey-headed Kingfisher
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Very few gulls and terns today - a few Common and Saunders and one
&gt;&gt; &gt; Caspian Tern.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Other records of note from the Mida Creek Bird Club:
&gt;&gt; &gt; 3rd Sept - single African Skimmer - a new species for Mida Creek as far
&gt;&gt; &gt; as I am aware
&gt;&gt; &gt; 7th Sept - single Eurasian Oystercatcher
&gt;&gt; &gt; 16th Sept - 6 Pink-backed Pelicans (not at all common at Mida)
&gt;&gt; &gt; 17th Sept - White-faced Scops Owl - this species is probably far
&gt;&gt; &gt; commoner around here than is suggested in the literature
