  <hr/>
  <pre>On 20th May, Nigel Hunter and myself went down the Magadi Road. It was a
very overcast start, but the fine weather was only just over the brow of the
Ngongs below Corner Baridi. We did not stop along the descent until Ol
Tepesi. The road that Mike, Karen and I took last Saturday was now muddy and
not too safe. We had a look at the dams at the bottom of the last hill
before the town, and there were four Red-billed Buffalo-Weavers, which is an
inexplicably rare visitor to the area. The first of countless Singing
Bush-Larks were singing and displaying over the grassland and it eventuated
as one of the commonest species seen. The first of the Harlequin Quail were
heard, and these too were common all through the lowland area, and finally
thousands upon thousands of Chestnut Weavers have moved in and were
“sizzling” from every group of bushes. An interesting thing is that most
were adult males, with rather few females. There were also two Common
Buttonquail calling from cover. The previous week we only recorded one
Harlequin Quail, and no Singing Bush-Larks or Chestnut Weavers. Also Wattled
Starling had moved in and the males were in arresting breeding plumage and
singing from the trees (if it can be called singing). Additionally there
were five Jacobin Cuckoos, and many Diederics, whilst we heard three
Red-chested and one Black Cuckoo. We found most of the usual species in the
scrub, and there were several bustling Lesser Masked Weaver colonies along
the road.
Vitellines and Black-necked were also busy nesting.
Any grassy and bushy area had bountiful Cardinal Queleas, and Entonosura,
not far past the Ol Kejo River gorge had two Fire-fronted and one Southern
Red Bishop in breeding plumage. Another inexplicably scarce species recorded
here was a family of Rufous Chatterers. The water that had extensively
flooded the plains here, was flowing fast and for over 500m there was a
stretch of water nearly two foot deep covering the main road to Magadi. We
turned around at this point, and headed back uphill.
Other interesting observations in the lowlands were a Rufous-crowned Roller
excavating a hole in the sheer bank of the Ol Kejo gorge, and Abyssinian
Scimitarbills nesting in a bark crevice in an Acacia tortilis.
When on the return, exactly at the sign that says Magadi 60km/Kiserian 23km,
we heard a Pringle’s Puffback call, and went to video it.
This is such a neglected bird since I first found it some twenty-years ago,
and brought its existence to local attention. With the horrendous and
continuous (and illegal), removal of bush cover for charcoal, the bird has
lost so much habitat. The form that is unique here is undoubtedly an
undescribed form, and is an endemic race of the (thought monotypic)
Pringle’s Puffback, to the Ngong slopes. It was essential to get some video
of a live bird before there are none left.
Unlike the black and dark grey backed nominate Pringle’s Puffback, the males
of this form are dazzling white and silver. The only black on the bird is
the shiny cap which extends as a thin line down the nape whilst the back
(always black and dark-grey in Pringles) is silvery grey and white. The base
of the tail is black, but the inner tail feathers are slaty grey. The
remainder of the bird is so dazzling and clean silver-grey and white.
We succeeded in getting excellent video of the bird feeding, though there
was no sign of a female (perhaps on a nest, hopefully). Whilst videoing this
we flushed a nightjar from under the acacias. After leaving the Pringle’s,
we managed to flush the bird four more times, but could never locate it on
the ground in the very dense cover. The most distinctive feature was a very
short tail with all white outer edges to the outer tail feathers. Whilst the
views were brief, the impression gained was of a Square-tailed Nightjar,
though the record is inconclusive. Possibly a winter visitor from further
south.
According to Britton, it has been recorded north to Olorgesaillie in the
past.


Magadi Road is so green and attractive, that apart from the potholes, it is
a beautiful drive along the road, and there are so many birds to entertain.

There is a series of grabs of the Puffback, taken from the video and
attached to this email.

Finally we met, and spent nearly an hour with Philip Nkaka who saw us
birding and came to see what we were doing. He is the Senior Chief for the
Oldonyio-Nyokie Location. This is a huge area which extends from Sampu and
the foot of the Ngurumans, Lake Kwenia as far as Ol Kilinito (Miley 46/Kudu
Hills). Now the important point as well as him being a very pleasant
individual that speaks very good English, is that he is a conservationist
and will not allow any charcoal burning or removal of the bush under his
control. His people are instructed to remove Prosopis from their region when
they come across it. He made us very welcome, and we said there are many
people that enjoy birding in his area, and said they were most welcome. He
offered to come out with birding parties. He said he would show us Kora
Forest (where the elephants are), and another lake, not so far away that is
larger than Lake Kwenia. If anyone is going to the area, and wishes to show
support for his conservationist policies, he would be very pleased to meet
them. This reads like he is looking for financial assistance, but this was
not the case. His telephone (Mobile) is 0724 487 298, and address P.O. Box
19, Magadi.


Best to all Brian
