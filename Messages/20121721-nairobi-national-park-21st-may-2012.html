  <pre>Dear All,
Mike Davidson, Heather Elkin, Jennifer Oduori, Karen Plumbe and myself met up at the Main Gate to Nairobi National Park at 6.30am and were soon through the gate.
The weather was very bright and cheerful, and remained so all morning but never got too warm. There had been no rain the previous night, most roads were drier than last Monday, but Hyena and Langata Dams seemed more full.

We started off at KWS Mess gardens, there was a good variety here, but the better birds were both Green-backed (Eastern) and Wahlberg&#39;s Honeybirds, with yet another Wahlberg&#39;s along the back road to Hyena Dam.
There was nothing at Ivory Burning Site, although a single Nairobi Pipit was on the road just before there, and it was quiet along the back road, apart from a pair of Red-billed Teal on the floodings. At Hyena Dam we had an obliging couple of African Water Rails. Taking the run-off road the surprise of the morning was a late Sooty Falcon flying overhead, and the three species of Widowbirds have at last been joined by a few Cardinal Queleas that were setting up territories, and a Long-crested Eagle was along the Mokoyeti, and last weeks Fan-tailed Grassbird was singing from dense cover. There was an adult Fish Eagle over Nagalomon Dam, and the two immature Spotted Thick-knees were on the drift there.
We had a detour up to Imapala Lookout, and there was a female Paradise Whydah feeding on the ground here. This is the Parks third record of the species, the other two were adult males. On the Langata dam were a pair of breeding plumaged Little Grebes and a stunning adult Lesser Moorhen. Not the adult that was at Hyena Dam two weeks before, but a much brighter individual that had a very bright bill with extensive red on the upper mandible.
A few African Black Swifts were flying over Kisembe Forest,  and an attractive adult Black-chested Snake-Eagle was over Kingfisher Picnic Site. Just down the road from here was a Lilac-breasted Roller sitting in the same place as it was the previous Monday. Over grassland there was a feeding frenzy of aerial feeders, the Little and White-rumped Swifts were joined by several Mottled, and the Lesser Striped and Red-rumped Swallows were joined by a very late Barn Swallow that lacked tail-streamers.
BWF had to be out of the Park by lunch-time, but the rest of the group stayed on, and found a Jacobin Cuckoo, and a pair of more Spotted Thicknees with two small chicks under a bush on the tarmac down from Nagalomon Dam.

Still much of interest visiting, and a great morning with superb weather.

Best to all
Brian
