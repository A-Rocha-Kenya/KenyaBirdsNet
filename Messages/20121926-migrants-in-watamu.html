  <pre>We&#39;ve just had our second rain of the year - the first being 3 weeks ago 
on Easter w/e. Migrants have been apparent throughout and it has been an 
amazing year for Marsh Warblers - we&#39;ve now ringed over 20 of them 
whilst in previous years I&#39;ve only ever caught 3-4. You can hear them 
&#39;tchrrrrk&#39;-ing in the bushes all over.

Also unusual has been many Asian Lesser Cuckoos - my first real records 
for the beach front were a bird on Sunday and a further two on Tues 24th 
(one of which flew just past the end of a mist net!) and another just 
now in our garden as I&#39;ve been sitting working at my desk... (26th).

Afrotrops have started to arrive as well with the first being Af Pygmy 
Kingfisher 2 weeks ago and yesterday we ringed the first Mangrove 
Kingfisher. No Red-capped Robin Chats here yet but two Paradise 
Flycatchers ringed on Tues were the first in many months and I suspect 
must be migrants as well.

Waders are seriously reduced in number with many having left already.

Happy birding.
