  <pre>Hi all

Preliminary data indicates that colony sizes of Village Weavers may be
larger closer to the equator, ie that there is a latitudinal effect,
but much more data is needed, particularly from the tropics. There are
a fair number of records from the eastern coast of South Africa.

Please submit records to PHOWN - Photos of Weaver Nests,
http://weavers.adu.org.za/phown.php (records for any weaver species
are also welcome).
All that is needed once you are registered, is a photo (max 3 per
colony), gps coordinates, date, and a nest count.
If you want more info on how to submit records, email me or see
http://weavers.adu.org.za/phown_public.php

To see how colony sizes vary by latitude for Village Weavers, see
http://weavers.adu.org.za/pr_sbw.php
As new records are accepted in PHOWN, this web page will be updated
automatically.

Dieter
