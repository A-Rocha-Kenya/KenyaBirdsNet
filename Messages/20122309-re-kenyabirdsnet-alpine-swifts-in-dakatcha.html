  <pre>Dear Fleur,
Edwin Selempo and I had a similar instance though only six birds at
Amboseli Main Gate, in June. Birds were landing on the tower and
investigating the structure, but nothing became of it. I have video to
prove it though!
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Exciting start to a survey to search for Clarkeâ€™s Weaver:
&gt;
&gt; Some 150 Alpine Swifts circling around the Safaricom tower at Marafa in
&gt; Dakatcha Woodland, Magarini District. They were calling and seemed to be
&gt; investigating it as a nesting site; but surely a telephone tower does not
&gt; provide nesting sites? I can still hear them calling from the Nature Kenya
&gt; office in Marafa.
&gt;
&gt; Wishing you good birding, Fleur
