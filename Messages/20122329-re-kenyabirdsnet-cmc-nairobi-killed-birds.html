    Before there is too much of a furore about this, it would be good to
    confirm if it <i>was</i> CMC who cut the trees. I passed by there
    on Tuesday and saw the trees had gone - but it's not all the trees,
    nor is it necessarily the trees that are closest to CMC. Marabous
    are still nesting on the remaining trees in fact. The main tree that
    was cut is the huge one on the roundabout and talking with the taxi
    driver about it, he said it was because the roundabout is going to
    be removed and a fly-over put in to ease traffic congestion.<br>
    <br>
    This sounds more plausible to me, in fact, particularly as I say
    that the trees nearest CMC are still standing <i>and</i> have
    Marabous nesting on them still...<br>

              &gt;&gt; Dear CMC,<br>
              &gt;&gt;<br>
              &gt;&gt; It was recently observed by a member of the
              Kenyan Birdwatching community<br>
              &gt;&gt; that you have removed several trees that were
              used by nesting Marabou<br>
              &gt;&gt; Storks. In the process several birds were killed
              and left to die on the<br>
              &gt;&gt; street. I find that kind of flagrant disregard
              for the welfare of birds<br>
              &gt;&gt; /<br>
              &gt;&gt; animal life rather sickening and it makes me
              wonder what other kind of<br>
              &gt;&gt; morally questionable things your company gets up
              to. I am not a wealthy<br>
              &gt;&gt; person so the loss of my business may be of no
              more consequence to you<br>
              &gt;&gt; than<br>
              &gt;&gt; the loss of a Marabou nest. Just the same I can
              assure you that there are<br>
              &gt;&gt; hundreds of others who feel as I do and who would
              like to see your<br>
              &gt;&gt; company<br>
              &gt;&gt; move forward with a bit more of a sense of
              decency and respect for the<br>
              &gt;&gt; natural world.<br>
              &gt;&gt;<br>
              &gt;&gt; Sincerely,<br>
              &gt;&gt;<br>
