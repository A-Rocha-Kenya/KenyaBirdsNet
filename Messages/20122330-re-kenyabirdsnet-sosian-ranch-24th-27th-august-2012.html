  Hi Brian,<div dir="ltr">Here at our tents we are at 1692 m, roughly the same as most of mpala and soit nyiro. Our property then descends down to the ewaso nyiro river across from mpala. We are though a small bit closer to the steep lugga system that drains north towards the low country around kipsing and samburu. I suspect that this helps us get some of the northern / eastern or low country species that appear on us but may not on the west side of the ewaso. Gerenuk and lesser kudu are also on our property but for the most part do not appear on that part of mpala opposite us (only a very few gerenuk have been recorded there but they are thick thick thick on our side). I have sometimes wondered if the competition from impala  on the west side <span class="Apple-style-span" style>(lots of impala on mpala)</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style> allows the river to behave as a more inhibiting geographical boundary than it would be otherwise. Magpie starlings also appear on us from time to time. Come stay when you are next in the neighborhood. Cheers, jamie<span></span></span></div>

Thanks so much for all these details, it helps paint a clearer picture<br>
of the species distribution and frequency. What is the altitude you<br>
are finding these at?<br>
Best for now<br>

&gt; Somali tits, or what i have always called northern grey are very common<br>
&gt; with us.<br>
&gt; Black-capped social weavers are common with us and also I believe that<br>
&gt; Darcy Ogada recorded a dark chanting goshawk on mpala not very long back.<br>
&gt; Some other notes:<br>
&gt; Currently a fischers starling flock on us - they usually only come to us<br>
&gt; once a year. Our golden-breasted starlings have been seen at the same<br>
&gt; location so many times that I suspect they may have even bred. Our two<br>
&gt; flocks of scaly chatterers are still about and I have found one more pair<br>
&gt; of Pringles puffback. I must be overlooking others but I found my first<br>
&gt; tiny cisticola on us recently despite running into them frequently in<br>
&gt; steeper country west of the ewaso nyiro. Cheers,<br>

&gt;&gt; Sorry Tom,<br>
&gt;&gt; I forgot you were still in Saudi. I will wait until you get back. I<br>
&gt;&gt; will write to Quentin to ask him what they do not recognise tirion<br>
&gt;&gt; from, as it has to be something.<br>
&gt;&gt; Very best for now<br>

&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi Brian,<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I am in Saudi Arabia...and my Soita Nyiro Conservancy Bird  List is<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; back<br>
&gt;&gt; in<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Kenya...hard copy only.  I have seen the Somali Tit at  SNC...but seems<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; uncommon.  Never seen Grey-backed Fiscal there.  Would  have to check<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; my<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; bird<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; list to say if I have recorded Dark Chanting Goshawk  there. Please<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; note<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; that<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I have not had a whole lot of time to do much birding on<br>
&gt;&gt;  SNC...especially<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; over the last 3 years.  As such, there are likely a good  number of<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; bird<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; species that I have yet to tally!<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Quentin says that the plant authorities do not recognize  Acacia<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; tirion.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Cheers,<br>

&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi  Tom&#39;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks for this, maybe it is moving in. Have you recorded Somali  Tit,<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Dark Chanting Goshawk or Grey-backed Fiscal. I think in the case  of<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; the latter, it has probably been seen before but the relevency  was<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; never recognised.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Any word from Quentin on Acacia tirion (do you  have it on Mpala?),  I<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; know he is relaxing on the coast this  week.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; We also collected the Vepris for him,  that lives on a kopje  on<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Sosian, which has white fruits when ripe rather than red. It  was<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; identified there as simplicifolia, but apart from white fruits,  the<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; leaves are trifoliate. Any ideas. Leaves and fruit are in  Nigels<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; fridge on Quentins instructions.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Best for now<br>

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I read your below account with great  interest!   Thanks!<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; BTW, the Black-capped Social  Weaver is, at least seasonally, a<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fairly<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; common bird at my  feeder at Soita Nyiro Conservancy...an enclave<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; within<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Mpala<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  Conservancy...on the Ewaso Nyiro River....several kms SE of  Sosian.<br>
