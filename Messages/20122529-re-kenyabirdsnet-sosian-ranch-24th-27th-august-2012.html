  <pre>Sorry Tom,
I forgot you were still in Saudi. I will wait until you get back. I
will write to Quentin to ask him what they do not recognise tirion
from, as it has to be something.
Very best for now
Brian

&gt; Hi Brian,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I am in Saudi Arabia...and my Soita Nyiro Conservancy Bird  List is back in
&gt;
&gt; Kenya...hard copy only.  I have seen the Somali Tit at  SNC...but seems
&gt; uncommon.  Never seen Grey-backed Fiscal there.  Would  have to check my
&gt; bird
&gt; list to say if I have recorded Dark Chanting Goshawk  there. Please note
&gt; that
&gt; I have not had a whole lot of time to do much birding on  SNC...especially
&gt; over the last 3 years.  As such, there are likely a good  number of bird
&gt; species that I have yet to tally!
&gt;
&gt; Quentin says that the plant authorities do not recognize  Acacia tirion.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;

&gt; Hi  Tom&#39;
&gt; Thanks for this, maybe it is moving in. Have you recorded Somali  Tit,
&gt; Dark Chanting Goshawk or Grey-backed Fiscal. I think in the case  of
&gt; the latter, it has probably been seen before but the relevency  was
&gt; never recognised.
&gt; Any word from Quentin on Acacia tirion (do you  have it on Mpala?),  I
&gt; know he is relaxing on the coast this  week.
&gt; We also collected the Vepris for him,  that lives on a kopje  on
&gt; Sosian, which has white fruits when ripe rather than red. It  was
&gt; identified there as simplicifolia, but apart from white fruits,  the
&gt; leaves are trifoliate. Any ideas. Leaves and fruit are in  Nigels
&gt; fridge on Quentins instructions.
&gt; Best for now

&gt;&gt; Hi  Brian,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I read your below account with great  interest!   Thanks!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; BTW, the Black-capped Social  Weaver is, at least seasonally, a  fairly
&gt;&gt; common bird at my  feeder at Soita Nyiro Conservancy...an enclave within
&gt;&gt; Mpala
&gt;&gt;  Conservancy...on the Ewaso Nyiro River....several kms SE of  Sosian.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I suspect that James Christian has found the same at  his place  (Karisia
&gt;&gt; Conservancy) a few kms up river from Soita  Nyiro.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Best wishes,
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt; Dear All,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  Nigel and Julia Hunter and myself had the opportunity  to have four days
&gt;&gt;
&gt;  at
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Sosian Ranch on Western Laikipia. Apart from a few  rainy  spells Nigel
&gt; and
&gt;&gt; I were birding most of the daylight  hours, and the mornings  were always
&gt;&gt; sparkling and fresh. During  the two full days we managed to record  just
&gt;&gt; over
&gt;&gt; 200  species which is not bad when there were only six palearctics
&gt; included
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; in the total. In addition there were some remarkably  common species
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt; went unrecorded.
&gt;&gt; Whilst driving  about nine kilometers north of  Rumuruti, I asked Nigel
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; stop  the car as I thought I could hear Grey-backed  Fiscal singing, and
&gt;&gt;
&gt; I
&gt;&gt; had
&gt;&gt; never heard of one east of the Rift before. Sure   enough there was a
&gt;&gt; Grey-backed Fiscal, and we had two more singles  near eleven  kilometers
&gt;&gt; north. On
&gt;&gt; the return we were  keeping an eye (and ear) open for them  as we bumped
&gt;&gt; along the  road back to Rumuruti. We saw seven birds from nine
&gt;&gt; kilometers
&gt;&gt;  out,
&gt;&gt; with the last pair literally on the outskirts of the town.   Having been
&gt; home
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have researched the known distribution for  the species and  found the
&gt;&gt; following… Britton lists them in the  Rift at Baringo, Nakuru to
&gt;&gt; Naivasha
&gt;&gt; with
&gt;&gt; the farthest  eastern being Lake Solai. Stevenson et al. give no  eastern
&gt;&gt;  records, Lewis and Pomeroy’s “A Bird Atlas of Kenya,” did not list
&gt;&gt;  Grey-back
&gt;&gt; Fiscal as ever having occurred east of the Rift, but  Zimmermann and
&gt; Turner
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; give the distribution much as the  others but adding “occasionally east
&gt; to
&gt;&gt; the Laikipia  Plateau.”  Our findings indicate that the bird is now a
&gt; common
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; resident between Rumuruti and eleven kilometers to the  north at  least.
&gt;&gt; Other interesting findings were all from Sosian.  We  had an adult Dark
&gt;&gt; Chanting Goshawk, whilst Eastern Chanting  is a common  species there.
&gt; Again
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; there is little  recorded in the literature of this  species occurring
&gt; east
&gt;&gt;  of
&gt;&gt; the Rift. Britton and Lewis &amp; Pomeroy could not  provide  one instance of
&gt;&gt;
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; species appearing east of the Rift, and  Zimmermann  &amp; Turner also could
&gt; not
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; cite a record.  The bird at Sosian until any  further evidence comes to
&gt;&gt;  light,
&gt;&gt; probably represents a wanderer, rather than  any obvious  attempt to
&gt; extend
&gt;&gt; the range eastwards. We had a lone Somali Tit,   but later in the morning
&gt;&gt; four kilometers away we ran across another.  Whether  this was the same
&gt;&gt; individual that was at great odds  relocated in another area,  or there
&gt; were
&gt;&gt; two
&gt;&gt; birds  present cannot be determined. However this was the  first time
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; species
&gt;&gt; had been seen on Sosian, and at 5,800 feet  is  remarkably high for the
&gt;&gt; species. Britton, Lewis &amp; Pomeroy  and Zimmermann  &amp; Turner all give the
&gt;&gt; distribution as north  of Laikipia, extending to  Baringo in the Rift,
&gt; and in
&gt;&gt;  the
&gt;&gt; semi-arid Somali biome south to Isiolo then  through the  Tsavos. There
&gt;&gt; appears
&gt;&gt; to be no record from the Laikipia  Plateau.  There was a Black-capped
&gt; Social
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Weaver hanging  around the lodge, as much  associating with Chestnut
&gt; Sparrows
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; as Grey-capped Social Weavers. None of  Britton,  Lewis &amp; Pomeroy or
&gt;&gt; Zimmermann &amp; Turner can give any  instance  where the species has
&gt;&gt; wandered
&gt;&gt; outside
&gt;&gt; of its  range in Kenya. The closest area  of occurrence to the north that
&gt;&gt;
&gt;  is
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; given is Barsaloi, and the closest to the  east is  Samburu. Again this
&gt; would
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; appear to be the first documented  record of  the species occurring on
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; Laikipia Plateau.
&gt;&gt;  Other observations were some ten sightings of  Buttonquails, even
&gt;&gt; though
&gt;&gt; the grass is long and lush no Harlequin Quails were  seen  or heard.
&gt;&gt; There was a single lost Pied Avocet on a small   dam.
&gt;&gt; Dusky Nightjars were very common, but no nightjars of  any  species were
&gt;&gt; calling.
&gt;&gt; Ethiopian Swallows were very numerous  over much of  the area, adults and
&gt;&gt; immatures, and one adult was  prospecting in the  office.
&gt;&gt; Barn Swallows were on the move, with  over 100 adults  clustered together
&gt;&gt;
&gt; on
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; the morning of the  26th August. No immatures were  recorded.
&gt;&gt; An amazing Mosque  Swallow, associating with normal  coloured Mosque
&gt;&gt; Swallows was  photographed alongside a very much dwarfed Lesser  Striped
&gt;&gt;  Swallow.
&gt;&gt; Instead of having the throat to chest white, and the   remainder of the
&gt;&gt; underparts rufous chestnut, it was bright  chestnut-red from  chin to
&gt; vent,
&gt;&gt; although
&gt;&gt; being early  morning there was undoubtedly an influence  of the low
&gt;&gt;  sunlight.
&gt;&gt; Just on entering the ranch I stepped out of the car   and heard some
&gt;&gt; Black-lored Babblers calling, but did not see them.  Maybe they  were
&gt; vepres,
&gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt; that would seem to be a long  way from Mt Kenya. Something to  look out
&gt; for
&gt;&gt; next time. Brown  Babbler is there, but we did not run into it on  this
&gt;&gt;  ocassion.
&gt;&gt; Everything else was much as would be expected. A   complete list of
&gt; species
&gt;&gt; recorded follows.
&gt;&gt; Best for  now
&gt;&gt; Brian
&gt;&gt; PS for the botanists. In Najma Dharani’s,  Acacia  guide, she names
&gt; several
&gt;&gt; new species of acacias. One of  these is Acacia  tirion, a very rare
&gt; species
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; confined to  the area Kabarnet-Marigat-Baringo. It  is unique in having
&gt; equal
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; armouries of spines and barbs, and is quite   formidable. This species is
&gt;&gt; abundant on Sosian in an equal abundance  with  mellifera and brevispica.
