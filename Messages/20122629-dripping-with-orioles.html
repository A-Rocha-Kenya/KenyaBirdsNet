  <pre>Just back from being away for 3 weeks and it&#39;s a great time to be on the 
north coast - the trees are literally dripping with Eurasian Golden 
Orioles and there are Euro Bee-eaters and White-throated overhead every 
few hours. Not only that but arrived to the sound of Blue-naped 
Mousebirds all over making me feel like I&#39;m in Tsavo. Still very dry but 
there are large flocks of Black-bellied Starlings all over the place and 
quite a few Violet-backed going overhead.

Waders are starting to get breeding plumage and the Greater Sands are 
getting quite fat now and are almost ready to go. Had Silvery-cheeked 
Hornbill in Malindi on Sunday which is the first I&#39;ve seen of them for a 
very long time - not sure what has happened to their population here as 
they used to be very regular. Grosbeak Weavers have also turned up again 
after also quite a long break since last recording them here on the 
beach front.

We&#39;re ringing here tomorrow in the scrub on our nature trail and I hope 
will catch a few palaearctic migrants as well...
