  <pre>One or two things to report from Watamu - a pale morph Booted Eagle just 
behind Mida on Saturday (3rd) was probably the highlight recently - 
though there was a Ruff there the same day which is also unusual. We 
ringed there last night and caught 89 waders including my first Wood 
Sandpiper for Mida. Plenty of Crab-plovers around but we didn&#39;t catch any.

Barn Swallows really have arrived along the beach front this week - a 
good passage on Monday of small groups going through every 10-20 mins 
throughout the day. Blue-cheeked Bee-eaters have been passing through in 
good numbers over the past 10 days - again flocks passing high overhead 
but vocalising nicely so you can hear them from far.

A strong passage of Common Terns at the start of the week which led to 5 
weak and exhausted ones being brought in to us together with a juv Sooty 
Tern - three of the Commons didn&#39;t make it but all the others have been 
released and flown away.

We were ringing in Arabuko-Sokoke yesterday morning for Spotted Ground 
Thrush - but there have been so few this year and we didn&#39;t catch any. A 
few East Coast Akalats however and other nice forest species.
