  <pre>Hi all yesterday was a good day for the ducks, Herons and Fish Eagle.
after morning rain around Tana Delta, I was driving arround the two neighbor  schemes.
Cattle egrets lots
African fish eagle 2 perched on the tree for two hours.
Black headed Heron
Brown Snake eagle day before at Wema Scheme
and what surprised me most was hundreds of White face whistling ducks and Comb ducks feasting on the Rice from the farms, the local had it rough as the chase them away you will see cloud of birds flashed and going down again.
what can we do to for this conflict between bird and human. it was like a game between the two.
The birds are now collecting building materials. 
White browed sparrow weaver, Golden palm weaver.
enjoy Birding
