  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" ><tr><td valign="top" style="font: inherit;">Hi all.<br>&nbsp;During a visit to Cape Town last week, I was fortunate enough to visit the STRANDFONTEIN&nbsp; Sewage Works, near Zeekoeivlei, on the outskirts of Cape Town.<br>&nbsp;More than 50% of the Cape's waterbird population is reputed to be hosted here, and is really worth a visit .<br>Transport arrangements were made by&nbsp; SHA,,&nbsp; of saashuttles, ( saashuttles@gmail.com),&nbsp; cell phone&nbsp; 0732 769 103, who comes very highly recommended.<br>Sukhy<br></td></tr></table>
