  <pre>Hi all

Recently an interesting photo was submitted to PHOWN (PHOtos of Weaver
Nests, http://weavers.adu.org.za/phown.php).
The photo is of a young python resting on the nest of a Viellot&#39;s
Black Weaver near Kigoma in Tanzania. The photo was taken by bird
guide Paul Oliver.
See the photo and details at http://weavers.adu.org.za/phown_vm.php?vm=2448
(click on large photos to get a better view; you can also follow links
to various summaries)

If you have an interesting photo relating to weaver nests, please
submit to PHOWN!
PHOWN is a citizen science project of the Animal Demography Unit, to
collect and monitor breeding distributions and colony sizes of weaver
birds globally.
