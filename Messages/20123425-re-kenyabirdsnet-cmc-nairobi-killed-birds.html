&gt;&gt; Dear CMC,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It was recently observed by a member of the Kenyan Birdwatching community
&gt;&gt; that you have removed several trees that were used by nesting Marabou
&gt;&gt; Storks.  In the process several birds were killed and left to die on the
&gt;&gt; street.  I find that kind of flagrant disregard for the welfare of birds
&gt;&gt; /
&gt;&gt; animal life  rather sickening and it makes me wonder what other kind of
&gt;&gt; morally questionable things your company gets up to.  I am not a wealthy
&gt;&gt; person so the loss of my business may be of no more consequence to you
&gt;&gt; than
&gt;&gt; the loss of a Marabou nest. Just the same I can assure you that there are
&gt;&gt; hundreds of others who feel as I do and who would like to see your
&gt;&gt; company
&gt;&gt; move forward with a bit more of a sense of decency and respect for the
&gt;&gt; natural world.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Sincerely,
&gt;&gt;
