Migrants have been moving through Nairobi during this long weekend.<BR>
<BR>
In Nairobi National Park on April 7, Sheena Orr, Darcy Ogada, Jennifer Oduori and I recorded 18 species of palaearctic migrants: Montagu's Harrier, Little Stint, Common Sandpiper, Eurasian Nightjar, Eurasian Bee-eater, Barn Swallow, Yellow Wagtail, Common Nightingale, Thrush Nightingale (Sprosser &#8211; the best view ever!), Whinchat, Northern Wheatear, Spotted Flycatcher, Eastern Olivaceous Warbler, Willow Warbler, Red-backed Shrike, Red-tailed Shrike and Lesser Grey Shrike &#8211; the three shrikes in brilliant plumage &#8211; and Tree Pipit.<BR>
<BR>
The mammal tally included 7 bushbuck, 5 suni, and a dik-dik. I believe this is the first dik-dik I have ever seen in Nairobi National Park!<BR>
<BR>
On April 8 in Karura Forest, the highlight was a resident pair of White-backed Ducks with two half-grown ducklings.<BR>
<BR>
And on April 9 in Nairobi National Park with the family, over 40 vultures &#8211; mostly White-backed, some R&uuml;ppell&#8217;s &#8211; descending to a lion kill.<BR>
<BR>
Wishing you good birding, Fleur<BR>
