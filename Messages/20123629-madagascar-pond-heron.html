This is an unprecidented number for us in a single location so PERHAPS they had only recently arrived. We will check out other rice schemes in the valley next weekend as well as
 revisting this one to see if the birds are still around.</span></div><div><span></span>&nbsp;</div><div><span>This msg serves to alert everyone that these birds are now arriving so please find time to visit known sites and let us have any information including negative data and a comment on the quality of the habitat</span></div><div><span></span>&nbsp;</div><div><span>many thanks</span></div><div><span></span>&nbsp;</div><div><span>Neil</span></div><div></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Neil and Liz Baker, Tanzania Bird Atlas, P.O.
