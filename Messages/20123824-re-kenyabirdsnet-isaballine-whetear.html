  <pre>Hi James,
This looks like an Isabelline to me. The bill appears long and
slender, not very dark around the eyes and as you say very upright.
When the young and adult birds are first arriving with the first
arriving Northerns, they really do look similar. It only seems to be
after they have been here a while that Isabellines look so much
cleaner, and northerns have such obvious dark flight feathers.
Best for now
Brian

&gt; I got this bird on Sep 11.  Is it an Isaballine by its very upright posture
