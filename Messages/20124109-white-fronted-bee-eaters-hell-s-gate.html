  <hr/>
  Dear all,<br />a few years ago there were worries about the possible decline in White-fronted Bee-eaters so any observation might be worth reporting. On 7 April we saw a group of about 150 hawking for what I suppose where ants or termites after a good shower (even the Bat-eared Foxes were out hunting in broad daylight) above the cliffs at the camp site in Hells Gate National Park in the afternoon. I briefly heard them again on the morning of the 8th but could not see them (rather a misty morning up there). <br />
