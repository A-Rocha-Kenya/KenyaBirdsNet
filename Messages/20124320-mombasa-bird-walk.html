<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Bird walk to Central Quarry Sat. 15th 
Dec.&nbsp;&nbsp; Water quite high.&nbsp; Lots of Little Egrets, (one beautiful 
dark phase),&nbsp;Cattle Egrets coming in large numbers for roosting.&nbsp; Lots 
of Reed Cormorants. Small flock of Common Greenshank (used to be huge flock here 
every season&nbsp;but they seem to have severely diminished), Black Heron doing 
its umbrella thing.&nbsp; Purple and Striated (how I hate that description) 
Heron and a Little Bittern which just flew from one patch of reeds to 
another.&nbsp; Eurasian Bee-Eaters which hardly seem to settle around Mombasa, 
always hear and see them flying over my garden, Malachite and Pied Kingfishers 
and a incredibly a Giant Kingfisher, a first for our bird walk and usually seen 
at Haller Park fish ponds where it is very elusive.&nbsp; Two Juvenile African 
Darters which I presume were the progeny of the nests we saw a month or two 
ago.&nbsp;&nbsp; A lovely Palm Nut Vulture flying around to crown the 
scene.&nbsp; 36 species seen in 2 hours.&nbsp; Especially gratifying in that we 
had some of our old birders back from Europe.</FONT></DIV>
