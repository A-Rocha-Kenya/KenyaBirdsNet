  <pre>Greetings

A cloudy morning with drizzle in Nairobi National Park with Mike Davidson,
Jennifer Oduori and Karen Plumbe turned up a variety of cuckoos and
challenging migratory warblers.

Cuckoos included Jacobin Cuckoo (black morph), Levaillant&#39;s Cuckoo, Great
Spotted Cuckoo, Common Cuckoo, Diederik Cuckoo and of course White-browed
Coucal feasting on termites.

Warblers included Great Reed, Sedge and Willow Warblers and probable Basra
Reed and Eurasian Reed Warblers. Good views also of resident Little Rush and
Lesser Swamp Warblers and cisticolas.

A few Wood Sandpipers, Red-backed and Lesser Grey Shrikes and flocks of
twittering Barn Swallows were still in the park. But we were so busy
watching the migrants fly-catching that we did not see any Ostrich!

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
