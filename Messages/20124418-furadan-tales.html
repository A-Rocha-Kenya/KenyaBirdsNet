Hi all,

During 2009 – 2010, I carried out a research &amp; conservation study at Bunyala Rice Irrigation Scheme; Measuring the conservation threat to birds in Kenya from deliberate pesticide poisoning published in the book  &lt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781119998532.ch3/summary&gt; A Chronicling of Long-Standing Carbofuran Use and its Menace to Wildlife in Kenya by Ngaio Richards (Editor) &lt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781119998532.ch3/summary&gt; . This may offer insights to the case of deliberate pesticide poisoning of birds.

 

Ralph’s proposition to harness income from live birds rather than poisoning then selling them (&amp; I have designed such a strategy but funds have not been forthcoming) is a workable solution ONLY that it needs some EXTRA time, FUNDING and INTENSIVE EDUCATION. In essence we actually should target beyond Carbofuran since other poisons either known differently or masqueraded as Furadan are also in use. 3 different samples of poisons were for instance collected from Bunyala during last year all labelled as Furadan but 2 were clearly not Furadan.

 

Ideally, in ‘forging’ birding guides should be handled parallel with research on issues (for instance for the case of the Carbofuran, Furadan) like what are the effects of Carbofuran to the human consumers? Studies to illustrate how the exposed human population is/has been affected by exposure to the poison must be integrated. This is particularly relevant to the semi-illiterate locals who only ‘believe after seeing’. The semi-illiterate &amp; illiterate persons are the likely characteristic human population that will be consistent at sites where there is pesticide poaching of birds for human consumption. Changing the locals’ attitudes therefore requires this tactful ‘illustrative approach’ bearing in mind that you will most likely be struggling to reverse a deeply rooted culture. Further, complimentary measures to support the initiated birding guides (ideally liberated poachers and local enthusiasts) must be integrated. These include ventures such as organizing and funding maiden birding trips to the sites by conservation organizations &amp; members such as BirdLife partners (&amp; in solidarity, probably not necessarily just organizations that deal with bird conservation but other taxa) to actually pay the novice guides and demonstrate economic profitability of guiding. In a way such trips would act as follow ups and may detect need for altered approach or verifying the success of the project.
