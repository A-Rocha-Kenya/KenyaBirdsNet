  <pre>Dear Birders,

I spent last two weeks on a research Project on Montane and Taita White-eyes in Nagangao Forest, Taita Hills, Mount Kasigau in taita Chyulu Hills, and the Kikuyu escarpment in Kireita Forest. 

We had a lot of Red-caped Robin Chats both observed in the Field and captured in the mist nets on Mount Kasigau. We captured a total of eight Red-caped R. Chats of which 4( 50%) were immature and 2 adult Recaptures. Other birds captured were the White-stared Robins both immature and adult, Cabani&#39;s Greenbuls, Taita White-eyes( so many), Green-backed Twinspot, crowned Eagle and olive sunbirds among others. Does the Stripe-cheeked Greenbul exist on Mount Kasigau? 

In Nagangoa Forest( the easiest fragment to access by birders) I observed a pair of Taita Apalis( With bothmtal and Colour rings-Metal/blue and Red/red), Srped Cheeked Greenbuls, Cabani&#39;s Greenbul, Taita white-eye, Hartloub&#39;s Turacco and Taita Thrush.

I Chylu Hills we captured Black caps, Tree pipits, White-cheeked bulbuls, Dark-caped Yellow warbler, Bronze Sunbirds, Ruppel&#39;s robin chats, Eastern Double Colored Sunbirds,Montane white-eyes, brown woodland warbler, Wilow warblers, Gre-backed Camaroptera, african Fire-finch,Spot-flanked Barbet, White-eared Barbet( only seen), white-stared Robin, Olive sunbird, Harloub&#39;s Turaco, Tropical Boubou, among Others.

On the Kikuyu Escarpment, great birding about one and half hours drive from Nairobi, very bad road from Kimende but accessible.We capture White-tared Robin, Ruppel&#39;s Robin chat, Evergreen Forest Warbler, White-browed Crombec, Abyssinian Hill Barbler, Yellow-whiskered greenbul, Mountain Greenbul, Cabanis&#39; greenbuls, Olive sunbird, Black-collared Apalis, Yellow-belied Waxbil and many others observed. Some of the Recaptured Yellow-whiskered greenbuls and Ruppel&#39;s Robin Chats could at least ten years old, will confirm soon.

Wish you a great birding Easter holoday.
