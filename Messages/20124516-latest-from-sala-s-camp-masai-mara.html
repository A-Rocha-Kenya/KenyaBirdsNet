  <div>Dear All,</div><div> </div><div>The first bird of the day yesterday was a Green-capped Eremomela feeding in the tree outside our tent, a bird I was not expecting here. That comes off the back of a Double-toothed Barbet the day before (14th).</div>
<div> </div><div>On last night&#39;s nightjar vigil, I saw a single female Pennant-winged (bringing my total to 8 birds since 8th July) and another unidentified species that shot through fast and low, possibly a Plain or Square-tailed.</div>
<div> </div><div>Best for now, </div><div>Adam</div>
