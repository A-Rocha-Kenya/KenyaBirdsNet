<b>The Kenyan government is pushing to build a road through Nairobi National Park</b> -- putting the future of this unique wildlife sanctuary at risk. But <b>the Kenya Wildlife Service head can stop this disaster. Sign the petition now</b> to give him to public mandate he needs to do so:

<b>The Kenyan government has just approved the construction of a road right through the unique Nairobi National Park.</b> But massive public opposition can give the head of the Kenya Wildlife Service the backing he needs to stop this outrageous decision. <wbr>
<wbr>

Nairobi National Park is an international gem -- home to over 100 species of mammals and a sanctuary for the endangered black rhino. But the government is trying to tarmac over part of this precious land to build a bypass round Nairobi. Kenyan biologist Paula Kahumbu is taking the government to court, but despite the pressure, they are still pushing the Kenya Wildlife Service to back this park-killing plan. <wbr>
<wbr>

<b>If we now add a wave of public opposition, we can strengthen the hand of KWS head Julius Kipng'etich and persuade him to stand up and stop this travesty. Sign the petition now</b> to call on KWS Director Kipng'etich to reject this route and save Nairobi National Park! When we reach 10,000 signatures, weâ€™ll deliver the petition directly to Kipng'etich and the Kenyan government:<wbr>

The national park is under enormous stress from a growing city, and <b>conservationists fear that this road project would set a precedent for further attempts to expand into the park</b>, as the land would be worth millions if built on. The government says the park can just get replacement land, but none has yet been secured and a major road would disrupt the park's precious habitat. Alternative road routes that avoid the national park have been dismissed without serious investigation.<wbr>
<wbr>

Just last year, <b>public opposition was key to defeating a plan to build a road through the heart of the Serengeti</b> National Park in Tanzania. The Kenyan government was strongly opposed to that project on environmental and tourism grounds -- but are now applying a double standard.<wbr>
<wbr>

But <b>public opposition can stop this road too.</b> The government is already under legal pressure, and a public outcry can force them to reconsider. <b>Sign the petition now to save the park:</b><wbr><wbr>

The Avaaz community is winning on issues just like this all around the world. Just last year, Avaaz joined with Indigenous people in Bolivia to stop a highway that would have sliced through the heart of the Amazon rainforest -- and won. Together, we are changing how politics works around the world, and now we can do so again.<wbr>
<wbr>


With hope,<wbr><wbr>
