  <pre>Dear Willy,
I think what you are hearing at Shompole is Common Buttonquail, which
is a carrying &#34;ooooom oooooom ooooooom&#34; repeated monotonously by the
female both day and night. They are calling around Ol Tepesi at
present. Did you see the fantastic (Southern) Black Bishops at
Shompole, they are common in the grasslands, and particularly around
the lodge, where they come and drink from the swimming pools.
Do you know what is happening to Shompole at present, I heard that it
was close, which is a great pity,
Very best for now
Brian

&gt; Dear Birders -
&gt;
&gt; I have never yet seen this bird, but have heard it twice- a repetitive sound
&gt; like a distant whooping hyena.
&gt;
&gt; First hearing was at Silole Sanctuary about a year ago, but this last
&gt; weekend, I heard it again in the grasslands surrounding the Ewaso Nyiro
&gt; river in Kajiado, on Shompole Group ranch...
&gt;
&gt; We also saw Spurwing geese in the swamp, Verreaux&#39;s Eagle Owls in the
&gt; riparian forest of Acacia tortilis &amp; plenty of flamingoes, avocets &amp; Black
&gt; winged stilts at Lake Magadi, where the causeway is impassable owing to the
&gt; excellent rains this year.
&gt;
&gt; Best, Will Knocker
