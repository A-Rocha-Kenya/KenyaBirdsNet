<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dear All</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Went on "hunt the Wryneck" yesterday afternoon with 
Kevin and Doris.&nbsp; So lucky, there it was still in the same patch of burned 
grassland running round with the Senegal Plovers that have a nest with 3 eggs in 
it.&nbsp; To say that it is not easy to see is the understatement of the year 
and it is only thanks to Kevin's very keen eyesight that we found it.&nbsp; Once 
located it behaved superbly, standing upright, running around feeding, flying 
into a charred doum palm and posing for about 20 minutes while Doris took a 
whole series of good pictures </FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>which no doubt she 
will be posting on Facebook.&nbsp; A long time since I had a 
'lifer'.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>While we had gone to find the Wryneck we also saw 
about 30 other species, including several lesser Grey Shrikes, one Red Backed 
Shrike.&nbsp; Eurasian Cuckoos had been around but they seem to have gone now. 
Brown Chested Snake Eagle, Black Shouldered Kite, Red Faced Crombec, Black 
Headed Batis, Sulphur Breasted Bush Shrike, Scaly Babblers, white phase Paradise 
Flycatcher, several Bare Eyed Thrushes, White Browed Scrub Robin and a fabulous 
Gabon (Square Tailed) Nightjar plus a large group of Woolly Necked Storks.

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>While Nguuni may have become degraded due to the 
large number of Giraffe and Water Buck it can still yield quite a lot of bird 
species.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
