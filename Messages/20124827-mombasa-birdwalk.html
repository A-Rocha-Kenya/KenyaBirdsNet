<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dear Birders,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Mombasa birdwalk at Nguu Tatu on Huseini diary land 
was a veritable wonderfland of birds in direct contrast to the last two that 
while enjoyable, were somewhat quiet.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The grassland round the pond was alive with Superb 
and Greater Blue Earred Starlings, Northern Carmine Bee-eaters, Golden Pipits (a 
rare visitor), Zanzibar Red Bishops, Diedrik Cuckoos, Golden Palm, 
female&nbsp;Village and Grosbeak&nbsp;Weavers, Black Kites (no crows around), 
Woolly Necked Storks, Yellow Fronted Canary, and for a first on our Mombasa 
Birdwalk, White Crested Helmet Shrikes (usually see around Sagala).&nbsp; Other 
specials for the day Red Faced Crombec, Black Headed Batis, Nubian Woodpecker, 
Scarlet Chested Sunbird, Laughing Dove (which seems to have moved into this area 
in small numbers, Black Cukcoo Shirke (female), African Paradise Flycatcher 
(brown phase, we usually see white) and a single Eurasian Golden Oriole (our 
first this season) plus many other more common species.&nbsp; 42 species in 
about 2 hours birding.&nbsp; I just had to share it.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Wishing you all busy birding</FONT></DIV>
