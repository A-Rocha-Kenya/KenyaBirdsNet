  <hr/>
  <pre>last week Sunday on the bus to Garsen i looked over the window at salt pans and saw a great number of Flamingos between gongoni and marereni busy feeding, this has shown a rise of number from the previous time when i passed there.
Last time i mention about a pair of southern banded snake eagle at Wema irrigation scheme bordering forest at Village in Tana delta, when i went to books of record i found at Kenya IBA book that the birds were last seen in 1996. is it true or did somebody saw them between that time and now?
