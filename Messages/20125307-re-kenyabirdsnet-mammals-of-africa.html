  <pre>Tom and all

I got their very comprehensive catalogue at the bird fair . The overall
cost of the 6 volumes is pds 550 until 13/5 2003 , then they will be pds
600.

I am sure all details can be had at their website 
www.bloomsbury.com/naturalhistory

 Hi Kapanya,
&gt;
&gt; All volumes of Mammals of Africa are expected  to be published at the same
&gt; time....and ready for distribution by end of  February 2013.  How payment
&gt; might be made to Bloomsbury Publishers is  something that I do not yet
&gt; know,
&gt; but I imagine that payment via credit  card, check or wire transfers will
&gt; all
&gt; be possible...with credit card probably  being the most expedient for most
&gt; of us.
&gt;
&gt; I am copying this to Nigel Redman, Head of Natural History,  Bloomsbury
&gt; Publishers, so that he can keep the Kenya and Tanzania Birds Groups
&gt; informed
&gt; concerning the publication of MOA...and how best to make payment.   If we
&gt; do
&gt; not hear from Nigel for a few weeks, it is because he is leaving London
&gt; about now for a bird tour in Djibouti and Somaliland (lucky him).   Nigel
&gt; has
&gt; lead many bird tours to East Africa. As such, I am sure that he will  be
&gt; pleased to keep the Kenya and Tanzania Birds Groups informed as concerns
&gt; MOA.
&gt;
&gt; Best wishes,
&gt;
&gt; Tom

&gt; Hi Tom,
&gt; Thannk you for both very exciting news about Eurasian Bee Eaters  and
&gt; Mammal of Africa Book!
&gt; I hope that the Eurasian Bee Eaters will be allover in Tanzania end  of
&gt; this Sept and early Oct. From my observation around Arusha and Usa  River,
&gt; I
&gt; found that their arrival is normally to coincide with Jacaranda  trees??!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; About the Book, is it all 6 volumes ready; how one can pay and when  to do
&gt; so?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thank you.

&gt; About 10  days ago I saw the first European Bee-eaters pass through
&gt; Thumamah (near Riyadh, Saudi Arabia) but, perhaps, I did not see  the
&gt; first of
&gt; them.
&gt;
&gt; On another subject, Mammals of Africa is  expected to be published in
&gt; February.
