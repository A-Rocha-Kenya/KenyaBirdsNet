Hi everyone

We are pleased to announce the launch of a brand new project at
www.g-bird.org which should hopefully shed new light on Africa&#39;s bird
movements, distributions and abundances across the continent and associated
islands. The project is aimed at all bird-watchers and allows a new level of
3-D feedback and display. The system includes all 2,500+ species from the
region and displays all your sightings recorded per trip in 3-D, flagging
any Out-of-range sighting in Red to immediately alert a potential mis-id.
g-Bird also displays recognised Distribution maps for each species as well
as Grid analysed Reporting Rate Percentages per species where data has been
collected.


The aim of the project is to
a) provide a single consistent protocol that will be workable throughout
Africa. This allows grid-analysed results to be displayed seamlessly across
the continent for any resolution (such as Quarter Degree Square, 5min x
5min, 5km x 5km etc)(or alternatively against Vegetation, Rainfall or Relief
datasets).

b) collect data at GPS accuracy with exact Time which will allow any type of
analysis for specific project requirements from different organisations

c) integrate smart-phone technology to record in-the-field data

d) provide a built-in level of data vetting on the phone which immediately
flags the birder to a possible mis-id. And most importantly to do this while
the birder is still in the field and has the chance to re-assess the id of
the the bird while it is still present

e) provide a new level of 3-D feedback of different types for participants

f) create personalised lists &amp; export sightings to CSV or Excel format for
use elsewhere



Adding your sightings to view in 3-D is done through the g-Bird Mobile
smartphone app which is available for free download from the iStore (if you
have an iPhone). Other platforms such as Android, Windows and Blackberry
will be available in the near future. Alternatively if you already have GPS
captured sightings (for example from Cybertracker software) and would like
to see them in 3-D, you can email them through to us and we will add them in
from our side.


The smartphone apps allow quick and easy recording of ones sightings,
displaying them on GoogleMaps on the phone and flagging any sighting that
falls outside of its recognised distribution range to allow one the chance
to re-assess its id. It also keeps current Trip list totals and totals per
species.


Registering on www.g-Bird.org  is free or one can also open the system as a
Test user by pressing the &#34;Log in as Test User&#34; link which will allow you to
use the system with test data. There is a once-off installation of the
GoogleEarth Browser plugin if you have not already previously installed it.
Species names are available in 9 languages and follow the IOC (v 2.10)
naming convention by default, though this can be reset to follow the
Clements or Sibley-Monroe lists if needed


Screenshots of the system are available at www.g-bird.org/screenshots
More information on the Data Analysis protocol can be viewed at
www.g-bird.org/protocol

We hope this proves to be a valuable tool for all birders
