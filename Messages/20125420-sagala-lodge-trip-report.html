  Hello,<br><br>We spent a day at the wonderful Sagala Lodge
 (just past Voi heading south to Mombasa from Nairobi, part of the Tsavo
 ecosystem) this weekend past, and saw some amazing birds. The bushland 
is very dry right now so the water holes are a magnet for birds and 
mammals. Eastern Paradise Whydahs were out in force, we saw up to 80 
males at one time clustered in the trees near the water hole with a few 
straw-tails and a single steel-blue thrown in for good measure. 
Thousands of Red-billed Quelea and Chestnut Weavers filled the bushes 
and trees surrounding the pond, jostling for space and making one hell 
of a racket. Once every 30-60 minutes the massed flock would get up the 
courage to rush to the waters edge in a mad tangle of beaks and feathers
 to take a few nervous gulps of liquid before fleeing back to cover.Â  
Amongst the throngs of common birds Cut-throat Finches, Blue-capped 
Cordonblues, Grey-Headed Silverbill, Yellow-spotted Petronia, 
Black-faced sandgrouse, Little and Madagascar Bee-eaters and numerous 
dove and swallow species took their chances too. All the commotion did 
not go unnoticed by predators, a Lanner Falcon swooped by on several 
occasions causing panic and Eastern-Pale Chanting Goshawk mopped up any 
birds struggling or drowned in the water.<br>
<br>A short night drive to the waterhole revealed 10 elephant and 
white-tailed mongoose, but the real highlight was the beautiful stars 
and milkyway of the unpolluted moonless sky.<br><br>The Spotted-Eagle 
Owl is still in residence in the Euphorbia tirucalli trees adjacent to 
the car park and pearl-spotted owlets were also quite easy to come by.<br>
