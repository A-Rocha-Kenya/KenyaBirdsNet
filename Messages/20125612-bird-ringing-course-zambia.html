  <pre>Hi all

The Zambian Ornithological Society invited me to run a bird ringing
course on Bovu Island, on the Zambezi River, about 60 km upstream of
Victoria Falls. There were about 10 attendees, and one (Rory McDougal)
has qualifed as a SAFRING ringer. A total of 327 birds of 45 different
species were ringed.

The most ringed species was Red-billed Quelea (mostly juveniles) that
were feeding on sorghum crops. Some migrants were ringed, probably en
route north: Pygmy Kingfisher, Red-backed Shrike, European Marsh
Warbler, and European Reed Warbler.

To see a trip report with photos, full species list of ringed birds
and acknowledgements, see http://weavers.adu.org.za/trip2012zm.php
