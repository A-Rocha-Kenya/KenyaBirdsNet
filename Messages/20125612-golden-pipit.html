  <pre> Hello birders

I was so exited to see the golden pipit at samburu between 06 and 09 of this Month.It was my first time and the first flush of yellow that to me looked like a bat then another flush and better confirmed to be the bird.Then that complete yellow and black throat made me click to yellow throated longclaw but it was slightly smaller and more and zero brown of longclaw.Thank to the guide book now a tick on my list.

All the best birders.

George.
