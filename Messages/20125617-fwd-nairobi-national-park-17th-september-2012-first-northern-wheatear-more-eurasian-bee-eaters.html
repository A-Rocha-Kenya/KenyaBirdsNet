It was an overcast and gloomy cool</span><br><span>day, but brightened up late morning and became sunny. We were only</span><br><span>there for the morning, leaving at 1.30pm.</span><br><span>There was little happening in the gloom at KWS Mess gardens, or Ivory</span><br><span>Burning Site. The latter had three Violet-backed Starlings. Also</span><br><span>nothing much on the back road to Hyena Dam apart from a Green</span><br><span>Sandpiper, and at the dam several African Water Rails were calling,</span><br><span>and there were four Wood Sandpipers. Seven Hippos were clustered in</span><br><span>the water. On the run-off was a confiding Northern Wheatear, our first</span><br><span>for the season, and in spite of the early date, the bird appeared to</span><br><span>be an immature. &nbsp;There were also six Orange-breasted Waxbills here. At</span><br><span>Karen PC Dam was a Madagascar Pond Heron. NNP which has always been a</span><br><span>good location for the species, had so far this year failed to produce</span><br><span>a single bird. Whether this was due to there being so much habitat for</span><br><span>the species outside of the Park, or whether it is due to the alarming</span><br><span>decrease in the world population cannot be determined. &nbsp;Along the</span><br><span>Mokoyeti there was a pair of adult Martial Eagles at their nest,</span><br><span>though no sign of the young birds. Also near the Beacon there were six</span><br><span>Somali Short-toed Larks flying around, and above Athi Basin there was</span><br><span>a single Green Sandpiper, a pair of Crowned Cranes with two well grown</span><br><span>young, a pair of Secretarybirds at a nest, some forty loafing vultures</span><br><span>which included single Ruppell’s and Lappet-faced, a couple of</span><br><span>Shelley’s Francolin, and a couple of Rosy-breasted Longclaws. There</span><br><span>was also a group of fourteen Eurasian Bee-eaters that could not fly</span><br><span>south fast enough and carried on into the distance. Athi Dam produced</span><br><span>an immature Fish Eagle, two Black-crowned Night=Herons, three</span><br><span>Spur-winged Plover, and about thirty-five Kittlitz’s Plover, migrants</span><br><span>were seven Little Stints, a Common Greenshank and two Common</span><br><span>Sandpipers. There were small numbers of Barn Swallows moving</span><br><span>southwards. Common Quailfinch, that had been seen all through the</span><br><span>grassland in small parties, had now become abundant and were drinking</span><br><span>and perching openly. There were some thousand birds, along the edge of</span><br><span>Athi Dam we could see up to a hundred birds together drinking, whilst</span><br><span>even more were visible in the air at one time as we drove alongside</span><br><span>the grass. They have come in in unprecedented numbers, and we even had</span><br><span>an albino example!</span><br><span></span><br><span>Mammals were coming back into the Park, Zebra and Eland were in</span><br><span>numbers, less usual were a pair of Orbi near Hyena run-off and two</span><br><span>male Lions on top of the Athi Basin.</span><br><span></span><br><span>A very pleasant morning, nothing too ourageous but plenty to see.</span><br><span></span><br><span>Best to all</span><br><span></span><br><span>Brian</span><br></div></blockquote></body></html>
