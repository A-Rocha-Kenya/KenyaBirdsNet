Dear All,

You will recall that in November 2011, I reported on the pair of Grey  
Parrots seen frequently in the Spring Valley Road area.

Well, the pair has either had a happy event or found a friend, because  
there are now 3 birds!!  They all look about the same size, so  
difficult to say if the original 2 have become parents or not.

They have been absent for several months, but returned this week, and  
were seen last week, at a distance, and I was sure there were 3  
birds.  Today I have had two good sightings of all 3 feeding in top of  
our Erythrina tree that is currently flowering.

Birders in the Spring Valley area might be lucky enough to add them to  
their list of birds seen during the World Bird Watch on 6/7 October!

Best wishes,

Philip.
