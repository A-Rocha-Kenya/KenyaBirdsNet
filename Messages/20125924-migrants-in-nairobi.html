  <pre>Greetings birders

An Eastern Olivaceous Warbler has been singing its scratchy song in my
Nairobi garden since 18 January.

At Uhuru Gardens National Monument on Nature Kenya&#39;s Wednesday Morning
Birdwalk March 21, there were Barn Swallows, Eastern Olivaceous Warblers,
Willow Warblers, Spotted Flycatchers, Nightingale and Common Rock Thrush. On
the 23rd there was a Common Whitethroat and a local wanderer, a stunning
Beautiful Sunbird.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
