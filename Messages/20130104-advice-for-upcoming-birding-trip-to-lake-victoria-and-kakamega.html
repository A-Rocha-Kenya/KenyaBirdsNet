  <pre>Hello,

a group of us are planning a trip to Lake Victoria and Kakamega and are fishing for advice for birding sites and accomdation?

Our rough plan at the moment is:

1) Homa Bay &amp; Rusinga Island (2 days)

We&#39;re planning on staying at Homa Tourist Hotel as the Rusinga Lodge is too expensive, does anyone have any other good alternatives in the area?

We&#39;re not sure where the best birding spots here are, we are planning to go to Bird Island but other than that any suggestions would be welcome.
 
2) Ruma National Park (1 day)

Again we haven&#39;t been here before so any tips on specialties and sites would be welcome.

3) Kisumu (1 day)

The IBA map shows 3 swamps: Dunga, Koguta and Kusa. We only have time to do one swamp on our way to Kakamega so which of these is best for birding?

4) Kakamega (3 days)

Has anyone stayed in Isikuti Guesthouse or Udo&#39;s Bandas? if so what did you think? We are looking for some cheaper alternatives (preferably with food) to Rondo Retreat for part of our group. 

Is the site for the Rock Pratincoles on the Nzoia River at the bridge over the river just before Mumias on the Busia-Mumias Road (C33)? Has anyone seen them recently?
