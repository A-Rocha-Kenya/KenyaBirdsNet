  <div dir="ltr">Homa Bay Tourist hotel is fine but better to pay a little bit extra for the tents (with hot shower and flushing loo) as the rooms are small and pokey.<div style>Before heading off to more exciting birding areas (which I haven&#39;t been able to visit so far because always been passing through on work) check out the pier which is a short walk from the hotel - gonolek, sunbirds and weavers in abundance plus coucal.  Also a wander into the fields in front of the hotel (accessed from the pier road) usually yields a few things.</div>
<div style><br></div><div style>In Kakamega a cheap but safe hotel with parking and a neat little bar and restaurant is SIAYA GUESTHOUSE on the right heading up towards Nakumatt.  (0733614010).  </div><div style><br></div>
<div style>Hope this helps. Sounds a fab trip.  </div><div style>Enjoy the birding!</div><div style>Sheena</div></div><div class="gmail_extra"><br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On 4 January 2013 13:15, <a href="mailto:stewardpeter@ymail.com">stewardpeter@ymail.com</a> <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:peetmate@gmail.com" target="_blank">peetmate@gmail.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>

      <p>Hello,<br>
<br>
a group of us are planning a trip to Lake Victoria and Kakamega and are fishing for advice for birding sites and accomdation?<br>
<br>
Our rough plan at the moment is:<br>
<br>
1) Homa Bay &amp; Rusinga Island (2 days)<br>
<br>
We&#39;re planning on staying at Homa Tourist Hotel as the Rusinga Lodge is too expensive, does anyone have any other good alternatives in the area?<br>
<br>
We&#39;re not sure where the best birding spots here are, we are planning to go to Bird Island but other than that any suggestions would be welcome.<br>
 <br>
2) Ruma National Park (1 day)<br>
<br>
Again we haven&#39;t been here before so any tips on specialties and sites would be welcome.<br>
<br>
3) Kisumu (1 day)<br>
<br>
The IBA map shows 3 swamps: Dunga, Koguta and Kusa. We only have time to do one swamp on our way to Kakamega so which of these is best for birding?<br>
<br>
4) Kakamega (3 days)<br>
<br>
Has anyone stayed in Isikuti Guesthouse or Udo&#39;s Bandas? if so what did you think? We are looking for some cheaper alternatives (preferably with food) to Rondo Retreat for part of our group. <br>
<br>
Is the site for the Rock Pratincoles on the Nzoia River at the bridge over the river just before Mumias on the Busia-Mumias Road (C33)? Has anyone seen them recently?<br>
<br>
