  <pre>Neil,

Besides Text Book Centre, also with another branch in Kijabe St.,
check also at Book Point which is in Moi Ave. opposite Ibrahims &amp;
almost at the junction with Kenyatta Ave. A bookshop housed in bldg
where New Stanley Hotel is (along Kenyatta Ave. side) might be worth
checking.

Good luck.

Wamiti.

&gt; NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 7th January 2013
&gt;
&gt; Dear All,
&gt; On 7th January after some rearranging, Mike Davidson, Jennifer Oduore,
&gt; Karen Plumbe and myself were kindly transported around the Park by Mrs
&gt; Watt, who was relatively new to birding but highly hooked and had over
&gt; sixty new species bringing her to over three hundred for her Kenyan
&gt; list.
&gt; We were through the Main Gate a little before 7.00am, there had been
&gt; some recent light rain with heavier falls three days before but none
&gt; of the roads had become impassable although the inside road to Karen
&gt; PS Dam had become sticky.
&gt; We commenced at the KWS Mess Garden, where there were a few birds
&gt; showing activity in the sunlight. Amongst these were a Nightingale
&gt; sitting on a post next to the rubbish tip, a Spotted Flycatcher on the
&gt; fence, a couple of Garden Warblers, six or so Blackcaps, and the
&gt; Black-collared Apalis in the hedge still present.
&gt; From here we went to Ivory Burning Site where another Nightingale
&gt; called from cover, but there was nothing else to reward us. A detour
&gt; to Nagalomon Dam did reward us however, with a Swamphen coaxed from
&gt; cover and a Great Reed Warbler in song in the typha. Along the back of
&gt; Hyena Dam, African Water Rails rushed out to wish us a happy 2013, a
&gt; couple of Wahlberg’s Honeybirds were chasing each other around the
&gt; bushes and a male Syke’s Yellow Wagtail fed on the mud, finally a
&gt; couple of Village Indigobirds were on the fence (not usually seen in
&gt; the north of the Park for some unknown reason). At Hyena Dam there
&gt; were twenty Wood and a few Green Sandpipers, and a few Yellow-crowned
&gt; Bishops flew over. One of our few Barn Swallows for the day was here.
&gt; On the Hyena Dam run-off there was a female Saddle-billed Stork, a
&gt; few Rosy-breasted Longclaws in colour, the first of five Whinchat,
&gt; first of three Isabelline Shrikes, all three widowbirds in breeding
&gt; dress and five Yellow-crowned Bishops also with males in nuptial
&gt; plumage. Eland Hollow failed to produce, and Karen PC Dam gave up a
&gt; handsome adult Black Stork and ten more Yellow-crowned Bishops. Near
&gt; the Beacon was a male Kori Bustard, another dozen Yellow-crowned
&gt; Bishops and our only three Quailfinch of the day.
&gt; Athi Basin could only come up with two Northern and one Isabelline
&gt; Wheatears, a Long-billed Pipit, and a couple of Pangani Longclaws,
&gt; whilst Athi Dam attracted a few birds such as four each Pink-backed
&gt; Pelicans and White Stork, only two Yellow-billed Storks, a Little
&gt; Egret (always inexplicably rare in NNP), just one Black-winged Stilt,
&gt; but some thirty Kittlitz’s and a dozen Spur-winged Plovers. Just three
&gt; Little Stints and four Greenshank were all the representatives of
&gt; palearctic waders. Along the causeway there was a roosting adult
&gt; Black-crowned Night-Heron and a sub-adult Fish Eagle. At Cheetah Gate
&gt; there were a few species associated with drier ground like d’Arnaud’s
&gt; Barbet, Crimson-rumped and Black-faced Waxbills and several parties of
&gt; Speckle-fronted Weavers. Along Rhino Circuit was an interesting mixed
&gt; group of Ostrich chicks of every size imaginaeable, about twenty in
&gt; number with a pair of adults, single Lesser Spotted Eagle
&gt; (horrifyingly the only migrant raptor of the day), and a different
&gt; sub-adult Fish Eagle. In the bush were a glowing Pygmy Kingfisher and
&gt; another couple of Spotted Flycatchers
&gt; We returned via Kingfisher and round to Main Gate, but found nothing
&gt; else of interest, and were through the Main Gate just before 5.00pm.
&gt; Ornithologically no surprises, and still the feeling that the migrants
&gt; are not representing themselves well.
&gt;
&gt; Really large numbers of plains game in the southern parts and
&gt; Kingfisher, Zebra and Eland are coming back, and apart from a few
&gt; singles there was a group of twenty Wildebeest at Athi Dam. There were
&gt; seven White Rhinos near Kingfisher, but nothing really of note in the
&gt; mammal department.
&gt;
&gt; Best to all
&gt; Brian
