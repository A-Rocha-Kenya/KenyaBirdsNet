  <pre>Northern Chyulus and Tsavo East Christmas 2012

We spent four days in the northern end of the chyulu hills over Christmas before driving to the coast via a very wet tsavo east. In total we saw 162 species. Of interest we saw hundreds of European storks and hundreds of barn swallows with about 6 lesser kestrels on the plains near Mbirikani to the west of Ol doinyo Waus. There were large numbers of flappet larks displaying on the plains. We saw a single Eurasian hobby feeding on the wing above the plains. There were isabelline and pied wheatears present all over the grasslands with isabelline being significantly more numerous.

We camped in the hills and after a wet night we had a group of 18 Eurasian rollers fly over camp in the early morning. On a walk into the thicker bush on the hills around camp we saw a single willow warbler and a single olivaceous warbler with three or four spotted flycatchers, numerous black throated and spot flanked barbets and a group of northern brownbuls. We explored some caves in the area and spooked a pair of roosting barn owls in the entrance to one-they kept flying around giving us a fantastic close up siting of these magnificent birds. We saw a single red backed shrike.

Game was fairly sparse. There were quite a lot of signs of elephant along the west side of the hills although we only saw one large lone bull. Zebra and gazelle were present on the plains and we saw several small groups of eland and 10 oryx as well as a few scattered kongoni in the hills.  Giraffe were fairly numerous. There were lots of cattle on the fringes of the park although there were old bomas to suggest that they had been utilising the area around camp relatively recently. Alarmingly we found a snare on one of the big game trails between the hills and several large piles of skulls and bones (giraffe, Kongoni and zebra) hidden collectively in spots in the lava flows in such a way that they can only have been from poachers butchering the animals in a given spot. We reported this to the KWS post on the east side of the hills on our way out and they did not seem particularly surprised.

On the drive through Tsavo golden pipits were present in their hundreds in full breeding plumage the whole way through the park. We saw four or five Ethiopian swallows at Lugards falls. We saw both a male and female pallid harrier. There was lots of flood damage to the road and we had to negotiate several bonnet-deep luggas in full flow. In some of the roadside pools there were waders present and we saw common green shank, common sand piper, wood sandpiper, little stints and three banded plovers. We spotted a loan male lion on a hill near sala gate and there were large numbers of elephant in this area too despite the rain and greenery. We were surprised by the general lack of raptors. Around camp there were a few black-shouldered kites, a single tawny eagle, a single pygmy falcon, a single harrier hawk, and a single little sparrow hawk. We saw a pair of pale chanting goshawks and a single white backed vulture. Along the Galana we saw two roosting batleurs and a pair of fish eagles. Not enough in our minds...
