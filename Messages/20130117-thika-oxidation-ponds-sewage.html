  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" ><tr><td valign="top" style="font: inherit;">Hello Birders.<br><br>Last Saturday 12th decided to go Thika Sewage 
oxidation pond by Public van where by i had to connect&nbsp; through a number
 of matatus to the nearest area (Kiganjo stage) then from there i took a
 motorbike to the ponds.<br><br>When i arrived there at around 10.00 am i
 had to alert management in particular the security at the gate for i 
didn't go through the Sewage department at Thika town. His name was Mr. 
Njoroge Cell; 0723 930 391.<br><br>&nbsp;Started my walk at 10.15am where the cloud cover was about 40%, partly windy and sunny.<br><br>Finding:
 Northern Shoveler +20,Northern Pin
 tail +6 males for i could not be able to positively tell females them 
from those of Garganey,&nbsp; Garganey&nbsp; males +2 ,Southern Pochards +18, 
Kittlitz's Plover +3, Long toed Lapwing +2, Knob-billed Duck +1 and the 
birds which dominated in the area were the Red-billed Teal +150, little 
stint 500+, Black-winged slilt 60+, Ruff's 120+,Little grebe +50, 
Spur-winged Plover +47 plus other bird that i have not listed here.<br><br>Wondering
 about if&nbsp; there is any record from this area of Caspian plover , For 
what i saw&nbsp; had a supercilium stripe, brown breast band, but with a kind
 of pointed wings. To me, from the guide book it looked like 
non-breeding Caspian plover. Any help for this will be highly 
appreciated.<br><br>Wishing you all a happy and lucky birding.<br><br>George.<br></td></tr></table>
