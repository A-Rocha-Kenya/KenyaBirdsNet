  <pre>NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 14th January 2013

Dear All,
Mike Davidson, Fleur Ngâ€™Weno, Jeniffer Oduore, Karen Plumbe and myself
met at the Main Entrance of Nairobi National Park at 6:40am and were
soon through the gate. There had been some rain a few days before but
nothing much since and the roads were quite dry. It was a sunny
morning as we first visited the KWS Mess Garden. Here we found a few
each of Garden Warbler and Blackcap, a secretive Eurasian Reed Warbler
in the hedge, a Spotted Flycatcher and a couple of Nightingales. A
Tree Pipit flew over without stopping and the Black-collared Apalis
was singing from within the Army Barracks. On the drive down towards
the Ivory Burning Site a slaty falcon flew over high and unfortunately
into the sun, that could have been a late Amur as the wings were not
long.  Nothing much was happening at Ivory Burning Site, a Darter flew
off Nagalomon Dam, and a Spur-winged Goose flew over. At Nagalomon
Dam, there were no night-herons to be seen, but there was a Swamphen
feeding in the edge of the typha, and the Great Reed Warbler was
singing from the same place as the previous Monday, there was a
Nightingale also singing here. A remarkable sight was of fifteen
Crowned Cranes coming in to drink causing us to linger for some time.
