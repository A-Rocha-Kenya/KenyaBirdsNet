Hi All, <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
I just received a call from Brian Finch who is on tour with clients. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
He has just seen House Crows at the Sikh Temple in Makindu. This could be their penultimate bastion before reaching Nairobi so if anyone (especially the staff at the Museum) has the means to 'control' these birds, then please do now quickly. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
Cheers for now <BR>
Adam <BR>
