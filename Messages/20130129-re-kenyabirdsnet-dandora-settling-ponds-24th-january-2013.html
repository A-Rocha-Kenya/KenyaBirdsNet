  <pre>Hi Peter,
Thanks for the response, I have seen Peter Ushers picture of the
drake, but did not know of the duck. The last Kenya record I can
recall is ten years ago at Thika when at the same time there were with
the two female Tufteds, two drake Ferruginous and a duck Gadwall.
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Hi Brian,
&gt;
&gt; The Tufted Ducks were male and female which we observed in our group,
&gt; section 3 of
&gt; the Dandora Settling Ponds. I understand the last sighting was about 10
&gt; years ago,quite
&gt; amazing! Too bad we didnt manage to take any photo though Peter Usher has 1
&gt; or 2 of the
&gt; Ducks.
&gt;
&gt; Best regards,
&gt;
&gt; Peter Wairasho

&gt; DANDORA SETTLING PONDS 24th January 2013.
&gt;
&gt; As part of the waterbird count, Mike Davidson, Jennifer Oduore, Salma
&gt; Watt and myself patrolled one fifth of the enormous area. I am not
&gt; sure what the species recorded by  the other teams were, I do know
&gt; that after we left, a male Tufted Duck was found on another tank. On
&gt; our section we did have three Black-headed Gulls, a couple of
&gt; Whiskered, fifteen White-winged Black and a Gull-billed Tern, good
&gt; numbers of Wood Sandpipers and Ruff, but few other waders, nothing
&gt; more interesting than a Ringed Plover. There were 84 Garganey, but no
&gt; other palearctic ducks, a Western Marsh Harrier, some 100 Yellow
&gt; Wagtails  of which the most interesting was a male Black-headed Yellow
&gt; Wagtail (feldegg), the first I have ever seen around Nairobi.
&gt;
&gt; Best to all
&gt; Brian
