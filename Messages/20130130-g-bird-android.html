<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Hi everyone<BR>The&nbsp;Android version of g-Bird 
was recently released and is available for Free download from the Google 
PlayStore. <BR>The app is aimed at making it quick, easy and loads of fun to 
record what you are currently viewing in the field and provide a large amount of 
feedback </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>including maps, lists, reports, 
out-of-range vetting and trip-counters. Once uploaded, your sightings will then 
also be viewable in 3-D GoogleEarth on </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial><A 
href="http://www.g-bird.org">www.g-bird.org</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; and can be emailed 
to others who birded with you.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>The app can be used in any country in Africa and 
features full Country lists for each country in several different languages. 
Each sighting added from </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>your trip is shown to 
fall either inside or outside of&nbsp;its known distribution range for that 
species at the point where you recorded it. I have found this to be&nbsp;really 
</FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>useful when birding in an area outside of where I 
am familiar with and am not sure as to whether a particular species should occur 
there. The </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>immediate feedback gives one the 
chance to re-id the bird while it is still in front of you in the case of it 
being confused with a similar species.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>The iPhone version is also available for free 
download from the Apple iStore.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>We hope this proves useful to birders in the 
future</FONT></DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>
