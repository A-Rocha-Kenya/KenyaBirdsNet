  <pre> a brief stop by the road from Malindi to Garsen. The pools are well covered with blue lily. This time i didn&#39;t have my Bino, the i could see some Jacana, Egrets and at least my three favorite bird African pygmy goose. We ne to stop for a time and do a walk at this place where it is surrounded by bush.
Anybody passing this route please do list for the area as it is well conserved in way.
Good birding
