  <pre>Dear Birders,

Greetings to all. In the recent completed January/February water birds counts that ending with counts at Lake Magadi on 17th February, my team (Group 6) managed to spot and count one Terek Sandpiper.

The team was counting a section mid-way before getting to the hot springs walking towards the factory side.

Great birding to all.

Joshua
