  <pre>Dear All,
Thanks for the response I think you are right about altitude being a
probable factor between northern Serengeti and the Mara, but it
doesn&#39;t explain that we have not had it in the Lake Victoria basin
where contiguous vegetation and altitude is identical. On the Tz map,
we actually share three squares where they have been recorded in
Tanzania, admittedly along the border area it looks quite scarce. If a
Racket-tailed Roller can take the plunge, why hasn&#39;t a Ruaha
Hornbill!? Tony (Dawson) confirming receipt of your email as
requested. I don&#39;t suppose you have an image of the 1988 bird, I know
it was before cameras were invented, but...
It&#39;s not impossible that at Cottars, especially in drought conditions
that a Northern Red-bill could wander in, as much as a Ruaha wandering
up.
Best to all
Brian

&gt; Altitude is a factor with Grey-breasted Spurfowl (you have a population of
&gt; Red-necked that may help stop our bird) and Fischer&#39;s Lovebird (these birds
&gt; love Borassus Palms) and it USED to be with Rufous-tailed Weaver and we
&gt; thought with Karamoja Apalis (Acacia drepanolobium).
&gt;
&gt; so it&#39;s not simply altitude but there are vegetation changes with alt and
&gt; you need a geologist to look closely at the soils. There is also the
&gt; question of subtle changes in temperature to be considered and perhaps
&gt; changes in rainfall.
&gt;
&gt; Tony, hopefully you have insights into these ecological limits.

&gt; Hi Brian and all,
&gt;
&gt; This is a bird I was determined to find in the Mara and searched endlessly
&gt; for it, particularly while working close to the southern boundary, but to no
&gt; avail.
&gt;
&gt; Despite Britton apparently recording it in the Mara, I wonder if altitude
&gt; may be a prohibitive factor?
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Adam

&gt;&gt;Dear All,
&gt;&gt;Please look at the attached TZ Atlas map for Ruaha Hornbill. It must
&gt;&gt;be on our side of the border.
&gt;&gt;Has anyone seen a Red-billed Hornbill in the Mara (I certainly
&gt;&gt;haven’t), or along our border area near Lake Victoria, if so it must
&gt;&gt;be this species, still never recorded for Kenya.
&gt;&gt;Please check your records, and any images, you could have a first for
&gt;&gt;the country.
&gt;&gt;Best to all
&gt;&gt;Brian
