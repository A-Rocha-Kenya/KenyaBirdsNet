  <pre>Dear All,
Please look at the attached TZ Atlas map for Ruaha Hornbill. It must
be on our side of the border.
Has anyone seen a Red-billed Hornbill in the Mara (I certainly
havenâ€™t), or along our border area near Lake Victoria, if so it must
be this species, still never recorded for Kenya.
Please check your records, and any images, you could have a first for
the country.
Best to all
Brian
