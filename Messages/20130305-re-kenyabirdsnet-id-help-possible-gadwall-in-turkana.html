  <pre>Dear Martin,
Thanks for sharing the duck image with the net. Your bird is genus
Anas and palearctic.
We can illimiinate several species very quickly remembering that your
bird has an all dark bill and all very sharply contrasting white
underparts.
Mallard, never a black bill, and never white on belly.
Gadwall, in non-breeding always largely yellow bill with very dark
upper mandible. Male approaching breeding may have all dark bill but
then would not have any more white on underparts than centre of lower
belly.
Northern Pintail, mainly grey bill, never blackish, white of belly
restricted to centre.
Northern Shoveler, apart from bill shape shows much orange, never
blacksih bill, no white on belly in any plumage.
Eurasian Wigeon, in all plumages pale blue bill with dark tip, no face
pattern, white on centre of belly.
Common Teal, bill all plumages apart from adult male, dark but with
variable orange at base, adult male all dark grey, no white belly in
any plumages.
Garganey, all dark bill in all plumages, male shows extensive white on
belly as it approaches and is in breeding plumage.
I feel this is what you bird is.
The images show very sharp demarcation of brown upper-breast to head,
and entirely white from flanks to belly. Whilst it is still showing a
non-breeding head the white supercilium is starting to show. Garganey
is the only visiting dabbling duck with white flanks contrasting with
wings, and Tufted Duck is the only other visiting duck with white
flanks.
Hope this helps
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Hi Birders,
&gt; I saw this duck at Lake Turkana. My initial thoughts are that its a Gadwall
&gt; but I have never seen one so I&#39;m not 100%. My guess is based on the white
&gt; belly, small white wing patch (seen in photo 2). It was also a dabbling
&gt; duck.
&gt; I&#39;d appreciate any id help with this.
&gt; Best,
&gt; Martin
