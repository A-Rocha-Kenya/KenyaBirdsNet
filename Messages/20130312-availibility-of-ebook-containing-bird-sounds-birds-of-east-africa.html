  <pre>Dear All,
A progress report re the sound application. I have had further
conversations with My Digital World. The General Manager is friendly
with Safaricoms Group General Manager. They have arranged a special
line to be opened for a one-off transfer of the working copy of the
App. I have to go to Safaricom office in Nairobi tomorrow, leave my
Ipad, and collect it once the transfer is done. There is very high
security around Apps and I am impressed. Once I have it I can then go
through and troubleshoot and give it the quality control it has not
had. Once the product is in order, the amendments will be available as
a free update to all that have so far purchased the product. Please
bear with me.
All other contentious issues are moving ahead favourably, though no
word at all from Bloomsbury yet.
Best to all
Brian
