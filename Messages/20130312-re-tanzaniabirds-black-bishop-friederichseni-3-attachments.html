  <pre>Dear All,
Just as a PS, I have also seen it on the descent road down to Mtu
Wambu, and in Manyara itself near the new lodge in the SW corner.
Best
Brian

&gt; Dear All,
&gt; This is a great find and a major extension in known range. Only the
&gt; Black Bishops share the combination of black throat and forehead. The
&gt; bird is the friederichseni “form” of Black Bishop. I did not know it
&gt; extended to the Lake. I have seen it Seronera, Ndutu to Olduvai. What
&gt; happens north of there I have no idea, but it sneaks into Kenya in
&gt; north Natron and at the now defunct Shompole Lodge, the birds used to
&gt; come and drink from the swimming pool which was quite a sight. They
&gt; were seasonally common there. I have taken much video, which enables
&gt; me to send grabs of the bird in flight. In Kenya from the Lake
&gt; Victoria basin westwards we have ansorgei. This extends south to
&gt; Rusinga Island, but doesn’t appear to get further south and although
&gt; there is habitat it just seems to drop out.
&gt; For me the important thing is that I do not believe these two birds
&gt; are the same species, or even that closely related. A situation
&gt; similar to Usambara Drongo, where things just do not make sense
&gt; visually, for birds to be under the same specific umbrella.
&gt; Friederichseni whilst it has to feed in grasses like the entire genus,
&gt; displays from the tops of acacias and crotons etc. and is a bird of
&gt; scrubland. Gierowi only ever exists in some form of grass, be it
&gt; native or in gardens of Maize, Sorghum, Sugar Cane etc… but always in
&gt; a grass even though it may use adjacent bushes for perching and
&gt; singing.
&gt; In Stevenson and Fanshawe the illustrations make the two look very
&gt; similar, with friederichseni having the red extending a little further
&gt; down the back, and gierowi with a tinge of yellow gradation from the
&gt; red of the nape. This is not accurate as the attached images will
&gt; show. The red continues in friederichseni to the rump, gierowi only
&gt; has colour to the extreme of the upper back but the hind collar is
&gt; bright yellow.
&gt; Best to all
&gt; Brian
