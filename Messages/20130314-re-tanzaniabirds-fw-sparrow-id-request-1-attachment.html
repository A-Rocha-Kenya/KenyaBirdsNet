  <pre>Dear All,
It&#39;s really good to see an interest in the Grey-headed Sparrow group.
Current taxonomy (unless it has changed yet again) has lumped the
group. This is all very well, but in lumping the birds like this, we
lose valuable data once they are just under the one umbrella. Even
though the taxonimists consider just &#34;Grey-headed Sparrow&#34; I think it
remiss of us, if we do not when possible record just what Grey-headed
Sparrow it is, and it is not just with Grey-headed Sparrows., there
are other groups.
This bird appears not to be an adult, the white shoulder marking has
not developed. Otherwise the grey underparts, extensive grey mantle,
white throat and slight bill do point to Swahili. This is interesting
in that Amboseli is gongonensis territory. Swahili in Kenya is from
the lower part of Magadi Road to the border, and the eastern part of
the Maasai Mara.
Best to all
Brian

&gt; thoughts on this bird please.
&gt;
&gt; taken in Amboseli.
&gt;
&gt; to my eyes it&#39;s a Swahili with a touch of Parrot-billed !!!!!
&gt;
&gt; head not round enough for a real swahili, bill a touch large and the eye
&gt; should be more &#34;beedy&#34; looking.
&gt; but it&#39;s too pale for a gongonensis, the throat looks pale and the bill not
&gt; bulky enough.
