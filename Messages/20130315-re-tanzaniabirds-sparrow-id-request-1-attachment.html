&gt; Hi Jason and all,
&gt; Are you really serious that these two images relate to the same
&gt; individual. The right bird is 100% a Parrot-bill, and apart from quite
&gt; a number of plumage and bill structural differences, the bird on the
&gt; left is no larger that the Rufous Sparrows behind it, and PBS would be
&gt; dwarfing them.
&gt; Or is the camera doing a great con job!?
&gt; Best for now
