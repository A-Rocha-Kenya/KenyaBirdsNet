  <pre>Hi Jason and all,
Are you really serious that these two images relate to the same
individual. The right bird is 100% a Parrot-bill, and apart from quite
a number of plumage and bill structural differences, the bird on the
left is no larger that the Rufous Sparrows behind it, and PBS would be
dwarfing them.
Or is the camera doing a great con job!?
Best for now
Brian
