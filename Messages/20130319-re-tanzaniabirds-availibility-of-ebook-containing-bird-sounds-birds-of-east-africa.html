  <pre>Dear Ake,
I am not really au fait with the technology, but will tell you what I know;

The App is available at ITunes library, Apple App Store, Google Play
Store for Android devices, and Windows Phone Marketplace for Windows
Phone.
Make sure you check the comapatibility with what you have, before purchase.
It is designed for IPad and Iphone, and is not for Laptops or
Computers. The cost is $29.99 and it has been produced by My Digital
Earth.

I hope that this helps you, I really don&#39;t know if it is in Beta format or not.

Best for now
Brian

&gt;&gt; Dear All,
&gt;&gt; I promised to update on the East African Bird App.
&gt;&gt; We are making very good progress, and the App came through safely via
&gt;&gt; Safaricom and I now have it.
&gt;&gt; I am truly amazed, as I have never seen such technology before. The
&gt;&gt; production is remarkable and I highly endorse it. The calls that I
&gt;&gt; have played so far are clear and a great learning tool for the East
&gt;&gt; African avifauna. I confess I am still in the Aâ€™s! But then there are
&gt;&gt; 1300 species in EA so it will take a little while.  When I have done
&gt;&gt; this I will send amendments and corrections to My Digital Earth who
&gt;&gt; will implement them straight away.  I honestly never thought it would
&gt;&gt; be as impressive as it is.
&gt;&gt; For those that do have it, could you please send me any comments and
&gt;&gt; if you notice any errors of omissions. Please send it direct, as I
&gt;&gt; don&#39;t want to clog up the nets, but if you want to broadcast to all
&gt;&gt; feel free either positively or negatively. On receipt of your comments
&gt;&gt; I will endeavour to get things updated at the earliest.
&gt;&gt; Best to all
&gt;&gt; Brian
