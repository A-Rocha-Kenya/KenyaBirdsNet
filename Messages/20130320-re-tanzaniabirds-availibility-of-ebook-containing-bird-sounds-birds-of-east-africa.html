  <pre>Hi Ethan,
This is unplagiarised, and details of acknowledgements, authorship,
amendments and corrections have been sent to My Digital Earth who are
working on them right now, I am advised.
All authors support that it should remain available (as it was first
in place on 18th December!).
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Is this now the un-plagiarised version that we can go ahead and buy?
&gt;

&gt;&gt; Dear Ake,
&gt;&gt; I am not really au fait with the technology, but will tell you what I
&gt;&gt; know;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The App is available at ITunes library, Apple App Store, Google Play
&gt;&gt; Store for Android devices, and Windows Phone Marketplace for Windows
&gt;&gt; Phone.
&gt;&gt; Make sure you check the comapatibility with what you have, before
&gt;&gt; purchase.
&gt;&gt; It is designed for IPad and Iphone, and is not for Laptops or
&gt;&gt; Computers. The cost is $29.99 and it has been produced by My Digital
&gt;&gt; Earth.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I hope that this helps you, I really don&#39;t know if it is in Beta format
&gt;&gt; or
&gt;&gt; not.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Best for now
&gt;&gt; Brian

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear All,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I promised to update on the East African Bird App.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We are making very good progress, and the App came through safely via
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Safaricom and I now have it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am truly amazed, as I have never seen such technology before. The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; production is remarkable and I highly endorse it. The calls that I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have played so far are clear and a great learning tool for the East
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; African avifauna. I confess I am still in the Aâ€™s! But then there are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1300 species in EA so it will take a little while.  When I have done
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this I will send amendments and corrections to My Digital Earth who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will implement them straight away.  I honestly never thought it would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be as impressive as it is.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For those that do have it, could you please send me any comments and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if you notice any errors of omissions. Please send it direct, as I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don&#39;t want to clog up the nets, but if you want to broadcast to all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; feel free either positively or negatively. On receipt of your comments
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I will endeavour to get things updated at the earliest.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Best to all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Brian
