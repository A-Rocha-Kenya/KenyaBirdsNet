  <pre>Dear Ringers

A few weeks ago I submitted a request for data on swallows, martins and
swifts ringed in South Africa (message copied below). Thank you very
much to all the people who responded and are allowing me to use their
data. Every sample makes a contribution. The project is going so well
that I have decided to expand it to looking at the variation in size of
swallows, martins and swifts ringed anywhere in sub-Saharan Africa and 
associated islands.
Please, if you are willing to allow me to use your data please e-mail it
to me stevenwe@vodamail.co.za or fax it to me on 086 556 3099.

Kind regards

Steven

Dear Ringers,

I am busy with research into the variation in sizes of swallows, martins
and swifts throughout their range in South Africa. If you are willing to
share your data with me you will be acknowledged in any publications
produced using the data. If you are willing to provide me with digital
data please could you e-mail it to me stevenwe@vodamail.co.za or
analog (paper) data either post photocopies to me at the address given
below or fax it to me on 086 556 3099. For the swallows, martins and
swifts I would be happy to receive all the data you collect when ringing
and not just the data you submit to SAFRING. In addition, if you have
exact coordinates of the places you have ringed the swallows, martins or
swifts at please provide these, if not then the degrees-minutes you
submit to SAFRING will do.

Kind regards

Steven
