  <pre>Dear All,
Outside of my window, my Ruppellâ€™s Robin Chat is giving absolutely
perfect Jacobin Cuckoo calls. I am sure it is the same RRC that is
always with us, on its same territory. The mystery is that I have
never heard a Jacobin Cuckoo here, nor do I ever recall having heard
one in Nairobi National Park. Over the year we hear six cuckoo
species, we have been visited by silent Levaillant&#39;s but I have never
seen a Jocobin. How can this be? The Robin-Chat is a great mimic, but
surely it has to learn the call from the real thing!
Best to all
Brian
