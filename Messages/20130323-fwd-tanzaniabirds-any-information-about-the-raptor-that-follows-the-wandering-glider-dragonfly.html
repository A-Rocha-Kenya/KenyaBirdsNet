  <pre>Dear All,
This has just turned up on the Tanzanian Atlas net. Has anyone heard
of this, I doubt if it has been witnessed at sea. I wonder if Dino who
has studied Pantalas, has any reference to the association.
Best for now
Brian

Dear All,
I find this thought provoking. I have never heard that Amurs
deliberately move with the migrating Pantalas, but it would make sense
to travel with a food supply when traversing the Indian Ocean. Has
anyone else heard of this? Presumably Lesser Kestrels could also take
advantage of them. Could there be a major and important link between
Pantala and migrating Asian falcons. I have seen them here feeding on
large gatherings of Pantala with the accompaniment of Sootys,
Eleonoras and Eurasian Hobbys.
Best to all
Brian

&gt; Hi
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone have some information on which bird follows the migration of the
&gt; wandering glider (Pantala flavescens) dragonfly? We see this large red
&gt; dragonfly in March/April in the North Eastern Serengeti heading south. It
&gt; migrates from India to South Africa and apparently there is a bird that
&gt; follows them.
&gt;
&gt; Any information would be appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Kind Regards
&gt;
&gt; Leonie
