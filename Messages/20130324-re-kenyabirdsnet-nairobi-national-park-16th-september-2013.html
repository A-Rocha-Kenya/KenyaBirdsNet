  <pre>Dear All

We were in the park for a few hours on the afternoon of Sunday 15th. 

It was not exceptionally productive for birds. 

In addition to some of the species recorded by Brian and his team the most interesting species we saw included

Verreaux&#39;s eagle owl at the hippo pools opposite the car park (fifth time for us in the park)
Two crested francolins  also at the hippo pools car park
A very nice White phase paradise flycatcher again  at the hippo pools car park
Six white pelicans at Athi basin dam


Mammals were more exciting on this visit and included:

Three separate lion sightings, including a female with two small cubs on the outer circuit not far from the hippo pools
Serval on the outer circuit beyond the beacon
Four mountain reedbuck one Gorge up from the normal spot
One steinbok on the outer circuit (the first  that we have seen for several years) 
Forty Thompson&#39;s gazelle  in widely scattered groups (the most I recall for a while)


Lots of flowering hibiscus flavifolius


Good birding to all

Richard and Anne

NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 16th September 2013


Dear All,
With so much of the Park inaccessible with the inconsiderate closure of roads and access to major dams, once again the result was well down on what was probably present.

Although the route into the Main Entrance was more convoluted than usual because of the roadworks, the traffic flowed smoothly and Mike Davidson, Heather Elkins, Karen Plumbe and myself were all in by 6.30am, and soon through the gate.

Apart from three Suni, KWS Mess was not worth the visit, even the Black-collared Apalis was not calling today.  There was little at Ivory Burning Site except for ten or so Violet-backed Starlings. At Nagalomon Dam we also found it quiet, the Green Sandpiper was in its usual spot on the river, and a further three were at the dam, there were a pair of adult Darters, over fifteen Long-tailed Cormorants, two Black-crowned Night-Herons and a couple of a few Barn Swallows seen today.

On the back road to Hyena Dam we found nothing of note, and the dam was not too lively and produced adult Swamphen on each side of the dam, and each with a very large all grey chick, African Water Rails calling, a single Great Egret, and a Wood Sandpiper. There were a few parties of Wattled Starlings around the area. On the Hyena Dam run-off was a male Saddle-billed Stork, and a Long-crested Eagle, whilst we were very fortunate at the Martial Eagles nest, whilst watching the immature on the nest to have both adults return together.

Amazing news at Karen Primary School Dam, was that we found the female Spur-winged Goose, and every one of her seven goslings was present and healthy, which is a commendable success.

Both young Tawny Eagles were on their nest near Mbuni Picnic Site, waiting for their parents to return, and we had incredibly close views of Siffling Cisticolas here, thanks to the presence of a large Puff Adder attracting their attention.

There was a pair of Ostrich with a dozen chicks on the plains, and a distant adult Black-chested Snake-eagle and a pallid Little grebe at Eland Hollow. A Pectoral-patch Cisticola was coming into breeding plumage and was quite striking.

At the murrum pits above Athi Basin, vultures were coming in to bathe, including a pair of Lappet-faced and quite a few Ruppell&#39;s. One of the days three Common Sandpipers was here, the other two being at Athi Dam.

A little further along the road we were very fortunate in finding a White-tailed Lark feeding fairly openly on the side of the road. Hoped for Wheatears here never materialised.

Athi Dam was not too rewarding, there was an adult White Pelican, five Yellow-billed Storks, just two African Spoonbill, the only Crowned Crane of the day, four pairs of Spur-winged Plover, fifteen Kittlitz&#39;s, three Little Stint and two Common Greenshank. One Black-crowned Night-Heron roosted on the causeway.

Continuing towards Cheetah Gate, we found a couple of Secretarybirds, three White-bellied Bustards, a handful of Speckle-fronted Weavers with two attractive Grey-headed Silverbills associating with them.
Three Quailfinch were also flushed, the only birds of the day.

We were driving back just past the Rhino Circuit, towards Hippo Pools, and there were a few birds in the acacias, so to attract the attention of any other birds we were not seeing, I imitated a Pearl-spotted Owlet. A few more birds came in, and we were very surprised when a Pearl-spotted Owlet called back and was soon sitting with us. We spent ten minutes with the owlet  (the first in the Park for three years), and its entourage of Red-fronted Tinkerbird, Cardinal, Grey and Nubian Woodpeckers, Common Bulbul, Spotted Morning Thrush, White-browed Scrub-Robin, Grey Flycatcher, Rattling Cisticola, Tawny-flanked Prinia, Yellow-breasted Apalis, Grey-backed Camaroptera, Red-faced Crombec, Buff-bellied Warbler, Abyssinian White-eye, White-bellied and Red-throated Tits, Paradise Flycatcher, Chin-spot Batis, Brubru, Brown-crowned Tchagra, Sulphur-breasted Bush-Shrike, Slate-coloured and Tropical Boubous, Black Cuckoo-shrike, Common Drongo, Black-headed Oriole, Yellow-spotted Petronia, Lesser Masked Weaver, Red-billed Firefinch, Red-cheeked Cordon-bleu, Purple Grenadier, Reichenow&#39;s Seedeater and White-bellied Canary, definitely a bias to Passerines!
When migrants are around they are aggressive owl mobbers, especially Spotted Flycatchers, and many warbler species. No migrant came in to this gathering and I think it was safe to say that there were none around within hearing at least.

We took the circuit around to Kingfisher Picnic Site for the final coffee break of the day, there were Brown Parrots calling but we could not see them, and absent for quite a while, a pair of very attractive Black-winged Plovers were along the road immediately before Kingfisher. There were a few Greater Blue-eared Starlings at the site, probably attracted by something fruiting. Our last find of the day was the female Saddle-billed Stork below Impala Lookout. (So both the pair are present but independent at present).

There were about fifteen Black-shouldered Kites still present, and the total absence of Lesser Striped Swallows continued.



So in spite of KWS attempts to restrict entry and the enjoyment of our birding we still had a good day, although nothing earth-shattering.
Mammals were in reasonable numbers, not a great deal with only single White Rhino and Lion.

Best to all
Brian
