  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" ><tr><td valign="top" style="font: inherit;">Dear Brian,<br><br>Thanks for sharing this interesting information. As I was trapping some House sparrows in Isiolo two years ago( Isiolo primary school to be specific), I came across the Somali Sparrow with entirely rufous head. Unfortunately I was not able to trap one. Yes it was feeding on the ground together with with the House sparrows. I witnessed same at Garsen. but here the there more Somali sparrows and will go through my photos because I captured birds I thought were females as well.<br><br>Kind regards,<br><br>Titus.<br><br>--- On <b>Sat, 3/30/13, Brian Finch <i>&lt;birdfinch@gmail.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:<br><blockquote style="border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); margin-left: 5px; padding-left: 5px;"><br>From: Brian Finch &lt;birdfinch@gmail.com&gt;<br>Subject: [KENYABIRDSNET] OBSERVATIONS OF THE SELEMPO SPARROW AT SALA GATE, TSAVO EAST NATIONAL

      <p>OBSERVATIONS OF THE SELEMPO SPARROW AT SALA GATE,<br>
TSAVO EAST NATIONAL PARK.<br>
<br>
A year ago, Edwin Selempo was at Sala Gate with some clients, and when<br>
looking through the House Sparrows present, noticed something very<br>
different. There were House Sparrows, in amongst the House Sparrows<br>
that had entirely rich chestnut-brown heads.<br>
In January this year he showed them to David Fisher, they were still<br>
in the same location and David managed a few images. These images were<br>
then circulated to a few people for comment, and all agreed that there<br>
was something very interesting about the Selempo Sparrow.<br>
On the coast of Somalia, but in the northern hemisphere is the<br>
nominate race of Somali Sparrow, unlike our colourful yellowish race<br>
fulgens, these birds lack the yellow and instead show white cheeks and<br>
no yellow on the underparts.<br>
The conclusion amongst the few that were asked to comment was that<br>
these were for the best part the first nominate Somali Sparrow for<br>
East Africa, maybe unfairly it was mooted that they might be hybrid.<br>
<br>
On 23rd March, Mike Davidson, Nigel Hunter and myself were heading off<br>
to the coast for a few days, and were staying that night and the<br>
return night in Satao Camp in the eastern part of Tsavo East. We<br>
wanted to get some information on the birds as we passed through. They<br>
were not at the entrance gate, but at the Artefact Duka only fifty<br>
metres away. Here they fed on the ground with normal House Sparrows,<br>
and the staff fed the birds and also provided a bird bath. They looked<br>
content with their lot! We estimated that there were five male Selempo<br>
Sparrows, and did not know what the females looked like or if they<br>
would be separable from female House Sparrow. (One of the images with<br>
a male shows a female with unmarked shoulders, that may be it).<br>
<br>
We studied the birds, took images and video, and on the return journey<br>
were able to show them to Fleur Ng’Weno. We made a very good contact<br>
with a KWS fellow at the gate, who was most interested and wanted to<br>
assist in trapping the birds for blood specimens. These details have<br>
been sent to Colin Jackson who will handle the project. It will be<br>
interesting to see how the dna also compares with their House Sparrow<br>
friends, to see if there has been some dilution.<br>
<br>
We looked carefully at the birds, and could not see any sign that they<br>
were hybridising.<br>
The males showed all chestnut heads, very bright white cheeks unlike<br>
the dirty white of House Sparrow, the entire underparts instead of<br>
being the dirty white of House Sparrow were an attractive soft grey.<br>
We thought it better to call them Selempo Sparrow as Edwin deserves<br>
all the credit for bringing attention to them, until we can confirm<br>
that they are Somali Sparrow of the nominate race, which I personally<br>
feel they are.<br>
<br>
How nominate Somali Sparrow males differ from House Sparrow males.<br>
<br>
S has entirely chestnut top to head continuous to base of bill.<br>
H has entirely grey top to head from base of bill, chestnut only on<br>
sides of head.<br>
<br>
S adults show extensive black breast patch with scalloping down to breast.<br>
H usually has more confined patch, most lacking scalloped effect.<br>
<br>
S has pure white cheek patch sharply contrasting with soft grey underparts.<br>
H has white cheeks and grey tinged underparts, but not contrasting.<br>
<br>
S has no conspicuous white band across carpal.<br>
H invariably shows obvious white band across carpal.<br>
<br>
S has entirely rich rufous secondary coverts.<br>
H shows the edges of  the secondary coverts rufous brown, most of<br>
inner edge of feather black.<br>
<br>
S has pale grey back with silvery grey and black streaks.<br>
H shows rufous-brown back with cream and blackish streaking.<br>
<br>
S Show rufous edging to primaries<br>
H show creamy-brown edges to primaries.<br>
<br>
The Selempo Sparrows at Sala Gate show every one of these nominate<br>
castanopterus characters. There is no indication of these appearing in<br>
the House Sparrows, but no two House Sparrows are alike, they are<br>
always so highly variable.<br>
<br>
Whilst dna testing will tell, I cannot see how they could ever be<br>
freakish House Sparrows or hybrids with some other Kenyan Sparrow.<br>
<br>
Now we come to the question of provenance. I have no explanation.<br>
In Somalia this form occurs along the coast as far south as 1o North<br>
but not even reaching Mogadishu (as far as is known).  Could it have<br>
come as ship assisted, landed in Malindi as multiple individuals,<br>
which seems so unlikely, then followed the road to Tsavo East.<br>
Could there be little populations scattered in the bush that has<br>
allowed for again multiple birds to arrive at Sala Gate. Is it<br>
possible that they are out there and no-one has noticed them until<br>
Edwin found them?<br>
<br>
I would imagine that these questions won’t ever be answered, but there<br>
is no denying that they are there.<br>
<br>
Best to all,<br>
Brian<br>
