<BR>
A fabulous boat trip from Kipini to Lake Mbililo in the Tana Delta took place on March 20, on a day of brilliant sun, towering clouds and thunderstorms &#8211; breathtaking scenery. Participants included Omar Bocha, Omari Ngama, Jonathan Mwachongo, myself (Fleur Ng&#8217;weno), the boat captains and accompanying administration policemen (who thoroughly enjoyed the outing). Highlights include:<BR>
<BR>
Birds of Prey:<BR>
Peregrine Falcon<BR>
European Honey Buzzard <BR>
African Fish Eagle (at least 7)<BR>
Black-chested Snake Eagle<BR>
Eurasian Marsh Harrier<BR>
<BR>
Waterbirds<BR>
Little Grebe (immatures, on the river)<BR>
Pacific Golden Plover (about 40, some in spring plumage)<BR>
Black-headed Gull (1 at Kipini, in winter plumage)<BR>
African Skimmer (34)<BR>
<BR>
The next day, March 21, we were at Dida Waride. There were large numbers of waterbirds on the flood plain, wagtails in the grass and warblers in the reeds. Highlights include:<BR>
<BR>
Garganey (4, in spring plumage)<BR>
Lesser Swamp Warbler<BR>
Sedge Warbler<BR>
And a small, rufous Warbler with a squeaky, scratchy song in the sedges. After considerable discussion with other birders, we are calling it an &nbsp;African Reed Warbler.<BR>
<BR>
Wishing you good birding, Fleur<BR>
