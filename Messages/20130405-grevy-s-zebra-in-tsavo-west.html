The co-ordinates put the Grevy&#39;s south of Chyulus, has anyone ever
seen a Grevy&#39;s in the south before, or even in the Tsavos. I suppose
they could wander in to the far NE of Tsavo East, but that is not an
area that many people have ever visited with the history of Somali
banditry.

Best to all
Brian
