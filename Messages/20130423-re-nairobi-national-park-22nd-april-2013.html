&gt; NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 22nd April 2013
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Dear All,
&gt;
&gt; On 22nd April, Mike Davidson, Fleur Ng&#39;Weno, Jennifer O&#39;duore and
&gt; myself met at the Main Entrance to Nairobi National Park at 6.30am
&gt; having had light traffic en route.
&gt; It had been dry since Friday night, apart from light showers, although
&gt; an extremely heavy dew covered the vegetation.
&gt;
&gt; We started the day at KWS Mess Garden, nothing too much of interest
&gt; was happening, the Black-collared Apalis was singing. Continuing to
&gt; Nagalomon Dam we were to find over eighty Black-crowned Night-Herons
&gt; sitting on the typha, many birds sitting on eggs whilst others still
&gt; constructing and posturing comically.There was also a male Darter
&gt; present, a single Swamphen,  a nearby adult Fish Eagle which was very
&gt; vocal and a watchful Long-crested Eagle.  As Fleur wanted to leave at
&gt; 9.00am we hung around Ivory Burning Site until near that hour. There
&gt; was still a Garden Warbler singing from dense cover. Whilst having our
&gt; picnic breakfast, a small raptor flew in. Expecting it to be a Gabar
&gt; Goshawk we were very surprised to see that is was not, but an immature
&gt; Shikra, only one previous record for NNP, by Simon Thomsett. Other
&gt; local records are few and far between in the Nairobi district. The
&gt; bird made a dive at some perched doves, which scattered, but it
&gt; probably wanted the perch rather than the doves. After resting a
&gt; while, it took off and was immediately harassed by local swallows and
&gt; swifts as it spent some time soaring in tight circles with its
&gt; entourage until very high and finally disappeared towards the
&gt; south-west.
&gt; Today was the first days release of the Nairobi National Park Bird
&gt; Checklist available from both Nature Kenya and Fonnap. (All proceeds
&gt; generated are being equally divided between the two organisations). It
&gt; was remarked that with the launch of the checklist a new bird would
&gt; turn up on that date, so that it would be &#34;out of date&#34; immediately.
&gt; Whilst this was not new for the Park it was the first any of us had
&gt; seen in NNP, and only the second record!
&gt;
&gt; Mikes car tyre was flattening before our eyes, so dropping Fleur off
&gt; at the gate worked well as he had to disappear for a short while, to
&gt; have a nail removed as it turns out. The remainder of us waited in the
&gt; car park, and found a pair of Northern Double-collared Sunbirds nest
&gt; building. There was also a stunning Fig Tree Blue feeding on a
&gt; Spathodea flower.
&gt;
&gt; On his return we went off to Hyena Dam, but it was far too late for
&gt; any activity and we were rewarded only by a friendly Water Rail, and
&gt; another cup of coffee.
&gt;
&gt; The water had subsided sufficiently to allow us to pass through the
&gt; run-off, but all we found down here were a few Jackson&#39;s Widowbirds.
&gt; On arriving along the Mokoyeti there was a latish Common Buzzard and
&gt; continuing on to Eland Hollow, the dam only offered up single
&gt; White-faced Whistling Duck and Red-billed Teal. Nearby the resident
&gt; pair of Spotted Thick-knees were incubating one egg. Driving towards
&gt; Karen Primary School Dam, I saw a very large bird and said that there
&gt; was a Marabou out there, but then asked Mike if he would stop as it
&gt; was behaving differently and though it might be a Martial Eagle. We
&gt; stopped and I could see immediately that is was a very large
&gt; Long-legged Buzzard. What was interesting about this bird was that I
&gt; am sure that it was exactly the same individual that was on this same
&gt; plain early last May. It&#39;s feature that renders it distinct from other
&gt; LLB, is that it completely lacks rufous in the plumage. I sent images
&gt; of the bird to Itai last year and he confirmed that the bird was the
&gt; uncommon brown phase. All other LLB I have seen in Kenya have been
&gt; rufous birds, so a brown bird on the same place in successive years is
&gt; strongly supporting that the same individual is involved.
&gt;
&gt; We continued across towards Kingfisher not finding anything else much
&gt; to report.
&gt;
&gt; On a disappointing note here in the third week of April we could only
&gt; find one Red-backed and four Lesser Grey Shrikes. There should be
&gt; hundreds of them by now. Only six Barn Swallows were seen all day as
&gt; well, and the only migrant warbler was the single Garden.
&gt;
&gt; It was a very nice day, the weather was cool but bright, mammals have
&gt; obviously had a major movement down to the south, where we did not
&gt; visit. We were through the gate at 3.15pm.
&gt;
&gt; Best to all
&gt; Brian
