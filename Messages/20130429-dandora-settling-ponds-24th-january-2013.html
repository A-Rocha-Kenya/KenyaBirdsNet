  <pre>DANDORA SETTLING PONDS 24th January 2013.

As part of the waterbird count, Mike Davidson, Jennifer Oduore, Salma
Watt and myself patrolled one fifth of the enormous area. I am not
sure what the species recorded by  the other teams were, I do know
that after we left, a male Tufted Duck was found on another tank. On
our section we did have three Black-headed Gulls, a couple of
Whiskered, fifteen White-winged Black and a Gull-billed Tern, good
numbers of Wood Sandpipers and Ruff, but few other waders, nothing
more interesting than a Ringed Plover. There were 84 Garganey, but no
other palearctic ducks, a Western Marsh Harrier, some 100 Yellow
Wagtails  of which the most interesting was a male Black-headed Yellow
Wagtail (feldegg), the first I have ever seen around Nairobi.

Best to all
Brian
