  <hr/>
  <pre>Our May Day treat was having a Corncrake burst out of the long grass beside us as we walked along a dirt track near our house. No other palearctic migrants this week. Madagascar bee eaters have arrived, we had a flock of about 50 heading east but some seem to be staying around for the moment.
