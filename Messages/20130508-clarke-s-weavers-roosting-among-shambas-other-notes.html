    Following on from the news that Fleur and the Dakatcha Woodland
    Conservation Group found Clarke's Weavers nesting in a small
    seasonal swamp, David Ngala - the renowned bird guide from
    Arabuko-Sokoke Forest and recently awarded the Disney Global
    Conservation Hero Award - was returning from doing one of his
    surveys of illegal activities in the forest and stopped by a tiny
    wetland just outside the boundary of the forest at the southern end
    which was swarming with weavers of various kinds. In the middle of
    Golden Palm and Grosbeak Weavers he noticed a female Clarke's Weaver
    and ended up staying a further two hours to confirm it leading to
    his seeing more females and then also some male Clarke's Weavers
    coming into the wetland. <br>
    <br>
    He called other A Rocha Kenya staff to go back there with him that
    same day to confirm it (I was unfortunately away in Naivasha) so
    Henry Kigen + 3-4 others accompanied him back that evening and fully
    confirmed Clarke's Weavers present in a small seasonal swamp near
    Chumani on the south boundary of Arabuko-Sokoke.<br>
    <br>
    This is also therefore very ground breaking news. Whether they were
    actually breeding there was not certain and so last Friday (3rd May)
    I visited the site with 12 other visitors, volunteers and staff to
    do some further observations. On arrival at 5pm there were just a
    handful of birds in the sedges but over the next hour c.250 more
    Clarke's Weavers came into the reedbed from out of Arabuko-Sokoke
    and settled in the sedges with Golden Palm and Grosbeak Weavers.
    With careful observation we looked hard for any evidence of breeding
    activity and whilst we saw 2-3 female-plumaged birds entering a
    couple of nests, there was no evidence of real breeding behaviour -
    in fact two males seen were well on the way to moulting into
    non-breeding plumage.<br>
    <br>
    The final assessment therefore is that whilst they may have nested
    there earlier in the season, currently they are not nesting but are
    in fact roosting in the seasonal swamp. This is new information for
    the species as the roost site and behaviour have also never been
    described. We'll be publishing a full report on this in Scopus in
    due course.<br>

    An additional bonus while there was a Bat Hawk cruising over head at
    dusk...<br>
    <br>
    Arabuko-Sokoke Forest yesterday in pouring rain in the morning
    surveying other seasonal wetlands in the southern end of the forest.
    Some beautiful habitat in that area; one wetland in particular was
    significant in size (200x100m) and had Black Crakes in it and, most
    surprisingly, the southern race (species?) of Little Rush Warbler
    singing away in the sedges (and another Bat Hawk over mid morning in
    pouring rain).<br>
    <br>
    Sabaki River Mouth today - very few birds. The estuary has <i>totally</i>
    changed with the flooding that has happened the past month and the
    sea has been pushed even further back by vast amounts of mud and
    sand that have been deposited from eroded shambas in Ukambani.. WHEN
    will our Agricultural Department get its act together to enforce the
    law that prevents people from farming right up to a river bank and
    thus reduce the amount of erosion of top soil into the rivers and
    eventually the ocean??<br>
    <br>
    Highlights were a handful of Collared Pratincoles (no Mad Prats -
    unlike last month when we had over 600...), one White-cheeked Tern
    amongst c.100 Common Terns, four Caspian Terns, and a pair of
    Black-winged Stilt on the now wonderfully flooded freshwater pans in
    behind the shoreline. These promise to be very rich with birds once
    they start to 'mature'.<br>
