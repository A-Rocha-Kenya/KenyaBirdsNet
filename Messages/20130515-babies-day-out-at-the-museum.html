Two consecutive Wednesday Morning Birdwalks on the grounds of the National Museums in Nairobi produced an impressive array of nestlings, juveniles and immatures:<BR>
<BR>

Great Sparrowhawk on its old nest in a big eucalyptus (some birds <I>like</I> eucalyptus) with two snowy-white downy nestlings<BR>
Juvenile Klaas's Cuckoo being fed by a pair of African Paradise Flycatchers on 8 May<BR>
Singing Cisticola with just-fledged, short-tailed young on May 8<BR>
Common Bulbul feeding nestlings in a Dracaena plant on May 15<BR>
Collared Sunbird feeding fledgling on May 15<BR>
and immatures of Cinnamon-chested Bee-eaters, Common Fiscal, Black-backed Puff-back, Olive Thrush and African Pied Wagtail<BR>
