  <pre>Hi Matt,
You are completely right, which is why I qualified conditions after
saying it was a good idea. You have to remove hundreds of variables to
justify the eye-dropper testing method, however if you have a bird in
the field that is part of a group, you should be able to compare
colour points on those individuals providing it is a high quality
image, and it was something I had never considered before.
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Most species of bird show very little (almost none to our eyes) variation
&gt; except for age/sex/breeding plumage/wear, or geographical variation which
&gt; may be distinguished as a separate subspecies. A small number e.g. many *
&gt; Buteo*/*Pernis*, do show considerable individual variation. There is also
&gt; the problem of abnormalities such as albinism, leucism etc. etc.
&gt; When an individual such as Brian&#39;s pipit shows a plumage variation that is
&gt; outside the above then birders get &#39;fussed&#39;.

&gt;&gt; Brian,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; When I first became seriously interested in birds in 1950s there were
&gt;&gt; birds that could not be identified - they were called &#39;hoodwinks&#39;.
&gt;&gt; However,
&gt;&gt; hubris has ruled, and we expect to be able to identify everything. Your
&gt;&gt; pipit is a reminder that hoodwinks still exist.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear All,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Many, many thanks to all those who contributed to find an identity for
&gt;&gt;&gt; the strange green Tree Pipit seen on the Ngong Hills, alongside a
&gt;&gt;&gt; normal Tree Pipit.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have attached the thread of correspondence showing peoples arguments
&gt;&gt;&gt; for and against the identity of the bird being an Olive-backed Pipit
&gt;&gt;&gt; or Tree Pipit.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; It makes for a very interesting and educational read, and the final
&gt;&gt;&gt; conclusion is that this was a very, very strange bird, and specific
&gt;&gt;&gt; identity will always be a mystery.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; What I have personally learnt is; if there are two rarities around at
&gt;&gt;&gt; the same time, make sure each receives fair attention! A green Tree
&gt;&gt;&gt; Pipit might be just a green Tree Pipit. Not everything seen can be
&gt;&gt;&gt; labelled (certainly something that I have already learnt from not
&gt;&gt;&gt; being able to identify many Aquila Eagles). All Tree Pipits in future
&gt;&gt;&gt; will require more than a casual glance. Olive-backed Pipit is not an
&gt;&gt;&gt; impossibility to appear in East Africa one day. That there are
&gt;&gt;&gt; instances of wild hybridisation of Pipits, including three involving
&gt;&gt;&gt; Tree Pipits (see attached details). That Killian’s method of colour
&gt;&gt;&gt; sampling on the computer using the photo programmes eye-dropper tool
&gt;&gt;&gt; is a brilliant idea, (providing the images were taken with identical
&gt;&gt;&gt; settings etc). Finally I really don’t want to see an identical bird to
&gt;&gt;&gt; this one again!
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Again many thanks for this educative trail,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Brian
&gt;&gt;&gt;
