  <pre>Dear All,
An update on the Orchid on the Magadi Road last Sunday.

This in from Benny Bytebier, now in RSA.

Hi,
This is indeed Habenaria helicoplectrum. I have actually seen that
population at exactly the same spot.
It is an endemic of Kenya and Tanzania. It is not common but because
it grows in dry areas where nobody looks for orchids, it is probably
overlooked and underrecorded.
Benny
