  <pre> Hi birders, 

During last weekend i and other three friends we went out on friday 31st/may,main plan was to bird in lake baringo. On our way the first day we camped at information center at the equator,arrival time was around 3:30pm and after putting our tents we left to the Emining hills,at the toes hills there rivers were in one spot we spoted some highland species e.g Yellow whiskered greenbul,Crowned hornbill,slender billed greenbul,variable sunbird,green pigeon and the unusual one Grey throated barbets which in the map of population its just indicated in kakamega and nandi forest,these group was nesting along the river in a fig tree (ficus sur),this was a colony of about 15 birds some being juveniles showing 100% percent juvenile plumage.that single branch has more than ten holes in it which are active.
   The place is hot and this but all these highland species! after all it was still quite something to site the barbet there and left alot of questions within us because of the distance between emining hills and nandi hills and i found it quite something to share with my friends and here from you too.
  The Saturday morning we went to the Sawaitii swamp at Mogotio amazingly the whole swamp has birds breeding  in hundreds or it could go up to thousands,this is a true breeding area which should be protected with hundreds of Catlle egrets,glossy ibises,black crowned night heron,sacred ibises,long tailed comorants,spoon bills and maybe more other species that we saw and could be also breeding there.                 
These are important bird areas.
