  <pre>Hi Edwin,
Sorry this is a Little Bee-eater. It must have been down a hole a long
time, as is not exactly looking sleek. May be a young bird moulting
into first adult plumage. Blue-breasted (BBBE) differ from Littles in
a number of small aspects. They do not possess a blue eye-brow line as
this bird, but have a short bluish-white crescent above the eye,
otherwise the mask is all blackish. directly below the mask BBBE show
pale yellow, rear of the eye in the corner of the gorget, this is very
whitish with no hint of yellow, this Little has a pale indication of
whitish below the mask for the entire length which suggests that it is
a lighting or even moulting effect, also it&#39;s creamy white including
the chin, BBBE have a clear lemon-yellow chin. Also BBBE has a
distinctly broad blue band below the gorget, which is narrow,
incomplete and black in this bird.
I would like to see images of the coucal from Joy&#39;s Camp, it sounds interesting,
Very best for now
Brian

&gt; Dear Birders Michael Graham recently forwarded us this

&gt; The shape and posture suggests a Little Bee-eater but on further
&gt; examination I can see white below the birds black mask. I wonder if this is
&gt; discoloration
&gt; caused by the light angle and probably lead Michael to his ID.
&gt; “Whilst at Loisaba we
&gt; saw a Blue-breasted Bee-eater (also photographed and now confirmed as
&gt; definite). I would like to advise a Kenya Bird Club of the rare sighting
&gt; and
&gt; send a picture. This bird lives in the swamps of Lake Victoria. We also saw
&gt; Senegal Coucal at Joy&#39;s Camp. Was living in the tall thick-stemmed reeds
&gt; that
&gt; look like Sugar Cane (it&#39;s usual habitat).”
