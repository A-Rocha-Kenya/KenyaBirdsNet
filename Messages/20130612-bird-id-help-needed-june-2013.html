Your help would be greatly appreciated and I would welcome any and all comments. <o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>On June the 2<sup>nd</sup> we found what we presume to be a Common Redshank at Lake Nakuru National Park. Please find attached a picture of this bird. From the field guide this bird is not common inland and certainly should not be here in June. From the photo can anyone confirm that this is indeed a Common Redshank? <o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>On the 5<sup>th</sup> of June my friends and I ventured into the Kerio valley and we were fortunate to find a Gambaga Flycatcher, two Chestnut-crowned Sparrow-weavers and a Stripe-breasted Seedeater all in the same tree. While we were watching these birds Boran Cistciola and White-crested Turaco&#8217;s were calling in the valley below. For those of you that have not traveled to this part of the country it is spectacular and the birds are fantastic. <o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>On the 6<sup>th</sup> of June we were in Kakamega Forest. Highlights were two sightings of African Shrike Flycatchers, an African Broadbill, and an unusually obliging Black-billed Turaco that posed for a few shots. Please find one attached. <o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>The 7<sup>th</sup> of June was spent near Busia and Mumias. We unfortunately broke down in Mumias and spent three hours in sugar cane fields searching for any birds we could find. We happened across a few Bee-eaters that I&#8217;m guessing are Blue-breasted Bee-eaters. Please find attached two images of these birds. They were working the edge of the sugar cane fields and a marshy area nearby. With the recent discussion on this forum surrounding Blue-breasted Bee-eaters can anyone either confirm or refute my identification. I have never seen this species in Kenya before and would love some feedback. <o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>On the 10<sup>th</sup> of June we were driving between Talek and Keekerok in the Mara Reserve. We were watching a Coqui Francolin walk down the road and into the grass when suddenly a nightjar was flushed by the francolin. It landed on the road and then scuttled into the grass. The brief look I had at the bird grabbed my attention and we drove down the road towards where the bird disappeared with cameras ready. It flushed as we drove by and we were able to snap some shots of it before it dove back into the grass. Can anyone confirm from the images attached that this is indeed a Swamp Nightjar. I have never seen this species before and from the range map it appears to be very rare in the Mara.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>Other interesting sightings from the trip that you all might find interesting were a brief encounter with a Brush-tailed Porcupine in daylight in Kakamega. A Forest Night Adder in Kakamega swallowing a frog on the trail and 4 African Wild Dogs hunting on the road between Lemek and Aitong. <o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>Take Care everyone and I appreciate all help with identification in advance.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>Regards,<o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>Stratton Hatfield<o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p></div></body></html>
