Conference Location

San Carlos de Bariloche, usually known as Bariloche, is a city in the 
province of Río Negro, Argentina, situated in the foothills of the Andes on the 
southern shores of Nahuel Huapi lake and is surrounded by the Nahuel Huapi 
National Park.  After an extensive public works and architectural buildup the 
city emerged in the 1930s and 1940s as a major tourism centre with ski, 
trekking and mountaineering facilities apart from numerous restaurants, cafés 
and chocolate shops. The city has a permanent population of 108,205 according 
to the 2010 census.

Bariloche has a cool Mediterranean climate with dry, windy summers and 
rainy winters, which grades to an alpine sub polar oceanic climate at higher 
altitudes. Generally speaking, the summer season (mid-December to early March) 
is characterized by long stretches of windy, sunny weather, with pleasant 
afternoons of 18 to 26 °C (64 to 79 °F) and cold nights of 2 to 9 °C (36 to 48 
°F). Autumn brings colder temperatures in March, then stormier weather in 
April and May. By mid-May the first snows fall, and winter lasts until early 
September, bringing stormy weather with mixed precipitation (snow, rain, 
sleet), occasional snowstorms and highs between 0 and 12 °C (32 and 54 °F), 
lows between -12 and 4 °C (10 and 39 °F). Spring is very windy and variable; 
temperatures may reach 25 °C (77 °F) in October and then plummet to -6 °C (21 
°F) following a late-season snowfall. On average, there are a handful of 
snowy days between 5 and 15 centimeters (2 and 6 in) every year, and many more 
days with mixed precipitation.

Process

Our conference registration is being handled by the Event Espresso 
software. We received feedback from conference registrants that some computers can 
not use the add to cart feature on the registration page. We suggest trying 
different internet browsers or an alternate computer. The problem seems to 
stem from a setting on the computer or network that is blocking the Event 
Espresso program. We have attempted and are unable to resolve the problem with 
the software. Our conference organizers are willing to assist you with an 
alternative registration process. Please contact Miguel Saggese for assistance 
barilocheraptors2013@gmail.com. Thank you for your patience and we look 
forward to helping you register!
