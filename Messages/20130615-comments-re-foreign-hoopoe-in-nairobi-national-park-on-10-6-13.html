  <pre>Dear All,
For those interested, I have attached the results of the recent
research into the racial identity of the epops-type Hoopoe at Athi
Dam, NNP last Monday 10th June 2013.

All of the comments have originated from contributors of the Tanzanian
Brd Atlas.

The conclusions reached were that there is still no satisfactory way
to i.d. with certainty the races senegalensis and wailbeli from each
other.

The bird in NNP was in all likelihood a waibeli, (which is an
interesting record in itself). though showing pale plumage.

Best to all
Brian
