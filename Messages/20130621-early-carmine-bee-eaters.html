  <hr/>
  <pre>About 10 days ago I heard what I could have sworn was a Carmine 
Bee-eater but thought I was imagining it so early. Then two days ago, 
yesterday and again just now we&#39;ve had small flocks passing overhead 
going south. Seems very early for them to be moving...

Also an Osprey seen both on Sunday 16th June and again yesterday. 
Presumably a non-breeding bird that didn&#39;t return to Europe?

Sunbirds are all over in large numbers here - we&#39;ve been catching many 
Amethyst and some Purple-banded neither of which are common at the A 
Rocha Kenya centre the rest of the year.

An African Broadbill on the Gede Nature Trail of Arabuko-Sokoke Forest 
at the end of May is my first there. It was doing its &#39;brrrrrrrip!&#39; 
display not far from where we were netting for the ringing course we ran 
but we didn&#39;t catch it!

The other excitement in ASF that time was opening the nets before dawn 
on the 4th morning and looking for elephant footprints in case they&#39;d 
been around in the night and instead seeing... lion footprints!! Two of 
the team had seen the tail of what they said was a cat disappearing into 
the forest in the headlights of the car as we first entered the forest - 
it must have been the owner of the footprints. Adds a different 
perspective on opening nets in dense forest in the dark...!!
