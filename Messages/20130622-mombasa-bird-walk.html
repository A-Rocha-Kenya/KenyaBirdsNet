<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dear Birders,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Back from all the exotic birding I did while in 
Nairobi I was hoping our bird walk would be prolific and was not 
disappointed.&nbsp; Outside the Nguuni Sanctuary (cheaper than going in) nearly 
all the grass had been burned off and having bravely said there are nearly 
always Carmine Bee Eaters on burned grass I was very relieved to see that my 
prediction was true.&nbsp; Admitted only a single one of the wire but in company 
with a bigger flock of White Throated.&nbsp; The first little pond had lots of 
regular birds.&nbsp; No Golden Weavers but lots of Grosbeak and African Golden 
Palm.&nbsp; Special was a Sedge Warbler but not many migrant waders; only a 
single Wood Sandpiper and a Green flying off as we reached the wetland 
area.&nbsp; Plenty of Barn Swallows and all of the herons and egrets the most 
spectacular being the Black Heron which came right up to the fence and proceded 
to give us a wonderful display of its fishing technique.&nbsp; Difficult to see 
into the wetland as it has become overgrown.&nbsp; Purle Swamphens live in there 
but we didn't see any. Sadly no MPHs. &nbsp;Lots of Yellow Wagtails moved in 
from the grassland to bathe at the edge of the pool before returning to the 
trees as we were leaving&nbsp;to roost.&nbsp; Their colours went from nearly all 
white to nearly all yellow.&nbsp; I must learn all the race names 
sometime!&nbsp; 41 species in about 2 hours.&nbsp; Bird walks are never 
disappointing.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
