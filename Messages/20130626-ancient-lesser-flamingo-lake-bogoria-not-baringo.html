  <pre>Dear all - it has been wonderful to see the incredible response to the 
news of the 50+ year old Lesser Flamingo and I think the news has almost 
gone viral across the planet! Ken, of BirdLife Africa, is putting 
something up on the BirdLife website about it and quite astutely noted 
that I had written &#34;L. Baringo&#34; when in fact there are very few 
(never??) flamingos on Baringo and instead they are on Bogoria. He&#39;s 
correct - it was a simple typo and the correct location was in fact Lake 
Bogoria - a distance of 242kms from where it was ringed in Lake Magadi.

Other news from here in Watamu - Carmine Bee-eaters moving over in small 
groups almost daily;

Sabaki waterbird count at the w/e had a few Curlew Sand and Lesser Sand  
(c. 150 + 80) but otherwise very quiet. One Caspian Tern is out of 
season, a handful of non-breeding Common Terns and Saunders&#39; Terns; the 
seasonal fresh-water pools are still wet between the dunes and the sea 
and we had four Greater Painted Snipe which are not common for us as 
well as a dozen or so Senegal Plovers.

Great weather here in Watamu right now - cool and fresh but not cold.

Best
