      <div>Dear all - it has been wonderful to see the incredible response to the <br>
news of the 50+ year old Lesser Flamingo and I think the news has almost <br>
gone viral across the planet! Ken, of BirdLife Africa, is putting <br>
something up on the BirdLife website about it and quite astutely noted <br>
that I had written "L. Baringo" when in fact there are very few <br>
(never??) flamingos on Baringo and instead they are on Bogoria. He's <br>
correct - it was a simple typo and the correct location was in fact Lake <br>
Bogoria - a distance of 242kms from where it was ringed in Lake Magadi.<br>
<br>
Other news from here in Watamu - Carmine Bee-eaters moving over in small <br>
groups almost daily;<br>
<br>
Sabaki waterbird count at the w/e had a few Curlew Sand and Lesser Sand  <br>
(c. 150 + 80) but otherwise very quiet. One Caspian Tern is out of <br>
season, a handful of non-breeding Common Terns and Saunders' Terns; the <br>
seasonal fresh-water pools are still wet between the dunes and the sea <br>
and we had four Greater Painted Snipe which are not common for us as <br>
well as a dozen or so Senegal Plovers.<br>
<br>
Great weather here in Watamu right now - cool and fresh but not cold.<br>
<br>
Best<br>
