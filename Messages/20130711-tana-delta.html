  <pre>I have been quite for a while, this is due to flooding that we had since April.
last month i observed new young bird, Sacred ibis with lots,Jacanas and two Martial eagle where one seemed to me as juvenile too.
Know the birds are showing up and lots of wetland have emerged with water Lilly covering up.
The place looks to be paradise once more

Tana Delta is Well coming you too bird with Us.
