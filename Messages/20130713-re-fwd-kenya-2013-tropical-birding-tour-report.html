  <pre>Hi all.

I have been unable to open any attachments that have been posted by any members of the group for some time now. Does any one know how this can be fixed? Is this something that I need to be given special privileges for by the group administrator? Is anyone else experiencing this problem?

Any information at all would be useful. I would love to read Adam&#39;s mouth-watering-looking trip report, as well as some of the others I have already missed out on!

Thanks and kind regards.
Felix
