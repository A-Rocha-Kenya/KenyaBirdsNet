  <pre>At the weekend i had opportunity to do Birding at Arabuko Sokoke Forest at Mixed and Brachystegia woodland.
I had good morning birding with a Photographer who intended to photograph birds at the forest.
He Managed to take some photos of Oriole, chestnut fronted helmet shrike, Dark back weaver, Collared sun bird and others, his Camera had big time deal to take photos as the weather was not good it could take a minute before it respond and when the birds sees him pointing lance toward them.Black and white cuckoo, Black cuckoo shrike male and red capped robin chat were my birds of the day.
At the Creek where it is open he had good time taking photos to birds at a close range.
What i Observed at the Creek.around 70 percent of Crab plovers were juveniles or sub adult, where there plumage was still greyish and not white.this was time where the tide was moving out.
