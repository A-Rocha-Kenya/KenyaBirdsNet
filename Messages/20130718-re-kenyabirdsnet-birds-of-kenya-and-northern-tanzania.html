  <pre>Hi Wouter,
I think that T&amp;Z will be available as an enhanced e-book sometime this
year, S&amp;F will be an enhanced e-book next year, and Horn of Africa an
enhanced e-book late this year. All will have new plates, all will
have the sounds. Not too sure how much more use 2005 will be compared
to the original. S&amp;F is already available for download for the old
addition, but does include the calls. (Available on ITunes)
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Dear All,
&gt;
&gt; I&#39;m still using the Birds of Kenya and Northern Tanzania from Zimmerman,
&gt; Turner and Pearson from 1996.
&gt; On the internet I can find two revised editions. The last one from 2005.
&gt; Does anybody know if there will
&gt; be another revised edition in the near future?
&gt; And is it worth it to get my hands on the revised edition from 2005 when I&#39;m
&gt; currently using 1996?
&gt;
&gt; Best wishes,
&gt; Wouter Bol
