  <pre>July records, it has been observed that this month has been new birds starting to do their first flights from nesting period.most birds at shrub land managed to bring up new nestling. the birds as white browed sparrow weaver, superb starling, white browed coucal and more have been along the road feeding young ones and young ones begging for food.
 it has been noted that after floods now the population of pink back pelican and long tail comorants are showing up, as this general means fish has well breed at the swamps and even the fishermen are fishing more fish. 
Birding at the site is more promising for wetlands and water is most covered by lily.
Great birding time.
