  <pre>LAKE MAGADI  11th AUGUST 2013

Nigel Hunter and myself left my house at 6.20am, and had an almost
trafficless passage through Ongata Rongai. There was a single Cape
Rook near Kiserian, but we did not stop for birds until we reached the
dam shortly before Ol Tepesi. The bridge over the Ol Kejo River is
being repaired and the road now goes through the dry river bed. The
condition of the main road is pitiful, and far from comfortable.

We thought that by going down the Magadi Road, we would escape the
cool of the highlands, but the sun did not come out until after
11.00am and up to that point it was more comfortable to wear a sweater
even around the lake! When the sun won out, the temperatures rocketed
up.

At the dam before Ol Tepesi, there were large numbers of birds coming
in to drink, even though it was only just after 9.00am and still very
cool. Most were Chestnut Sparrows in an amazing variety of plumages
from full non-breeding to full breeding, with every conceivable
transition. The second commonest was Red-billed Quelea, all were in
non-breeding except for one full breeding plumaged male. After this it
was a smattering of many species, African Silverbill, Cut-throat,
Blue-capped Cordon-bleu, Red-billed Firefinch, a female plumaged
Straw-tailed Whydah, White-bellied Canary, Grey-capped Social Weaver,
a single House Sparrow, two Swahili Sparrows completed the seedeaters,
as well as Namaqua Dove and Blue-naped Mousebird. It was an
interesting break in the journey, (see image).

We also stopped briefly at the Olorgesailie River, where there was a
Greenshank. The next stop was the causeway before the Magadi Township
barrier. Here there were a number of Ruff, a few Little Stints and one
Curlew Sandpiper. However there were good numbers of Chestnut-banded
Plovers, and one pair had a chick. It must not have been long out of
the egg, a very improbable bird with huge legs and a tiny fluffy body
that looked balanced on the top of the legs, (see images). It was
already precocious and feeding quite independently. There were a
number of both Flamingos, Black-winged Stilts and Avocets.
