  <pre>Dear All,
This attitude is perfectly correct, we have to do everything to
protect our habitats to protect the birds themselves. Every habitat
needs a flagship species, and Papyrus Gonolek is a prime candidate. No
papyrus, no Papyrus Gonolek or other papyrus exclusive species.
It should under no circumstances be downlisted,
Best to all
Brian

&gt; This is not good news to the kind of bird species that are dependent on
&gt; papyrus. It may have started with the Gonoleks btu bearing in mind the fact
&gt; that papyrus reeds are being highly extracted for basket making, other
&gt; species that may need this habitat to survive are as well at risk. I have
&gt; seen swamps that are dominated by papyrus reeds and even closer to major
&gt; institutions yet no one has taken initiative to protect them. Marula swamp
&gt; near University of Eldoret is one of them and it has been invaded that it
&gt; is decreasing at an alarming rate.
&gt; Let&#39;s take this into our own hands, make it our own responsibility and do
&gt; it out of passion.
&gt; LET&#39;S PROTECT OUR BIRDS&#39; HABITATS
