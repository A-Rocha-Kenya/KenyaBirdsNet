The song for Cabanis&#39; Greenbul is incorrect. The call given sounds
more like a bunting and not at all like a Cabanis&#39; Greenbul.

David Moyer


Dear David,
Thanks so much for sending in the complaint re Cabanis’s Greenbul. It
is much appreciated.
I am completely disgusted with the lack of communication from My
Digital Earth, and follow up from Bloomsbury Publications. Perhaps
these parties would themselves like to make a statement for all those
who have the App, as to when the corrections are going through, and
what has been the reason for such a delay when they were furnished
with all the details within 24 hours of receipt of the App.
It is making me look incompetent, tarnishing my reputation, and making
me appear non-caring about this whole issue. It has also taken up a
great deal of my time communicating with these parties and getting……..
absolutely nowhere. If either My Digital Earth or Bloomsbury
Publications feel unjustly slated here, I invite them to tell their
side of this sordid story.
On 18th March I received the App from My Digital Earth. Remembering
that the App went on the market in mid-December without any consent or
knowledge from all of the authors and artists.
On 19th March having worked on the App well into the night, I sent
down all the corrections that had to be incorporated. I was assured by
Otto Werdmuller of My Digital Earth, that it was all so simple and
just a matter of putting the corrections through.
Of all of the complaints that have come in with regards to wrongly
slotted calls, calls that actually crash the system etc., I found
every one and you can also see that your Cabanis’s Greenbul is there,
where Cabanis’s Bunting has been slotted in instead.
I have attached the list that I sent down to Mr Werdmuller, and copied
in to Bloomsbury Publications. I am receiving considerable flack from
people here in Kenya, as to why the corrections have not been posted
and am absolutely sick of having to fend off the attacks, and make
excuses for these other parties. It was my personal assurance to
everyone that the corrections would be finalised by My Digital Earth
within weeks, and that the corrections will be free download for
everyone who has purchased the App.
When these corrections are in, the App should have recordings of
nearly all of our 1300+ species plus geographic representation.
So attached is the list of all of the corrections that I sent in that day.
To date I have not been credited for any of the recordings, have no
contract in spite of many assurances from Bloomsbury Publications that
this was being finalised, and have received no remuneration of any
form for all the material supplied.
If everyone sends in one of the complaints to the parties concerned
each day, then maybe a wheel will grind, maybe I will get credit for
the production, maybe I will get a contract, maybe I will get
something back financially.
Very best for now
Brian
