simply dreadful, there is no end in sight to this Chinese exploitation
of planet earth, no limits at all.

if it were possible we should all stop buying Chinese goods, at least
it might produce a wake up call in their media but with no support
what so ever from our politicians and multinationals there is little
chance we can succeed.

ThanksNorman,
thanks for &#34;the heads too far up  &amp; the hearts so far down&#34;  ...
95,000 Ninety-five thousand carcasses of Gannets, stored in 20
containers, confiscated this spring in Senegal:

&gt;It is high time the no-fishing zone around Africa is expanded as was done
(too late) in Newfoundland and (just in time) around Iceland.
