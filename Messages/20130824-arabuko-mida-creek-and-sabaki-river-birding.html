  <pre>Yes this time around i had good opportunity to bird trips at the three areas. from 15th- 21st of august i managed to move around with a keen bird photographer. at arabuko we managed to photographed the five rare bird species , Clackes weaver where we had number of flocks moving in the bird party with shrikes retz&#39;s and chest-nut fronted helment shrikes. Amani sun bird on brachystegia, sokoke scops owl at cynomentra, sokoke pipit from feeding on the ground and moved to open branch of tree and east coast akalat at mixed forest. we tried to trace for spotted ground thrush but we didn&#39;t manage to find, this has been not spotted since last year. i tried to check with my fellow guides and every body says emmmmh!!!.
we as well had good photos of others coastal species at forest too. my lifer here was grey cuckoo shrike.
mida creek we had few birds with summer plumage. curlew sandpiper, bar tail godwit, whirbrel, curlew and crub plover.
Sabaki river mouth few terns flamingos,and small waders. our visit here was to search for pranticol, we later before depart we saw a crowed of them flying in and parching on the ground. at least we had around 200 - 250 Madagascar pranticol.
we had good time with our trips and weather was good for photographs.
You are welcomed to the site and have a pleasant birding trips with local guides.
