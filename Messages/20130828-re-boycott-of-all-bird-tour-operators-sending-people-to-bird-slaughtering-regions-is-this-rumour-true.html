Hi Brian,

I submitted a reply to this post earlier but for some reason it hasn&#39;t shown up on the Forum.

I&#39;m wondering if this delay is due to posts been screened by the Moderator or just heavy traffic on YahooGroups causing delays.

However, it&#39;s possible that the system is set to default replies to the Sender, rather than the Forum and I failed to notice this.  If you received my reply, please could I trouble you to post it back on the Forum?

Thanks in advance and best regards,

Nick

&gt; Dear All,
&gt; As I write millions more migrants are being slaughtered in Egypt, and
&gt; will not make it here to East Africa where without the natural
&gt; insecticide provided by these insectivores, crops will become infested
&gt; with insect pests and East Africans will go hungry.
&gt; 
&gt; It all seemed so gloomy but the latest piece of news is that Birdlife
&gt; International is going to draw up a list and name and shame all the
&gt; bird tour operators that continue advertising and leading bird tours
&gt; in Egypt, but in addition other bird slaughtering regions Cyprus,
&gt; Malta, Sardinia, Morocco, and others.
&gt; 
&gt; At present this is just a rumour, but if true it is a great move that
&gt; Birdlife will be sending this message, they must be congratulated for
&gt; taking this radical step, and we must support them in this endeavour.
&gt; They will of course be recommending a total boycott by concerned
&gt; birders for all companies continuing to operate in these countries.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone else heard about this, I really think it is a good move and
&gt; they must be congratulated for taking this approach. It will at least
&gt; make the whole issue of annual bird slaughters a world wide problem to
&gt; be rectified and not just regional as it is now. Lets hope that the
&gt; other major conservation groups all over the world follow suit.
&gt; 
&gt; Best to all
&gt; Brian
