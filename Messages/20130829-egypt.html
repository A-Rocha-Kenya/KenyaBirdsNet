  <pre>Hi, Short note on Egypt, as I was running many birdtrips there, also desert tours. So my opinion is that there is very little chance to stop this bird-massacre in any way, because its all about food and demography. The media forget to mention that Egypt is one of the most densely populated countries, and having the worst reproductional rate. They make one million childen in a year, and doesn&#39;t matter you call it Mubarak, Morsi, Sissi or democracy, nobody ever can make job for this one million extra per year. Even food. Now they are eating the european birds... I don&#39;t have doubt to say that Egypt is shrinking into a total abyss, and the one single reason is its demography, a first example of its kind. Human life in Egypt dependent on Nile, which is totally screwed up ecologically, and its a perfect example what happens if you release lots of rabbits in a fenced area. If its worsen by a political extremism and the US take off the hand from the scale, withdraw the aids, etc., the count
 ry will go back to the stone age. A good reminder for Kenya and the rest, where exactly the same could happen, very easily! Birth control! Less people is more!
Cheers, Lajos
