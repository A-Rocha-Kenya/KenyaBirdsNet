Hi Brian,

I haven&#39;t heard about this policy and would be rather surprised if it is found to be true. I heard nothing mentioned about such a boycott at last month&#39;s BirdLife World Congress in Canada and it would seem to run counter to the organisation&#39;s policies to date.

Personally, I think this move could well be ineffective and actually
counter-productive.

Isn&#39;t one of the best way to persuade people to change their own behaviour, or those of their fellow citizens, to actively engage with them and to communicate face-to-face?

I anticipate that, in Egypt at least, the number of annual BirdTours
and Birdwatchers is miniscule when compared with other interest groups such as sun-seekers, sightseers, divers, photographers, etc. etc.  If Birders stop visiting the country would anyone actually notice? Let
alone consider changing their behaviors? And besides there won&#39;t be anyone or anything to demonstrate to local people that there are
alternative ways of doing things.

I believe that a concerted campaign spearheaded by BirdLife but
utilising BirdTour Operators and their Clients would likely be far more effective.  Developing hand-outs and other literature in both Arabic and English containing carefully crafted messages about conservation and sustainable use options would be a good start. Then BirdTours and their Clients could use these leaflets to actively engage with anyone and everyone they meet in the country.

My experience in Egypt is that people are highly inquisitive when they
see a Birdwatcher in the field, and they are always amazed to look through binoculars or a scope. However, most visiting Birders (including myself) are unable to communicate effectively in the local language so opportunities for real engagement are almost always missed.

What if all BirdTour Operators committed to carrying say 500 leaflets
in their vehicles on every trip, and Clients were actively encouraged to hand them out? Surely this is likely to be far more effective at tapping into local people&#39;s interests and good sense? After all, the Bedouin tribes were actaully practicing ecological sustainability thousands of years before the concept was even recognised in the West!

Best regards,

Nick

&gt; Dear All,
&gt; As I write millions more migrants are being slaughtered in Egypt, and
&gt; will not make it here to East Africa where without the natural
&gt; insecticide provided by these insectivores, crops will become infested
&gt; with insect pests and East Africans will go hungry.
&gt; 
&gt; It all seemed so gloomy but the latest piece of news is that Birdlife
&gt; International is going to draw up a list and name and shame all the
&gt; bird tour operators that continue advertising and leading bird tours
&gt; in Egypt, but in addition other bird slaughtering regions Cyprus,
&gt; Malta, Sardinia, Morocco, and others.
&gt; 
&gt; At present this is just a rumour, but if true it is a great move that
&gt; Birdlife will be sending this message, they must be congratulated for
&gt; taking this radical step, and we must support them in this endeavour.
&gt; They will of course be recommending a total boycott by concerned
&gt; birders for all companies continuing to operate in these countries.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone else heard about this, I really think it is a good move and
&gt; they must be congratulated for taking this approach. It will at least
&gt; make the whole issue of annual bird slaughters a world wide problem to
&gt; be rectified and not just regional as it is now. Lets hope that the
&gt; other major conservation groups all over the world follow suit.
&gt; 
&gt; Best to all
&gt; Brian
