  <pre>Hi Colin,
It certainly does look like a d/p juvenile Arctic, surely can&#39;t be
this years bird yet!
My only tropical African Arctic Skua was also a dark phase imm, but
was 2000km from the sea on the Zaire River in a sorry state but perked
up with tinned sardines. I have images if you want to see it,
Best for now
Brian

PS I don&#39;t think Kenya has five Arctic records yet

&gt; Martin Mwema has just sent me the attached photo of a skua seen at sea
&gt; near Kisite Island a couple of weeks ago. It looks like an Arctic Skua
&gt; to me at first glance given the more slender bill and proportions - any
&gt; suggestions from anyone else?? It was being mobbed by terns before
&gt; landing on the water.
