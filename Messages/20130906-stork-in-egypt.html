  <pre>Just a sidenote on something which keeps my country (Hungary) excited for a while now :))
So we have a satellite tracking program for several species, eg. Red-footed Falcon, Saker, Imperial Eagle and White Storks, which is our national bird, and we love them dearly. Now we had a stork captured in Egypt by a local, because he recognised the transmitter on its back, and tought its a spy, maybe from Israel :)) It took a week to recover and release the stork with some diplomatic effort, there was even a bit of tension between Egypt and Hungary. Some days ago the stork was released, and the latest news is just arrived to my mailbox...  it was shoot and eaten yesterday a bit further south near Assuan... now we try to get back the transmitter at least... Sick...

I think somebody should smuggle out the mummies of Tut and Ramses from Egyptian Museum asap, and deposit them in British Museum, otherwise they will be eaten very soon.
