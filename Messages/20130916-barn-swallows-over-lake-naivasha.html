  <pre>Dear Birders and Spring Alive team

Nature Kenya&#39;s Sunday Birdwatch saw Barn Swallows over the KWS land on Lake
Naivasha on Sunday 15 September.

Other migrants included Common Sandpiper, Wood Sandpiper, Gull-billed Tern
and White-winged Black Tern (the last over Lake Oloidien).

Many Great Egrets were in breeding plumage (with black beaks), and a
White-fronted Bee-eater was feeding a juvenile.

Lake levels are high. Most of the causeway at KWS is under water. At Lake
Oloidien, the water is very green (full of blue-green algae?) and up to the
Acacia woodland. There were still thousands of Lesser Flamingos on 15
September.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
