  <pre>NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 16th September 2013


Dear All,
With so much of the Park inaccessible with the inconsiderate closure
of roads and access to major dams, once again the result was well down
on what was probably present.

Although the route into the Main Entrance was more convoluted than
usual because of the roadworks, the traffic flowed smoothly and Mike
Davidson, Heather Elkins, Karen Plumbe and myself were all in by
6.30am, and soon through the gate.

Apart from three Suni, KWS Mess was not worth the visit, even the
Black-collared Apalis was not calling today.  There was little at
Ivory Burning Site except for ten or so Violet-backed Starlings. At
Nagalomon Dam we also found it quiet, the Green Sandpiper was in its
usual spot on the river, and a further three were at the dam, there
were a pair of adult Darters, over fifteen Long-tailed Cormorants, two
Black-crowned Night-Herons and a couple of a few Barn Swallows seen
today.

On the back road to Hyena Dam we found nothing of note, and the dam
was not too lively and produced adult Swamphen on each side of the
dam, and each with a very large all grey chick, African Water Rails
calling, a single Great Egret, and a Wood Sandpiper. There were a few
parties of Wattled Starlings around the area. On the Hyena Dam run-off
was a male Saddle-billed Stork, and a Long-crested Eagle, whilst we
were very fortunate at the Martial Eagles nest, whilst watching the
immature on the nest to have both adults return together.

Amazing news at Karen Primary School Dam, was that we found the female
Spur-winged Goose, and every one of her seven goslings was present and
healthy, which is a commendable success.

Both young Tawny Eagles were on their nest near Mbuni Picnic Site,
waiting for their parents to return, and we had incredibly close views
of Siffling Cisticolas here, thanks to the presence of a large Puff
Adder attracting their attention.

There was a pair of Ostrich with a dozen chicks on the plains, and a
distant adult Black-chested Snake-eagle and a pallid Little grebe at
Eland Hollow. A Pectoral-patch Cisticola was coming into breeding
plumage and was quite striking.

At the murrum pits above Athi Basin, vultures were coming in to bathe,
including a pair of Lappet-faced and quite a few Ruppell’s. One of the
days three Common Sandpipers was here, the other two being at Athi
Dam.

A little further along the road we were very fortunate in finding a
White-tailed Lark feeding fairly openly on the side of the road. Hoped
for Wheatears here never materialised.

Athi Dam was not too rewarding, there was an adult White Pelican, five
Yellow-billed Storks, just two African Spoonbill, the only Crowned
Crane of the day, four pairs of Spur-winged Plover, fifteen
Kittlitz’s, three Little Stint and two Common Greenshank. One
Black-crowned Night-Heron roosted on the causeway.

Continuing towards Cheetah Gate, we found a couple of Secretarybirds,
three White-bellied Bustards, a handful of Speckle-fronted Weavers
with two attractive Grey-headed Silverbills associating with them.
Three Quailfinch were also flushed, the only birds of the day.

We were driving back just past the Rhino Circuit, towards Hippo Pools,
and there were a few birds in the acacias, so to attract the attention
of any other birds we were not seeing, I imitated a Pearl-spotted
Owlet. A few more birds came in, and we were very surprised when a
Pearl-spotted Owlet called back and was soon sitting with us. We spent
ten minutes with the owlet  (the first in the Park for three years),
and its entourage of Red-fronted Tinkerbird, Cardinal, Grey and Nubian
Woodpeckers, Common Bulbul, Spotted Morning Thrush, White-browed
Scrub-Robin, Grey Flycatcher, Rattling Cisticola, Tawny-flanked
Prinia, Yellow-breasted Apalis, Grey-backed Camaroptera, Red-faced
Crombec, Buff-bellied Warbler, Abyssinian White-eye, White-bellied and
Red-throated Tits, Paradise Flycatcher, Chin-spot Batis, Brubru,
Brown-crowned Tchagra, Sulphur-breasted Bush-Shrike, Slate-coloured
and Tropical Boubous, Black Cuckoo-shrike, Common Drongo, Black-headed
Oriole, Yellow-spotted Petronia, Lesser Masked Weaver, Red-billed
Firefinch, Red-cheeked Cordon-bleu, Purple Grenadier, Reichenow’s
Seedeater and White-bellied Canary, definitely a bias to Passerines!
When migrants are around they are aggressive owl mobbers, especially
Spotted Flycatchers, and many warbler species. No migrant came in to
this gathering and I think it was safe to say that there were none
around within hearing at least.

We took the circuit around to Kingfisher Picnic Site for the final
coffee break of the day, there were Brown Parrots calling but we could
not see them, and absent for quite a while, a pair of very attractive
Black-winged Plovers were along the road immediately before
Kingfisher. There were a few Greater Blue-eared Starlings at the site,
probably attracted by something fruiting. Our last find of the day was
the female Saddle-billed Stork below Impala Lookout. (So both the pair
are present but independent at present).

There were about fifteen Black-shouldered Kites still present, and the
total absence of Lesser Striped Swallows continued.



So in spite of KWS attempts to restrict entry and the enjoyment of our
birding we still had a good day, although nothing earth-shattering.
Mammals were in reasonable numbers, not a great deal with only single
White Rhino and Lion.

Best to all
Brian
