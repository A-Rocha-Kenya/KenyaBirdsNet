<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Central Quarry - Haller Park&nbsp; Sat 21st Sept. 
4-15 to 6-15 p.m.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Previous month we had not been able to access this 
quarry due to felling of Casuarina and other trees which fortunately have now 
been cleared.&nbsp; This had opened up a whole new vista of the lake with a 
bird's eye view of a big expanse of water.&nbsp; So many water birds we could 
hardly get to ID them fast enough for visiting birder from UK.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>At this vantage point and our usual one at lake 
level we saw 5 or 6 MPH (last one counted when flying may have been one we had 
previously seen in the reeds).&nbsp; The largest number we have seen for a very 
long time. Common Squacco fishing, about 6 Black Herons, last one doing its 
spectacular fishing display.&nbsp; Several Purple Swamphens, beautiful views as 
we were near enough to have good views but far enough not to disturb them.&nbsp; 
Purple Heron adult and juvenile. Hundreds of Cattle Egrets, an amazing sight as 
they all came in to roost.&nbsp; Many in breeding plumage. About 200 Reed 
Cormorants, many juveniles.&nbsp; African Darter nest building.&nbsp; All these 
birds seem to cram into the same tree to roost and nest, making for a very busy 
scene.&nbsp; Yellow Billed and Little Egret. Striated and Grey Heron.&nbsp; 
Brown-hooded, Malachite, Pied and Giant Kingfisher and one lone Open-billed 
Stork.&nbsp; Overhead an African Harrier Hawk, possibly the parent of the the 
juvenile still in Haller Park.&nbsp; Several Water Thick-knees although numbers 
of these seem to have declined.&nbsp; No migrant waders which might have been up 
at the far end of the lake which was inaccessible to to heavy rain.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
29 species in all. This was such a great walk.</FONT></DIV>
