  <pre>Greetings

The horror of the past weekend in Nairobi has shocked and saddened us. Birds
at least provide peaceful enjoyment. Some records:

Pied Avocet, about 4, at Athi Basin Dam in Nairobi National Park, 19
September.

Grey-rumped Swallow, just one, on the Wednesday Morning Birdwalk at Sukari
Dam on Brookside Dairies estate. There were also good numbers of waterbirds,
including Common, Green and Wood Sandpipers, Ruff and Little Stint.
Permission is needed to visit the picnic site and dam.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
