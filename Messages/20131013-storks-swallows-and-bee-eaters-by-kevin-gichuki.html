  <pre>Greetings birders and &#34;Spring Alive&#34;

The following migratory records were observed by Kevin Gichuki:

White Stork - a flock of about 50 birds flying over the wheatfields, past
Suswa town on the way to the Mara, 7 September 2013
(Fleur notes - this is a very early record!)

Barn Swallow - About 15 birds perching on a wire at Keekorok dumpsite in the
Masai Mara National Reserve, 8 September 2013

Eurasian Bee-eater - a flock of about 30 birds, flying towards southeast,
past Olepolos but before Olorgesailie Prehistoric site on the Magadi Road,
on 21 September.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
