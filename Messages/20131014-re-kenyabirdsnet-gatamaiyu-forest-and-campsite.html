There are few species that you saw in the forest that i am not sure about or&nbsp; that have not&nbsp;been recorded like Ashy Flycatcher, Black-headed Oriole and White-winged Apalis? </span></div><div><span></span>&nbsp;</div><div><span>To me, the Black-headed Oriole should be the Montane Oriole, Ashy Flycatcher could have been White-tailed Crested Flycatcher or White-eyed Slaty Flycatcher and the White-winged Apalis is Black-throated Apalis.</span></div><div><span></span>&nbsp;</div><div><span>White-winged Apalis are very rare in Kenya and the only place this species have been seen or recorded is along lower Tana
 river.</span></div><div><span></span>&nbsp;</div><div><span>Shailesh</span></div><div><br></div>  <div style="font-family: times new roman, new york, times, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> <div style="font-family: times new roman, new york, times, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> <div dir="ltr"> <font size="2" face="Arial"> <div style="margin: 5px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); height: 0px; line-height: 0; font-size: 0px;" class="hr" contentEditable="false" readonly="true"></div>  <b><span style="font-weight: bold;">From:</span></b> "tabithawafula88@gmail.com" &lt;tabithawafula88@gmail.com&gt;<br> <b><span style="font-weight: bold;">To:</span></b> kenyabirdsnet@yahoogroups.com <br> <b><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sent:</span></b> Monday, 14 January 2013, 13:28<br> <b><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subject:</span></b> [KENYABIRDSNET] GATAMAIYU FOREST AND CAMPSITE<br> </font> </div> <wbr><div id="yiv820583993">

      <div>This weekend, a group of  photographers and I visited the Gatamaiyu forest. Our main aim was to  photograph the Bar-tailed trogon.<br>
 We thought it would take us more time looking for the bird but the trogons were right there, so  buisy singing.<br>
Unfortunately all the cameras went down due to low power.<br>
This gave us good chance to look for other birds<br>
1.berded woodpecker 2.cabanis greenbul 3yellow whiskered greenbul 4.montane white eye5.nothern double colored sun bird6.ashy fly catcher7.brown capped weaver.8black headed oriole 9. Hartlaub's turaco and many others.<br>
<br>
Do we find white-winged apalis in Gatamaiyu? I had one, whose throat was soo white but am not sure which one it was since I had no photo.<br>
<br>
Enjoy birdind! <br>
Tabitha<br>
