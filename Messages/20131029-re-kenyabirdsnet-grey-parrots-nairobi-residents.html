  <pre>Dear Tabitha,
Any Grey Parrots around Nairobi have derived from escapes. Somebirds
have persisted for many years,
Best for now

&gt; I heve seen two grey parrots at a home in Lavington. Is Nairobi their
&gt; habitat or they might have escaped from somewhere?
&gt; They are so lovely despite their noice.
&gt;
&gt; Good birding,
&gt; Tabitha
