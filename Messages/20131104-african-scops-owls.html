  <pre>Dear All,
More requests on African Scops Owls. It is possible that in Kenya it
is not so simple as just African Scops Owls. This species is currently
under some scrutiny, but what is needed are recordings from all parts
of Kenya. When you hear an African Scops could you please record the
bird, and send it to me with details of location, date, time etc., and
any other information you wish to provide.
Orr River could be up at Mt. Nyiru, does this sound right to anyone,
Best for now
Brian
