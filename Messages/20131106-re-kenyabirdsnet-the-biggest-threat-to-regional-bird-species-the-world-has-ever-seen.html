&gt; Would be grateful if anyone can check if my name is on the petition.
&gt;
&gt; I made several attempts but had great difficulty opening the page and cannot
&gt; be sure my signature eventually was accepted.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   Dear All on Kenyabirdsnet,
&gt;
&gt;   The petition to stop the slaughter of our migrant birds is doing well
&gt;   and in its third day. We decided to monitor the first 500 signatories,
&gt;   not to see who they are, but to get some idea of the geography of
&gt;   support. In the last day we have written to all of the major and
&gt;   regional Bird Tour companies, requesting that they advise all of their
&gt;   clients of the existence of this movement to show Egypt that there are
&gt;   more people against what they are doing than they seem to think (or
&gt;   even care about).
&gt;
&gt;   I am sure that you will be interested in the results in this first
&gt;   wave of support.
&gt;
&gt;   Kenya you have shown the true spirit that Kenyans are renowned for, in
&gt;   greatly supporting this movement you show you really care. Thank you,
&gt;   and thank you in advance for what you are going to do to spread the
&gt;   word further.
&gt;
&gt;   Other great regional support comes from Israel, thanks to all those
&gt;   who have shown your condemnation of the heinous act, and again advance
&gt;   thanks for taking it further.
&gt;
&gt;   Considerable support has come from South Africa, and all this is so
&gt;   much appreciated to encourage change in favour of the birds.
&gt;
&gt;   Apart from the regions that you would expect to support the petition,
&gt;   surprises have been an unprecedented backing from the Philippines,
&gt;   scattered votes throughout eastern Europe, encouragement from other
&gt;   bird-slaughtering nations Cypress, Malta, the Middle East and Egypt
&gt;   itself.
&gt;
&gt;   We can recommend the July 2013 issue of National Geographic, possibly
&gt;   the finest edition that they have circulated. Very interesting
&gt;   articles covering the Solar System, the last known individual of a
&gt;   once numerous frog, a riveting look at geneology and evolution, and
&gt;   the most gripping of all… “The Last Song,” giving horrifying graphic
&gt;   detail of what is taking place to progressively exterminate our
&gt;   migrant birds.
&gt;
&gt;   Jonathan Franzen and David Guttenfelder are the unsung heroes of the
&gt;   day. The Franzen style of explicitness is very hard hitting, whilst
&gt;   reading it shivers were travelling down the spine, thinking that “you
&gt;   know, the next generation may never know what pleasures a fall of
&gt;   Eurasian migrants can bring, or hear the cheerful chirrups as flocks
&gt;   of Bee-eaters announce that they are back, or see parties of fluting,
&gt;   gaudy Golden Orioles collect in fruiting fig-trees.”
&gt;
&gt;   David Guttenfelder is a conflict photographer. That means that he
&gt;   spends his life spanning the globe travelling from human misery to
&gt;   even more human misery. Whilst he is enormously moved by what he sees,
&gt;   he states that nothing has affected him as much as seeing what is
&gt;   happening to the Eurasian migrants, and…. He is not a birder.
&gt;
&gt;   We have attached the extremely moving text from the National
&gt;   Geographic issue, as little can compare with Franzen’s ability to get
&gt;   the message across, move you to a state of despair and yet also give
&gt;   some insight as to the people that are doing this, those to survive,
&gt;   those to make huge profits commercially and those that are callous and
&gt;   wealthy and kill the small birds just for the sheer pleasure of doing
&gt;   it.
&gt;
&gt;   Let’s get more people to show this disapproval, condemnation and share
&gt;   the disgust against what these people are doing to the future of
&gt;   Africa.
&gt;
&gt;   Thinking of means of spreading the word, here are a few ideas how you
&gt;   can assist with further support;
&gt;   placing this article on your Facebook and Twitter accounts will
&gt;   exponentially assist in spreading the word further, and showing a
&gt;   stronger solidarity towards ending the current and impending horrors.
&gt;
&gt;   And, if you can add details of this petition to your blog, website,
&gt;   any social media platform that you use, that would be really great!
&gt;   Further still, if you like to post images on web forums, such as
&gt;   birdforum, surfbirds, birdguides (among many others), then please also
&gt;   provide the link to this petition. These migrant birds need all the
&gt;   support that we can muster for them. Let&#39;s get this message out to the
&gt;   world ASAP and hope that they have a chance!
&gt;
&gt;   You know who we are, the Golden O support team!
&gt;
&gt;   Once again the site for voting, and advising all your friends to vote…
