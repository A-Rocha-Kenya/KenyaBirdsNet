    Hi<br>
    <br>
    I wrote my suggestion on how to approach this situation based on
    over 20 years experience working for conservation NGOs, and for the
    past 3 years at a university, on a number of wildlife-human conflict
    situations. My passion and integrity are still intact, however
    somewhat battered and bruised as not all conservation battles I have
    contributed to were won (not for lack of effort) as economics trumps
    ecology. Fortunately not all battles were lost, so these wins
    provide me with the energy to continue. My attitude in the piece I
    wrote is based on my approach to these conflict situations having
    been tempered by having learned the hard way that working with
    people certainly takes longer but ultimately achieves far more than
    work against them. <br>
    <br>
    Adam I do not presume to know you, it is unfortunate that you have
    assumed to know me based on this short piece I wrote.<br>
    <br>

          they are beyond foolish and the words that I would use to
          describe these ‘people’ are
          not suitable for a polite forum such as this. It seems to me
          that the world is increasingly
          full of foolish people and the unfortunate rise of political
          correctness, where
          a good and honest man such as yourself cannot speak his mind
          on a subject that
          he is passionate about, saddens me greatly.</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">Dr Evans has his own opinion about bird
          hunting and he is
          perfectly entitled to it. Personally, I agree with very little
          that he has
          written but I am sure that he too will say that am entitled to
          my own opinion. For
          one, I am happy to be ‘confrontational’ and use terms such as
          ‘criminal’ where
          I see fit. Regardless of the national laws in which these
          hunters operate, the
          behaviour of these people is ethical criminal to you and me,
          and we have every

          very happy with his
          lot and I genuinely wish him every success - it sounds like a
          great life. His opinion is a professional one and, in this age
          of political correctness, I fully understand why he feels the
          need
          to pussyfoot around such gritty subject matter. For the rest
          of us, who do not
          use the word ‘stakeholder’ everyday, have an opinion based on

          and mostly mindless
          hunting of birds in the Mediterranean has been high among
          birders, naturalists and
          conservationists for well over 30 years now, and the
          professional conservation
          ecologists of this world have had little success in tackling
          it, in fact it
          is considerably worse now than ever. Maybe it is time for a

                                I am not apposed to hunting so long as
                                it is undertaken ethically and in the
                                context of sustainable utilization. I am
                                however not a hunter myself, unless you
                                equate my lists of birds seen in Africa,
                                list of all species I have ringed and
                                list of species photographed as trophies
                                of another kind of &quot;hunting&quot;. Keep in
                                mind that hunting is as old as humanity,
                                and probably as old as life has existed
                                on Earth. <br>
                                <br>
                                In the world there are clearly opinions
                                ranging from anti-hunting to the other
                                extreme of hunting with no limits, and
                                everything in between. With the world
                                divided into different countries with
                                different laws it is doubtful that
                                consensus is possible on a solution
                                regarding hunting (or other issues) 
                                that will satisfy everyone completely.
                                As examples: A complete global ban on
                                hunting will not be accepted by the
                                hunters. At the other extreme, hunting
                                without limits (no legislation, permits,
                                seasons etc.) will not be accepted by
                                the conservationists (and by many
                                hunters). The solution is somewhere
                                between these two extremes.<br>
                                <br>
                                Not all countries have the same laws,
                                for example Kenyan law does not allow
                                hunting were as South African law does.
                                Although I do not know Lebanese law it
                                appears to me that the Lebanese Hunting
                                Club and similar clubs in for example
                                Italy are legal within their respective
                                countries. Labeling people as criminals
                                (or fools or any other derogatory
                                epithet) and their activities as
                                criminal, when this is untrue in the
                                context of their countries&#39; legislation,
                                is confrontational and I expect these
                                people and clubs will respond in a
                                confrontational manner and no benefit
                                will come of such an approach for any of
                                the people involved or for the birds we
                                want conserved.<br>
                                <br>
                                Keep in mind that these hunters are
                                people, with families, that are not that
                                different from us, they just happen to
                                engage in an activity that causes
                                concern for us about the future
                                existence of the birds they hunt. A
                                solution to this situation will not be
                                gained by confrontation. A solution to
                                this issue of ensuring the future
                                existence (conservation of these birds)
                                will be achieved by a compromise that
                                nether party (anti-hunter or hunters
                                without limits) will be completely
                                satisfied with. However the aim should
                                remain the conservation of these birds
                                by all stakeholders, not who is or is
                                not completely satisfied with the
                                compromises made to achieve this i.e. us
                                conservationists may need to accept some
                                amount of hunting (even although some of
                                us disapprove), and the hunters will
                                need to respect some no hunting areas,
                                hunting seasons, quotas etc. <br>
                                <br>
                                The aim should remain the conservation
