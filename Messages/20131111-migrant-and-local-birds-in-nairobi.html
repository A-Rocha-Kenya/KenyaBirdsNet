  <div dir="ltr"><div><div><div><div>Hi All,<br><br></div>The autumn passage of migrants seems slow although it does feel as though numbers of some species are picking up ever so slightly here in Karen, Nairobi.<br><br></div>
Eurasian Bee-eaters are still pouring through with several flocks of 15-30 seen and heard on most days - they&#39;ve been seen in excellent numbers here this year. Smaller numbers of Willow Warblers are seen most days with a day maximum of 6 so far, but no other migrant warblers here as yet. Green Sandpipers have been calling as they fly over early in the mornings, with two today.<br>
<br></div>The local species which are becoming increasingly vocal and active, maybe a result of the recent rains. Eastern Honeybirds and Black Cuckoo-shrikes are especially obvious, and both Little Rush and Dark-capped Yellow Warbler are in full song in the wet valley below us. Best of all though have been the local raptors; a Crowned Eagle has been seen and heard frequently, both in and from the garden, and yesterday the mobbing crows alerted us to a cracking Ayre&#39;s Hawk Eagle that landed just above us with a prey item. It stayed around for 15 minues before tiring of the crows but I managed to get a few shots before it left us (see attached).<br>
<br></div>What&#39;s the general feeling out there on the migration so far?<br><br><div><div><div><div>Best for now<br>Adam<br></div></div></div></div></div>
