  <pre>Hi Adam,
Out in the field although I will send in proper details of migrant
status when this tour over. Wheatears are in really good numbers in
Samburu area, I suspect that most of these actually come from further
east than Egypt and avoid the slaughter. Warblers by contrast are
pitiful, Willow Warblers just not going through, just three
Olivaceous, one Marsh, one Barred. Small numbers of Sprossers, three
Rock Thrush, one Irania. Migrant raptors equally pitiful apart from
Steppe Eagles. Anyway I will send details of these to the net later,
and for elsewhere.
A couple of people have been studying the geography of the petitions
signed to stop the Egyptian massacre of East African migrants, I don&#39;t
know why they have been but they said that they were very heartened by
the worldwide support so far with virtually every country on the
planet being represented. Strangely they both pointed out that
Tanzania is just not represented, as if they just don&#39;t give a damn
about the slaughter to ours and their migrants. Just 4 votes out of
1300 certainly gives exactly this impression. Do you think we should
tell Neil that his country is getting a bad rep for showing
indifference? Are you sure that you sent the site details to him?
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; The autumn passage of migrants seems slow although it does feel as though
&gt; numbers of some species are picking up ever so slightly here in Karen,
&gt; Nairobi.
&gt;
&gt; Eurasian Bee-eaters are still pouring through with several flocks of 15-30
&gt; seen and heard on most days - they&#39;ve been seen in excellent numbers here
&gt; this year. Smaller numbers of Willow Warblers are seen most days with a day
&gt; maximum of 6 so far, but no other migrant warblers here as yet. Green
&gt; Sandpipers have been calling as they fly over early in the mornings, with
&gt; two today.
&gt;
&gt; The local species which are becoming increasingly vocal and active, maybe a
&gt; result of the recent rains. Eastern Honeybirds and Black Cuckoo-shrikes are
&gt; especially obvious, and both Little Rush and Dark-capped Yellow Warbler are
&gt; in full song in the wet valley below us. Best of all though have been the
&gt; local raptors; a Crowned Eagle has been seen and heard frequently, both in
&gt; and from the garden, and yesterday the mobbing crows alerted us to a
&gt; cracking Ayre&#39;s Hawk Eagle that landed just above us with a prey item. It
&gt; stayed around for 15 minues before tiring of the crows but I managed to get
&gt; a few shots before it left us (see attached).
&gt;
&gt; What&#39;s the general feeling out there on the migration so far?
&gt;
&gt; Best for now
&gt; Adam
