  Dear All<p></p><div><br></div><div>Over the past 10 years we have noticed a real decline in numbers of certain sunbird species in our garden in Karen. At our feeder 10 years ago we would have had a constant stream of visitors with amethyst, collared and variable being the most numerous, and scarlet chested, bronze, green headed, and northern double collared less numerous, but always present. Now (despite a local boom of nesting variables in our garden) we only have a few amethyst and very rarely a bronze or scarlet chested and I haven&#39;t seen the green headed for a year or so.</div><div><br></div><div>We changed to using glucose instead of sugar a few years ago but this didn&#39;t seem to have an obvious effect on the number of visitors. Our garden and surrounding gardens have remained the same so the habitat shouldn&#39;t have had an impact... Has anyone else noticed this or is it just a local, natural, fluctuation in population numbers?</div><div><br></div><div>Kieran</div>
