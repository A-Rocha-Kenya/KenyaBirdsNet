<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Bird walk at Vipingo Ridge Golf Course Sat 
16/11:</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Managed at last to see my first Oriole of the 
season but only saw about 3&nbsp;whereas in past years they have been 
numerous.&nbsp; Lots of Barn Swallows dipping into one of the now well 
established lakes together with dozens of the most fabulous Carmine 
Bee-eaters.&nbsp;Other migrants were&nbsp;a couple of Common Sandpipers&nbsp;and 
lots of Yellow Wagtails which love the short grass on the fairways.&nbsp; There 
were a big number of Black-headed herons and it looks as though this&nbsp;may 
develop into a heronry, something to look forward to.&nbsp; A pair of Red-rumped 
Swallows were an unusual sighting for us in a large number of Striped 
Swallows&nbsp;which obligingly posed for our two photographers just a few feet 
away on a low bridge.&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of White-faced Whistling Ducks sitting 
with a Little Grebe gave Doris another good photo opportunity.&nbsp; There were 
big flocks of Red-billed Quelea.&nbsp; The great Sparrow Hawk nest had been 
rebuilt but there was no sign of activity.&nbsp; 32 species in total in&nbsp;two 
and half hours.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The crows are now far less than they were before 
although Duncan who was thinking he had destroyed most of them with his rigorous 
trapping was disappointed to have caught 90 in the last week but his hard work 
seems to be paying off if slowly&nbsp; If only we had Starlicide!&nbsp;&nbsp;
