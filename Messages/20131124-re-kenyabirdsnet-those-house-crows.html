  <pre>Amazing discussion. Every resource is gauged by its contribution to
nature. The most valuable resource is one that occurs where it is
naturally original. Nature has the ability to control what it bears
when it is where mother nature gave birth to it. There would be
conditions in Asia to control House Crow populations but being an
alien species in east africa, nature seems to be lacking mechanism to
bring down population size. In other words....MAN IS PAYING BACK TO
NATURE CONSEQUENCES OF HAVING INTRODUCED THE SPECIES IN A HABITAT THAT
WAS NOT ORIGINALLY ITS. Truth be told, House Crows have more negative
consequences to nature in east africa than their original homeland.

&gt;&gt; As bad as it might sound I don&#39;t support &#39;killing crow&#39; initiatives. When
&gt;&gt; will man learn to respect nature &amp; let it propagate itself in its own way.
&gt;&gt; Let nature take course!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi all
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Someone MUST talk to someone in Authority in government.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; We have taken our abt 1.2 million house crows in Tanzania using DRC1339
&gt;&gt;&gt; and traps.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Traps work ... crows DO NOT learn, we kill them before they can !!
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; One must kill them in the dark after birds outside have gone to roost.
&gt;&gt;&gt; leaving 2 birds in the trap to attract others the following day.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Our President has 10 working traps in State House. They have taken out
&gt;&gt;&gt; more than 100,000 crows in the past 4 years.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Fresh food and clean water every day is all it takes........ and a
&gt;&gt;&gt; certain amount of common sense !!!
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; stop talking abt it in Kenya and DO IT.
