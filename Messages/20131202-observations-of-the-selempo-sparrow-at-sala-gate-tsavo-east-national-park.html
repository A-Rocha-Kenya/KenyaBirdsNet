  <pre>Dear Olivier,
I hope this finds you well, and that you had a good Easter.
I also hope you have been reading the interesting issue of nominate
Somali Sparrow at Sala Gate in Tsavo East.
Titus Imboma now writes to say that he has seen the same birds in
Garsen. Can we trouble you next time you are in Garsen to pay
attention to the House Sparrows present and report on your findings.
It is possible that the bird is undergoing a southwards extension in
range, and maybe elsewhere still undetected.
Thankyou for this and best for now
Brian

PS if the images of the bird did not come out attached to the birdsnet
article, let me know and I will send some across.
