      <p>Dear All,<br>
Don Turner and myself are trying to understand the distribution of<br>
Black Cuckoo in Kenya. It is an enigmatic bird, so commonly heard in<br>
the rains, males holding territories, having combatting calling<br>
sessions with other males, and engaged in display chases of females.<br>
In the rains calling for much of the day but has anyone ever seen a<br>
young bird or one with a foster parent (which should be Boubous and<br>
relatives).<br>
<br>
The distribution of nominate black birds and red-chested birds is also<br>
causing some confusion. It would be good to receive records of Black<br>
Cuckoos from around the country, but with special reference to whether<br>
they are the nominate all black birds or the jacksoni type with red<br>
chests and heavy barring below. Records of black nominate  in and west<br>
of the Rift and Red-chested barred below, in and east of the Rift,<br>
plus dates please.<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone for co-operating in this piece of research,<br>
Brian<br>
