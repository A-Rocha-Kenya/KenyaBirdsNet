  <pre>Hi Martin,
That&#39;s really good. Once you are back could you also do a write up on
the Little Terns for the East African Rarities Committee and send it
to Nigel Hunter at &lt;nigelhunter@timbale.org&gt;
Thanks for this and lookingforward to reading further of what you
found up there.
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Thanks Brian. I have been keeping a look out for saunders&#39;s terns as well
&gt; but none so far. The problem is that most of the birds are in non-breeding
&gt; plumage. Luckily with the groups I have seen there have been some birds in
&gt; breeding plumage.
&gt;
&gt; The other exciting find is a roost of about 1,000 african skimmers. So far
&gt; they have been using the site fairly consistently in varying numbers. Other
&gt; than that I have been seeing small numbers of species that you would
&gt; normally find at the coast such as Terek Sandpiper (1), Whimbrel (2) and
&gt; Eurasian Curlew (3)...I also counted over 3,000 Great White Pelicans at
&gt; Ferguson&#39;s Gulf. I&#39;ll send a list around once I am done.
&gt; Best,
&gt; Martin

&gt; Dear Martin,
&gt; This record is very exciting, and goes a long way to helping to
&gt; understand the presence of Little Tern in East Africa. Your birds
&gt; apart from the White-winged Black are all Little, and if you had
&gt; eighty like this then that is a great record.
&gt; Sweeping comments like.... Saunders Tern also occurs on Lake Turkana
&gt; have clouded past records. We now know that Little Terns are the bird
&gt; of the lakes, and Saunders is primarily coastal. I had one bird in
&gt; breeding plumage at Loyengelani two years ago at this time at dusk. I
&gt; have never been convinced that I have seen a Rift Valley Saunders, but
&gt; Little on Turkana, Baringo, Naivasha and Nakuru. Records are
&gt; increasing in Tanzania as well with small flocks wintering at Speke&#39;s
&gt; Bay on Lake Victoria. That said, whilst Saunder&#39;s inland may be
&gt; suspect, Littles do also move along the coast, but they are probably
&gt; overlooked for the best part.
&gt; What else did you have at Turkana this is a very special time of year
&gt; there, and you should have had some other exciting finds,
&gt; Best for now
&gt; Brian

&gt;&gt; Hello Birders,
&gt;&gt; I have attached photos of  what I believe to be a Little Tern
&gt;&gt; photographed
&gt;&gt; at Lake Turkana. There was a flock of about 80 of these birds. As can be
&gt;&gt; seen from the photo, the white of the forehead extends to the rear of the
&gt;&gt; eye giving a V-like profile unlike the Saunders&#39;s tern.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; According to the guidebook I&#39;m using (Zimmerman), there only 4 records so
&gt;&gt; far from the coast and Naivasha. Does anyone have information as to
&gt;&gt; whether
&gt;&gt; there have been further sightings and from where they have been
&gt;&gt;  made?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Best,
&gt;&gt; Martin
