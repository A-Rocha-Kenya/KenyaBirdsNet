<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Sat. walk in shale quarry at Nguu Tatu mostly at 
the small wetland.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>For the first time we saw a small flock of migrant 
waders, Greenshank with a couple of Common Sand pipers&nbsp;and </FONT><FONT 
face=Arial size=2>a large&nbsp;number of very varied Yellow Wagtails but nothing 
else from the migrant world.&nbsp; No Barn Swallows as yet.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Local birds were plentiful giving us a list of 37 
species including Spurwing Plovers,&nbsp;group&nbsp;of 14 Open-billed Storks, 
one splendid male Namaqua Dove, Scarlet Chested Sunbird which we hardly see 
these days, White Faced Whistling Ducks, Yellow-billed Stork, Black Crake and 
Black-headed Heron were some of the other water birds.&nbsp; We'd hoped to see 
the Pelicans but they seem to have moved on.&nbsp; A juvenile African Harrier 
Hawk was the only bird of prey on the list.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Previous week I was at Vipingo beach where I only 
saw a couple of Greenshanks, a pair of Common Sandpipers, one or two Whimbrels 
and a few scattered Grey Plovers plus a single Ringed Plover.&nbsp; This beach 
used to be covered in waders.&nbsp; The food chain may have something to do with 
it as there are literally dozens of people all collecting small things off the 
reef, all walking away with a half-filled bag.&nbsp; This is just on the outside 
of the Kurawitu restricted area where I am told that the controlled fishing has 
led to resurgence of fish stocks.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>In Tudor I have not yet seen or heard any Eurasian 
Golden Orioles but did have a sub-adult Osprey whizzing past my verandah twice 
last week.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>I heard from Vipingo Ridge that there are lots of 
migrants up there so our Nov. bird walk will be there. We live in 
hope!</FONT></DIV>
