  <pre>Dear All,
This just in from Rupert Watson:

Two good sightings in the course of half a day in Nbi park yesterday 10th Dec.

1	Blue-cheeked bee-eater just down stream of Hippo Pools - lovely bird
on top of a dead tree.

2	Three sodden KWS rangers, plus a vehicle, driving a large herd of
Masai cattle up near K P S dam, on the way towards E gate.

I think that this is only about the third Blue-cheeked Bee-eater
record in NNP where they inexplicably rare,

Best for now
Brian
