  <pre>Dear All,
I sincerely hope that everyone on kenyabirdsnet has not been
complacent and taken what little trouble it is to sign the petition to
stop the Cypriots slaughtering and eating our migrants.

I have attached a gentle persuader!

Thanks to you all
Brian

PS The pitiful numbers of migrants we had this year are a reality.
