  <pre>Dear All,
You really must read this really interesting short paper, on how trees
communicate with birds to come to their aid when infested with insect
pests.

After you have read it, think how with the Egyptians last year
slaughtering 140,000,000 insectivorous migrants on their way to East
Africa, how many trees did not get an answer to their shout for help,
particularly in the arid zone.

The site is below,
Best for now
Brian
