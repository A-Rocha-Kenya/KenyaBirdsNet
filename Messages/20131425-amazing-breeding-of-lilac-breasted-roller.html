  <hr/>
  <pre>As i pack the car at the Kenya commercial bank Garsen car park, amazing flying of the roller coming down from the room of the bank and landed on the stamp of a dead tree close to the fence carrying insect and slowly went in the hole feeding young ones. surely at this place i did not expect any breeding of the so bird where the road is busy with Tuktuk, motor bike, vehicles, pedestrians and bank customers coming in and out.
The question is, do people see this bird? or is it due to security for the bank where people are not allowed to hang around the compound.
i hope the bird is relating it self with People.
