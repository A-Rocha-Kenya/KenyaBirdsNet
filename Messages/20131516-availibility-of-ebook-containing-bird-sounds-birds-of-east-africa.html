  <pre>Dear All,
I promised to update on the East African Bird App.
We are making very good progress, and the App came through safely via
Safaricom and I now have it.
I am truly amazed, as I have never seen such technology before. The
production is remarkable and I highly endorse it. The calls that I
have played so far are clear and a great learning tool for the East
African avifauna. I confess I am still in the Aâ€™s! But then there are
1300 species in EA so it will take a little while.  When I have done
this I will send amendments and corrections to My Digital Earth who
will implement them straight away.  I honestly never thought it would
be as impressive as it is.
For those that do have it, could you please send me any comments and
if you notice any errors of omissions. Please send it direct, as I
don&#39;t want to clog up the nets, but if you want to broadcast to all
feel free either positively or negatively. On receipt of your comments
I will endeavour to get things updated at the earliest.
Best to all
Brian
