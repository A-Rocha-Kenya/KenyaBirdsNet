  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" ><tr><td valign="top" style="font: inherit;">Hi Rupert,<br><br>Very interesting record. I have experienced such sighting at Ngulia Safari Lodge in Tsavo West National Park during ringing session of palaearctic migrants, where I released a Common white throat warbler( Silvia communis) after it was ringed and when it patched on a tree nearby the ringing station and was quickly captured by a Grey Hornbill. It fed on the warbler till it was no more. It is true such records will be of great importance in realizing the change in the niche if the species.<br><br>Thanks and wish you wonderful birding year.<br><br>Titus Imboma <br><br>--- On <b>Mon, 1/21/13, Rupert Watson <i>&lt;rupertwatson48@gmail.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:<br><blockquote style="border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); margin-left: 5px; padding-left: 5px;"><br>From: Rupert Watson &lt;rupertwatson48@gmail.com&gt;<br>Subject: [KENYABIRDSNET] Strange

      <p>I meant to write up this report immediately after our return from Tsavo East on New Year's Eve, but better late than never, so here goes.</p><div><br></div><div>One mid-morning we were round behind the dam wall of Aruba dam, close to where the road crosses the outlet stream, when we noticed an African grey hornbill quite far away on top of a dead or otherwise leafless tree, with a yellow bird in its beak.</div><div><br></div><div>The prey bird was a very lemon yellow, and given the huge number of golden pipits in the Park it was probably one of these.</div><div><br></div><div>Anyway, for several minutes, we watched the hornbill beat the bird's carcass against the branch on which it was perched, with extraordinary ferocity. &nbsp;Then it flew off with the victim in its beak, out of sight.</div><div><br></div><div>I have no idea how or where it caught the pipit, if that is what it was, or whether it would have eaten, and the whole incident posed
 so many questions. &nbsp;Research into grey hornbill behaviour has done nothing to answer any of them.</div><div><br></div><div>Comments welcome,&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Salaams, Rupert Watson</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;<br><div>
