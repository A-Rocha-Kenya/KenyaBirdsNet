  <pre>Just for your information, there is an ongoing initiative that also involves Lebanon and 10 other countries, part of which is addressing the problem of hunting (in this case of the Migratory Soaring Birds) through engagement of the stakeholders in the hunting sector. See the following website and possibly get into the &#39;national&#39; component section to see the Lebanon bit . http://migratorysoaringbirds.undp.birdlife.org/

     Hi All,
 
     
 
     I am not apposed to hunting so long as it is undertaken
 ethically
     and in the context of sustainable utilization. I am
 however not a
     hunter myself, unless you equate my lists of birds seen
 in Africa,
     list of all species I have ringed and list of species
 photographed
     as trophies of another kind of &#34;hunting&#34;. Keep
 in mind that hunting
     is as old as humanity, and probably as old as life has
 existed on
     Earth. 
 
     
 
     In the world there are clearly opinions ranging from
 anti-hunting to
     the other extreme of hunting with no limits, and
 everything in
     between. With the world divided into different countries
 with
     different laws it is doubtful that consensus is possible
 on a
     solution regarding hunting (or other issues)  that will
 satisfy
     everyone completely. As examples: A complete global ban
 on hunting
     will not be accepted by the hunters. At the other
 extreme, hunting
     without limits (no legislation, permits, seasons etc.)
 will not be
     accepted by the conservationists (and by many hunters).
 The solution
     is somewhere between these two extremes.
 
     
 
     Not all countries have the same laws, for example Kenyan
 law does
     not allow hunting were as South African law does.
 Although I do not
     know Lebanese law it appears to me that the Lebanese
 Hunting Club
     and similar clubs in for example Italy are legal within
 their
     respective countries. Labeling people as criminals (or
 fools or any
     other derogatory epithet) and their activities as
 criminal, when
     this is untrue in the context of their countries&#39;
 legislation, is
     confrontational and I expect these people and clubs will
 respond in
     a confrontational manner and no benefit will come of
 such an
     approach for any of the people involved or for the birds
 we want
     conserved.
 
     
 
     Keep in mind that these hunters are people, with
 families, that are
     not that different from us, they just happen to engage
 in an
     activity that causes concern for us about the future
 existence of
     the birds they hunt. A solution to this situation will
 not be gained
     by confrontation. A solution to this issue of ensuring
 the future
     existence (conservation of these birds) will be achieved
 by a
     compromise that nether party (anti-hunter or hunters
 without limits)
     will be completely satisfied with. However the aim
 should remain the
     conservation of these birds by all stakeholders, not who
 is or is
     not completely satisfied with the compromises made to
 achieve this
     i.e. us conservationists may need to accept some amount
 of hunting
     (even although some of us disapprove), and the hunters
 will need to
     respect some no hunting areas, hunting seasons, quotas
 etc. 
 
     
 
     The aim should remain the conservation of these birds by
 all
     stakeholders.
 
     
 
     Kind regards

       Hi all, 
       We should re-post this on Facebook and
 express
           our indignation and horror at these criminals and
 their
           government which allows these criminal activities.
 I am
           posting this on my Facebook page right now.

           Here are some more fools killing
 our migrants
             and actually bragging about it quite loudly. On
 facebook
             they have over 11000 &#39;likes&#39;.
