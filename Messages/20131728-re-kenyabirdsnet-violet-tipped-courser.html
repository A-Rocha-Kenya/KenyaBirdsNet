  <pre>Hi Willy,
No there are no previous records from NNP, historically a nest was
found on Stony Athi.
This is such a very rare bird in Kenya, but when they should turn up
as southern visitors. Is it still there and can you just give a brief
outline how it differed from a Crowned Plover.
Very best for now
Brian

&gt; Dear All -
&gt;
&gt; The day before yesterday in the evening, whilst walking in the Silole
&gt; Sanctuary (southern border of Nbi Nat Park), I saw a single plover-like
&gt; bird with very distinctive markings &amp; pink legs which Zimmerman et al tells
&gt; me is a Violet-Tipped Courser....a first sighting for me.
&gt;
&gt; Presumably it is unusual to see this sp. in NNP though the book tells me
&gt; there are previous records?
&gt;
&gt; Best, Will Knocker
