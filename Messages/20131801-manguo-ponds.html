<BR>
The holiday was a good opportunity for Nature Kenya's Wednesday morning birdwalk to drive up to Manguo Pond in Limuru. The water was expansive, and although migrants had left, there were many birds.<BR>
<BR>
Highlights included:<BR>
Maccoa Duck (at least one male)<BR>
About 60 White-backed Ducks, including small ducklings<BR>
Fulvous Whistling Ducks allowing close approach<BR>
More than 12 Purple Swamphen, with brown juveniles and larger immatures<BR>
Red-knobbed Coots nesting (and large juveniles)<BR>
African Jacana with young<BR>
Whiskered Terns apparently nesting<BR>
<BR>
Wishing you good birding, Fleur</SPAN></FONT>
