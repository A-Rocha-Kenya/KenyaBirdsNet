  <div dir="ltr"><div>Dear Birders,</div><div> </div><div>I have been fortunate enough to have visited the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in eastern end of Laikipia County, Kenya. This was in late April-early May, mid June and now in mid July. In all the three visits, I have made observations of breeding records of various birds including an immature of Saddle-billed Stork (see attached image) at the marshes (close to Elephants bridge), and was there today 15th July 2013.</div>
<div> </div><div>In June, there was an immature of African Fish Eagle. Today, I had a flock of Helmeted Guineafowl with a couple of young ones. Both Black-winged and Black-crowned Plovers too had several nests with mostly 2 eggs in May</div>
<div> </div><div>It&#39;s lovely bird watching here amidst Elephants, Rhinoceros, Lions... name it, and I might share sightings and spots in <em>Kenya Birding</em> when I find time to write it up.</div><div> </div><div>Wamiti. <br>
