  Greetings Kenyan Birders,<p></p><div><br></div><div>For those interested in the above issue, I urge you to follow this link to a BirdLife International report of a recent meeting held in Bonn, and hosted by colleagues at the AEWA Secretariat.</div><div><br></div><div>http://www.birdlife.org/africa/news/concern-over-migrant-birds-prompts-international-response<br></div><div><br></div><div>Included in the report is a video interview with Noor Noor, Executive Coordinator of Nature Conservation Egypt. &nbsp;Please do take time to listen to what Noor, and others have to say on the subject.</div><div><br></div><div>It will be a complex and challenging task to address this problem, especially given the other pressures facing the two Governments at the current time. &nbsp;However, the meeting set the scene for important and ongoing international cooperation and support, which I believe provides real hope that a effective and long-term solutions can be found.</div><div><br></div><div>NPW</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>
