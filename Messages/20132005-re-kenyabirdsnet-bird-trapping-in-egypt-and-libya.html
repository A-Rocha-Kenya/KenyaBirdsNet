  <div dir="ltr"><div><div><div><div><div><div><div>Hi Nick,<br><br></div>Thanks very much for posting this important announcement and keeping the kenyabirdnet &#39;in the loop&#39; about developments.<br><br></div>I think that Mr. Noor Noor gives a very good presentation of the issues faced on both sides of the problem and he is clearly very passionate about finding a resolution. With the right level of support, from BLI and other parties, he could well be the chap that gets things done.<br>
<br></div>It is unfortunate that the 2014-15 seasons will merely be &#39;monitored&#39; to ascertain the numerical facts, however, and I can&#39;t help but feel that yet another full season of slaughter may be &#39;one season too many&#39; for more than just a few species. From what we are seeing in Kenya, the numbers of migrants remain massively down on previous years, especially shrikes. Can one more year of &#39;by-catch&#39; really be allowed/ sanctioned? Surely there is a will, and therefore a way, to monitor the catch without kiling all the birds next year? Can the bird-ringers of this world not get together and monitor the catch, paying their way to keep the locals &#39;sustained&#39; until the previous year when more (or other) solutions can be found? <br>
</div><br></div>One such solution is very simple and I have yet to hear it mentioned or addressed - Quail farming. Numerous species of quail are intensively farmed around the world and so if the Libyan and Egyptian people are catching these birds out of economic need, surely BLI and others can provide the know-how and finance to set the people up in aviculture? <br>
<br></div>I&#39;m sure that between us all, we can come up with more simple and effective ideas but how do we get these in front of the right people, Nick?<br><br></div>Cheers for now,<br>Adam<br><br></div><div class="gmail_extra">

      <p>Greetings Kenyan Birders,</p><p></p><div><br></div><div>For those interested in the above issue, I urge you to follow this link to a BirdLife International report of a recent meeting held in Bonn, and hosted by colleagues at the AEWA Secretariat.</div>
<div><br></div><div><a href="http://www.birdlife.org/africa/news/concern-over-migrant-birds-prompts-international-response" target="_blank">http://www.birdlife.org/africa/news/concern-over-migrant-birds-prompts-international-response</a><br>
</div><div><br></div><div>Included in the report is a video interview with Noor Noor, Executive Coordinator of Nature Conservation Egypt.  Please do take time to listen to what Noor, and others have to say on the subject.</div>
<div><br></div><div>It will be a complex and challenging task to address this problem, especially given the other pressures facing the two Governments at the current time.  However, the meeting set the scene for important and ongoing international cooperation and support, which I believe provides real hope that a effective and long-term solutions can be found.</div>
