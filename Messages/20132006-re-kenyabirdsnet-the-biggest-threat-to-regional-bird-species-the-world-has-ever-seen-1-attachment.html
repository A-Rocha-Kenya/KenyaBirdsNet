  <P>Dear All on Kenyabirdsnet,<BR><BR>The petition to stop the slaughter of our 
  migrant birds is doing well<BR>and in its third day. We decided to monitor the 
  first 500 signatories,<BR>not to see who they are, but to get some idea of the 
  geography of<BR>support. In the last day we have written to all of the major 
  and<BR>regional Bird Tour companies, requesting that they advise all of 
  their<BR>clients of the existence of this movement to show Egypt that there 
  are<BR>more people against what they are doing than they seem to think 
  (or<BR>even care about).<BR><BR>I am sure that you will be interested in the 
  results in this first<BR>wave of support.<BR><BR>Kenya you have shown the true 
  spirit that Kenyans are renowned for, in<BR>greatly supporting this movement 
  you show you really care. Thank you,<BR>and thank you in advance for what you 
  are going to do to spread the<BR>word further.<BR><BR>Other great regional 
  support comes from Israel, thanks to all those<BR>who have shown your 
  condemnation of the heinous act, and again advance<BR>thanks for taking it 
  further.<BR><BR>Considerable support has come from South Africa, and all this 
  is so<BR>much appreciated to encourage change in favour of the 
  birds.<BR><BR>Apart from the regions that you would expect to support the 
  petition,<BR>surprises have been an unprecedented backing from the 
  Philippines,<BR>scattered votes throughout eastern Europe, encouragement from 
  other<BR>bird-slaughtering nations Cypress, Malta, the Middle East and 
  Egypt<BR>itself.<BR><BR>We can recommend the July 2013 issue of National 
  Geographic, possibly<BR>the finest edition that they have circulated. Very 
  interesting<BR>articles covering the Solar System, the last known individual 
  of a<BR>once numerous frog, a riveting look at geneology and evolution, 
  and<BR>the most gripping of all… “The Last Song,” giving horrifying 
  graphic<BR>detail of what is taking place to progressively exterminate 
  our<BR>migrant birds.<BR><BR>Jonathan Franzen and David Guttenfelder are the 
  unsung heroes of the<BR>day. The Franzen style of explicitness is very hard 
  hitting, whilst<BR>reading it shivers were travelling down the spine, thinking 
  that “you<BR>know, the next generation may never know what pleasures a fall 
  of<BR>Eurasian migrants can bring, or hear the cheerful chirrups as 
  flocks<BR>of Bee-eaters announce that they are back, or see parties of 
  fluting,<BR>gaudy Golden Orioles collect in fruiting fig-trees.”<BR><BR>David 
  Guttenfelder is a conflict photographer. That means that he<BR>spends his life 
  spanning the globe travelling from human misery to<BR>even more human misery. 
  Whilst he is enormously moved by what he sees,<BR>he states that nothing has 
  affected him as much as seeing what is<BR>happening to the Eurasian migrants, 
  and…. He is not a birder.<BR><BR>We have attached the extremely moving text 
  from the National<BR>Geographic issue, as little can compare with Franzen’s 
  ability to get<BR>the message across, move you to a state of despair and yet 
  also give<BR>some insight as to the people that are doing this, those to 
  survive,<BR>those to make huge profits commercially and those that are callous 
  and<BR>wealthy and kill the small birds just for the sheer pleasure of 
  doing<BR>it.<BR><BR>Let’s get more people to show this disapproval, 
  condemnation and share<BR>the disgust against what these people are doing to 
  the future of<BR>Africa.<BR><BR>Thinking of means of spreading the word, here 
  are a few ideas how you<BR>can assist with further support;<BR>placing this 
  article on your Facebook and Twitter accounts will<BR>exponentially assist in 
  spreading the word further, and showing a<BR>stronger solidarity towards 
  ending the current and impending horrors.<BR><BR>And, if you can add details 
  of this petition to your blog, website,<BR>any social media platform that you 
  use, that would be really great!<BR>Further still, if you like to post images 
  on web forums, such as<BR>birdforum, surfbirds, birdguides (among many 
  others), then please also<BR>provide the link to this petition. These migrant 
  birds need all the<BR>support that we can muster for them. Let's get this 
  message out to the<BR>world ASAP and hope that they have a chance!<BR><BR>You 
  know who we are, the Golden O support team!<BR><BR>Once again the site for 
  voting, and advising all your friends to 
  vote…<BR><BR>http://www.avaaz.org/en/petition/Egypt_must_STOP_killing_MILLIONS_of_migrant_insecteating_birds_before_FAMINE_and_PLAGUE_kills_MILLIONS_of_Africans/?copy<BR></P></DIV><!-- end group email --></BODY></HTML>
