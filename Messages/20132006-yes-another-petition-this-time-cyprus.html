                                        <div id="overview_truncate"><p>Cyprus is a stopping place for hundreds of millions of migrant birds moving between Africa, Europe and Western Asia each year..</p>
<p>300 different species use Cyprus as a stepping stone during their difficult and very tiring flights across the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Illegal shooting and trapping of birds ( with lime sticks and netting) is a persistent problem in Cyprus.</p>
<p>The number of birds trapped each year has increased since 2007, and has remained very high for the last seven years.</p>
<p>The main victims of the lime sticks are Warblers, Thrushes; but also 
Cuckoos, Owls, Shrikes, Bee-eaters and other protected birds are also 
caught.</p>
<p>750,000 birds are shot illegally each year in Cyprus. The Blackcap 
bird is specifically targeted illegally and is sold on as a delicacy 
known in Cyprus as Ambelopoulia.</p>
<p>Over 150 different species are effected each year, 78 of these are members of endangered species.</p>
<p>Hunting is considered a pass-time, adventure or sport and hunters are ready to shoot at anything that moves.</p>
<p>We have to respect the animals rights to live in this world.</p>
<p>Bird trapping has been banned on the island, but poachers continue to break the law..</p>
<p>The prosecution of the law is not strict enough, therefore let&#39;s act 
now to stop this mindless massacre by demanding an end to bird hunting 
in Cyprus.</p></div><br></div></div>
