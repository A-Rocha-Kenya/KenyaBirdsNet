  <pre>Dear All,
With all the Pacific Golden Plovers that seem to be going through East
Africa at present, I found this image that I have attached. It was one
of four birds together at Athi Dam in Nairobi National Park over ten
years ago. At present I cannot locate the date, as the old records
have long been superceded by old Word programmes and I know it was
saved on WriteNow. I think the party of four birds got into the
rarities round up for that year that Colin Jackson collates. Anyway as
well as substantiating this old record with the image, I thought that
it would also be interesting for people to know what they should be
keeping an eye out for.
Best to all
Brian
