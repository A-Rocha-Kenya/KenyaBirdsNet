  <pre>Dear All East African birders, and all those involved in some way with
East African birds,

Please take some time to read the contents on the site below. Nothing
has ever arisen before on such a magnitude to threaten our birds.

If you agree with the contents, if you are as concerned as we are
about the future of our continent then you should sign. You should
then use every means possible to get the message across for others to
sign and show Egypt that we are just not taking this lying down.

Thanks for all the anticipated support,

Brian
