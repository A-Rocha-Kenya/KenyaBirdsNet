  <pre>Dear All,
I am trying to locate this region in Kenya. An African Scops Owl was
collected way back in 1912, and given this location. There has
probably been quite a name change in the interim. Does anyone out
there know of this place and where it is, and what it might be called
now.
No use trying Google Earth, or Britton, not that easy.
Best to all and thanks in anticipation,
Brian
