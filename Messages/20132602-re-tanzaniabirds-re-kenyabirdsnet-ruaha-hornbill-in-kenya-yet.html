  <pre>Dear John,
Thanks for the information. How sad not to have the image. Keekerok is
a lot closer to Ruaha Hornbill than Northern Red-billed, we shall just
have to keep on trying.
Thanks again
Brian

&gt; Hi Brian,
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for these comments. Re images of the 1988 bird, I was in fact an avid
&gt; photographer at the time, but sadly that is one image I don&#39;t have!
&gt;
&gt; The sighting was not in fact at Cottars, but inside the Reserve, somewhere
&gt; east of Keekorok.
&gt;
&gt; Best regards, John (not Tony) Dawson

&gt;&gt; Dear All,
&gt;&gt; Thanks for the response I think you are right about altitude being a
&gt;&gt; probable factor between northern Serengeti and the Mara, but it
&gt;&gt; doesn&#39;t explain that we have not had it in the Lake Victoria basin
&gt;&gt; where contiguous vegetation and altitude is identical. On the Tz map,
&gt;&gt; we actually share three squares where they have been recorded in
&gt;&gt; Tanzania, admittedly along the border area it looks quite scarce. If a
&gt;&gt; Racket-tailed Roller can take the plunge, why hasn&#39;t a Ruaha
&gt;&gt; Hornbill!? Tony (Dawson) confirming receipt of your email as
&gt;&gt; requested. I don&#39;t suppose you have an image of the 1988 bird, I know
&gt;&gt; it was before cameras were invented, but...
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s not impossible that at Cottars, especially in drought conditions
&gt;&gt; that a Northern Red-bill could wander in, as much as a Ruaha wandering
&gt;&gt; up.
&gt;&gt; Best to all
&gt;&gt; Brian

&gt;&gt;&gt; Altitude is a factor with Grey-breasted Spurfowl (you have a population
&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Red-necked that may help stop our bird) and Fischer&#39;s Lovebird (these
&gt;&gt;&gt; birds
&gt;&gt;&gt; love Borassus Palms) and it USED to be with Rufous-tailed Weaver and we
&gt;&gt;&gt; thought with Karamoja Apalis (Acacia drepanolobium).
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; so it&#39;s not simply altitude but there are vegetation changes with alt
&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; you need a geologist to look closely at the soils. There is also the
&gt;&gt;&gt; question of subtle changes in temperature to be considered and perhaps
&gt;&gt;&gt; changes in rainfall.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Tony, hopefully you have insights into these ecological limits.

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Brian and all,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; This is a bird I was determined to find in the Mara and searched
&gt;&gt;&gt; endlessly
&gt;&gt;&gt; for it, particularly while working close to the southern boundary, but to
&gt;&gt;&gt; no
&gt;&gt;&gt; avail.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Despite Britton apparently recording it in the Mara, I wonder if
&gt;&gt;&gt; altitude
&gt;&gt;&gt; may be a prohibitive factor?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Adam

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear All,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Please look at the attached TZ Atlas map for Ruaha Hornbill. It must
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be on our side of the border.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Has anyone seen a Red-billed Hornbill in the Mara (I certainly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; havenâ€™t), or along our border area near Lake Victoria, if so it must
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be this species, still never recorded for Kenya.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Please check your records, and any images, you could have a first for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the country.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Best to all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Brian
