  <pre>Dear Fleur and all the Dakatcha team,
This is really exciting, and you are obviously close to solving the
mystery. I thought that they would be breeding in the Galana oxbows,
seasonal wetlands never occurred to me.
All interior forest weavers are non-social in breeding, so it made
sense that Clarke&#39;s would be in a wetland being such a highly social
species. I wonder how long the wetland has been there, if breeding had
been nearly over then you would have seen young birds... maybe they
are prospecting for a site now and the best is yet to come!
Congratulations again
Brian

&gt; Dear Jeremy and all
&gt;
&gt; Indeed, it was when Martin Odino saw the first Weyns¹s Weaver in Kenya in
&gt; October 2010 that I realized that Clarke¹s Weaver would probably also nest
&gt; in wetlands. Since then we have been looking in many seasonal wetlands and
&gt; hidden oxbow lakes as well as in Brachystegia woodland.
&gt;
&gt; The Clarke¹s Weavers we saw this week were not building or feeding young,
&gt; and the only nests we saw were Grosbeak Weavers¹. Monitoring will continue,
&gt; however ­ although not every day, for fear of disturbing the birds.
&gt;
&gt; With best wishes to all, Fleur

&gt;&gt; Dear Fleur and team,
&gt;&gt; This is really interesting. It¹s sounding very like the (similar looking)
&gt;&gt; Weyns¹s Weaver story in Uganda, also a social forest weaver - which is odd
&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt; itself - with long uncertainty about breeding sites. For Weyn¹s these
&gt;&gt; eventually proved to be in papyrus swamps on edge of Lake Victoria...(M.
&gt;&gt; Mills, 2007: Scopus 26: 44-46). I assume from your description that you
&gt;&gt; could
&gt;&gt; see enough to rule out breeding, or is it possible there were nests hidden
&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt; the vegetation that you couldn¹t see?
&gt;&gt; Best wishes
&gt;&gt; Jeremy

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Some exciting news from Dakatcha Woodland IBA in Kenya:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The first week of January 2013, a monitoring team from Nature Kenya and
&gt;&gt; Dakatcha Woodland Conservation Group visited Dakatcha Woodland IBA to look
&gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt; Clarke&#39;s Weavers. The group comprised Albert Baya, Japheth Garama, Samson
&gt;&gt; Katisho, Julius Mwambire, Kazungu Mboro Thuva, Samson Barisa, Maxwel
&gt;&gt; Issa,
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Kalama, Annet Sifa, Faith Mbago, George Odera and myself, Fleur
&gt;&gt; Ng&#39;weno. It had rained heavily in December, and many of the small wetlands
&gt;&gt; had
&gt;&gt; filled with water and water lilies.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; At about 10 am on January 6, after a survey in Brachystegia forest, we
&gt;&gt; drove
&gt;&gt; along the edge of a low area lush with grasses. A small part of it seemed
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; be deeper, with two kinds of Cyperus sedges growing in water. To our
&gt;&gt; surprise
&gt;&gt; and delight, we saw a flock of Clarke  217;s Weavers among the sedges.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The Clarke¹s Weavers were flying in and out, chattering, perching on the
&gt;&gt; sedges and on a tree and bush among the grasses, then disappearing among
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; sedges. Small flocks flew out and disappeared over the trees, and others
&gt;&gt; arrived and landed in the wetland. We estimated more than 100 Clarke¹s
&gt;&gt; Weavers, most of them males in adult plumage. There were also some females
&gt;&gt; (or
&gt;&gt; possibly immature males).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In the same wetland there were several Grosbeak Weavers, mostly males,
&gt;&gt; with
&gt;&gt; some old nests. They were displaying, singing, chasing each other and
&gt;&gt; sometimes chasing the Clarke¹s Weavers. There was also a flock of about
&gt;&gt; 40
&gt;&gt; Red-headed Quelea, mostly males, flying and landing with the Clarke¹s
&gt;&gt; Weavers;
&gt;&gt; this is a probable range extension. We observed the birds and their
&gt;&gt; constant
&gt;&gt; activity from our vehicle for about an hour and a half.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; As we did not want to disturb the birds, we left, then returned in the
&gt;&gt; evening
&gt;&gt; a t 5:30 pm to observe from the vehicle until about 7 pm. There was less
&gt;&gt; activity, and no queleas, but small flocks of Clarke¹s Weavers continued
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; fly in and out. The Grosbeak Weavers and at least some of the Clarke¹s
&gt;&gt; Weavers
&gt;&gt; remained in the sedges at nightfall.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The next morning, January 7, we were back at 5:30 am, still dark.
&gt;&gt; Grosbeak
&gt;&gt; Weavers became active at about 6 am, the Clarke¹s Weavers later. They
&gt;&gt; appeared
&gt;&gt; from the sedges, and small flocks flew out. As we left at about 7:30 am,
&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt; larger group of Clarke¹s Weavers flew in.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Our last observation was in the afternoon from 4:30 to about 5 pm. At
&gt;&gt; first
&gt;&gt; everything seemed quiet, then a few Clarke¹s Weavers were seen among the
&gt;&gt; sedges, and several small groups flew in. In short, we had observed
&gt;&gt; Clarke¹s
&gt;&gt; Weavers in this wetland for two days and one night.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; To the best of my knowledge, this is the first observation of Clarke¹s
&gt;&gt; Weavers
&gt;&gt; roosting in a wetland. (Or roosting anywhere for that matter?) The
&gt;&gt; behaviour
&gt;&gt; of the birds seemed to indicate they were evaluating the site as a
&gt;&gt; potential
&gt;&gt; breeding site. We plan to continue monitoring the site, and detailed
&gt;&gt; results
&gt;&gt; will be published.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This observation underscores the importance of conserving seasonal
&gt;&gt; wetlands as
&gt;&gt; well as Brachystegia forest for the survival of Clarke¹s Weavers. Our
&gt;&gt; thanks
&gt;&gt; to Nature Kenya and the communities of Dakatcha Woodland IBA for their
&gt;&gt; efforts
&gt;&gt; in conservation.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Wishing you good birding, Fleur
&gt;&gt;
