  <pre>Dear All,
Sorry for the delay in replying, we have only had one day of power in
the past five, and our primitive Power supply is getting me down!!!
Apart from the bill looking rather small, I cannot see anything else
that would make me think that this is not an African Hawk Eagle coming
out of the last vestiges of immature plumage, with the irregular
creamy buff wash.
The pale bases to the secondaries forming a pale panel in the wing,
fresh black streaking on the upper chest, broad terminal tail band,
short legs and feathered tarsus and pale eye are all are good features
for this species.
The appearance of the small bill might be attributed to a
foreshortening of the bird, as the angle of photograph looks quite
steep, but it does give the impression of being weak billed which s
additional paler than would be normal.
Apart from this I have no other suggestions as to where to look for
the id of this bird.
Best to all
Brian

&gt; Dear Adam and Akshay,I do agree with Shailesh 100% this is African Hawk
&gt; Eagle and in samburu you always get it along the river lines of the Park.

&gt;       Looks like a straightforward African Hawk Eagle to me.
&gt;
&gt; Shailesh - are you still in the UK or back in Kenya?
&gt;
