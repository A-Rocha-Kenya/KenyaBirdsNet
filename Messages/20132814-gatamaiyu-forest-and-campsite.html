  <pre>This weekend, a group of  photographers and I visited the Gatamaiyu forest. Our main aim was to  photograph the Bar-tailed trogon.
 We thought it would take us more time looking for the bird but the trogons were right there, so  buisy singing.
Unfortunately all the cameras went down due to low power.
This gave us good chance to look for other birds
1.berded woodpecker 2.cabanis greenbul 3yellow whiskered greenbul 4.montane white eye5.nothern double colored sun bird6.ashy fly catcher7.brown capped weaver.8black headed oriole 9. Hartlaub&#39;s turaco and many others.

Do we find white-winged apalis in Gatamaiyu? I had one, whose throat was soo white but am not sure which one it was since I had no photo.

Enjoy birdind! 
Tabitha
