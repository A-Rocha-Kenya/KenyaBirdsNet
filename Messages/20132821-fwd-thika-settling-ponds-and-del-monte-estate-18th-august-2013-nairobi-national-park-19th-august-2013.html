THIKA SETTLING PONDS AND DEL MONTE ESTATE 18th AUGUST 2013

Dear All,
I arrived at Nigel Hunters at 6.30am, and we set off for Thika,
meeting Darcy Ogada outside the entrance to the Thika Settling Ponds
at 8.00am. Just before the last descent to the ponds, Nigel and I were
being confused by swallows feeding from an overhead cable. See images
and discussion at end of these postings in the image section. If
anyone has anything to add, or different from my conclusions, please
feel free to comment as both Nigel and myself are very confused at
what we found.

It was a beautifully sunny day as we walked around the tanks. There
were more waders than expected, already forty each of Wood and Common
Sandpiper, only one Green, thirty Ruff and a compact seventy-five
Little Stints. An interesting situation at this time of year, is that
Common Sandpipers are presently more abundant than they ever are from
now up to the species departure. It would appear that whilst many
waders overfly in a hurry to reach their wintering grounds further
south, Common Sandpipers do mainly continue southwards, but stop in
for feed and rest before continuing their migration. Also that
although it is early, there was a juvenile identified (see image). It
cannot be that long since it was in the breeding area, being raised by
its parents so the more leisurely migration for the immatures is not
always the case, at least with this individual.
There were few ducks, the best being ten Fulvous Whistling-Ducks. An
attractive Madagascar Pond Heron was present (see image), and six
Crowned Cranes of which a pair had a juvenile and it is difficult to
imagine successfully nesting along the causeway with all the people
and animal traffic that goes through daily. A small pale grey backed
Lanner also paid a visit.
