  <pre>Dear All,
I am afraid I can only echo Adams recommendation. He should consult
the internet and read the innumerable reports available. Maybe also he
should contact Nature Kenya for the contacts for local guides in the
best birding places. If he is not willing to pay the charge for  a
local guide, then the value of his Kenya Birding experience will fall
exponentially. Very strange that he should write to Paula.
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Hi Paula,
&gt;
&gt; My best advice is for Mr Rockey is to use local guides at these sites at
&gt; every opportunity.
&gt;
&gt; Unfortunately, I&#39;m heading out of the door just now before a busy few days
&gt; but I&#39;m sure that other members of the group will be very happy to
&gt; contribute contact details for local guides for each of these great birding
&gt; locations.
&gt;
&gt; Best of luck with it all,
&gt;
&gt; Adam

&gt;&gt; Dear all,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I just got this email and have to admit total ignorance on some of his
&gt;&gt; questions regarding birds he wants to see ... and thought you&#39;d all be
&gt;&gt; better able to respond to William with advice/tips on his upcoming
&gt;&gt; safari?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Cheers

&gt;&gt; Hello,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Jeff Lincer told me you might have some advice for our planned trip to
&gt;&gt; Kenya
&gt;&gt; and Uganda this summer. Without hiring a long-term guide, my wife and I
&gt;&gt; will be traveling to Naivasha, Baringo, Kakamega, Bwindi, Kibale,
&gt;&gt; Budongo,
&gt;&gt; and Watamu by public transport. We plan on renting a car to visit the 3
&gt;&gt; Samburu reserves, the Masai Mara, and as an intro Lake Magadi and Nairobi
&gt;&gt; NP. As for lodging, we plan on camping the majority of the time.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Any suggestions for our DIY safari? Do you have any recommendations for
&gt;&gt; locating endemics like Sharpe&#39;s Longclaw, Williams&#39;s Lark, or Clarke&#39;s
&gt;&gt; Weaver?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Any advice is greatly appreciated. We&#39;re really excited to bird east
&gt;&gt; Africa!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Cheers,
&gt;&gt; -William Rockey

&gt;&gt;&gt; May Day greetings
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; The holiday was a good opportunity for Nature Kenya&#39;s Wednesday morning
&gt;&gt;&gt; birdwalk to drive up to Manguo Pond in Limuru. The water was expansive,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; although migrants had left, there were many birds.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Highlights included:
&gt;&gt;&gt; Maccoa Duck (at least one male)
&gt;&gt;&gt; About 60 White-backed Ducks, including small ducklings
&gt;&gt;&gt; Fulvous Whistling Ducks allowing close approach
&gt;&gt;&gt; More than 12 Purple Swamphen, with brown juveniles and larger immatures
&gt;&gt;&gt; Red-knobbed Coots nesting (and large juveniles)
&gt;&gt;&gt; African Jacana with young
&gt;&gt;&gt; Whiskered Terns apparently nesting
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Wishing you good birding, Fleur
&gt;&gt;&gt;
