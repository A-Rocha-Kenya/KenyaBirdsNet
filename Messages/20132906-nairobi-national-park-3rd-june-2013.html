  <pre>NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 3rd June 2013


Dear All,
Heather Elkins, Fleur Ng’Weno, Jennifer O’duore, Karen Plumbe and
myself met at the Main Entrance at 6.30am. The day was lightly
overcast, not particularly cold and it had not rained in the past two
weeks.

We gave the KWS Mess gardens a miss on this occasion and went straight
to the Ivory Burning Site, which did not produce anything of interest,
but we did have a male Golden-winged Sunbird shortly before arriving
there.
