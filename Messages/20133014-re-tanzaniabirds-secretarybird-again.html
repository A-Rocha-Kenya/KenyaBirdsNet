&gt; Dear All,
&gt; This is a bit of a sweeping statement, but I think in Kenya we are not
&gt; seeing a reduction in numbers and the species is still widespread.
&gt; Nairobi Park for instance has three breeding pairs one of which
&gt; fledged two young this week.  That said, I think there is no reason
&gt; for complacency, and whilst we do have a reasonable population we
&gt; should record all individuals, if there is a downtrend, we can monitor
&gt; from the start. Lets hope we never see that decline.
&gt; Best to all

&gt;&gt; HI
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In northern Tanzania, I wouldnâ€™t consider food supply a problem, you see
&gt;&gt; adults even on the outskirts of Arusha. I would imagine that outside of
&gt;&gt; protected areas one of the main problems is the vulnerability of the
&gt;&gt; nests
&gt;&gt; to people, mainly kids and possibly Pied Crows which continue to increase
&gt;&gt; and in our area mob everything!

&gt;&gt;&gt; many of you will recall that some of us put a hurried note together for
&gt;&gt;&gt; CITES on the plight of this bird a year or so ago.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; following on from this Sally Hofmeyr is writing up what we know for
&gt;&gt;&gt; official publication.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; we are asking ALL of YOU to
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; A. provide any undocumented records hidden in your note books.
&gt;&gt;&gt; B. thoughts, even anecdotal ones, on the situation in an area you are
&gt;&gt;&gt; familiar with.
&gt;&gt;&gt; C. where it no longer occurs but there are historical records ...WHY
&gt;&gt;&gt; might
&gt;&gt;&gt; it have disappeared ?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; between us we have all the literature but any personal perspective would
&gt;&gt;&gt; be very much appreciated.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; please write to your group so others see your comments as these often
&gt;&gt;&gt; trigger memories and at least nudge others to reply.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; please cc your msg to Sally at &lt;salhofmeyr@gmail.com&gt;;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; many thanks
