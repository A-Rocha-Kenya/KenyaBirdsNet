  <hr/>
  <div dir="ltr"><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div>Dear All,<br><br></div>Further to Brian Finch&#39;s recent posts about the horrific slaughter of migrant birds in Egypt,  I have been eagerly awaiting some kind of online response from Birdlife International regarding the &quot;rumour&quot; of a boycott of tour companies but none has been forthcoming. <br>
<br></div>Personally, I would be surprised to hear of such a bold move from Birdlife as this doesn&#39;t seem to be their mode of working and could end up being counter-productive for them and ultimately the birds. However, given the severity of this issue, and depth of feeling in the birding community about the slaughter, I think it would be very appropriate for Birdlife to be seen to be doing <u>something</u> which, as far as I can see, they are not. A google search and look at their website turned up nothing of the sort but I would be happy to be corrected on this, preferably publicly on these forums.<br>
<br></div>I&#39;m hoping that the following information will prompt someone to suggest some action that can be taken as I am not well informed about the legalities of International Conventions and the like, but what I do know is this;<br>
<br></div>Egypt is a full signatory and participant to THE CONVENTION ON THE CONSERVATION OF MIGRATORY SPECIES OF WILD ANIMALS (which is sometimes abbreviated to CMS). I&#39;ve attached the document here. In fact, Egypt was in the very first group of signatories of the agreeent in 1983. Rather ironically perhaps, Malta and Cyprus, two countries with a sordid history of bird slaughter to surpass that of Egypt, are also signatories. I think this serves to prove that CMS is an absolute waste of time and money, promulgated by an inept and powerless UNEP, and should be replaced with tougher international binding agreements. <b>THE CURRENT AGREEMENT IS WORTHLESS AND WHOLLY INEFFECTIVE.</b> <b>FACT!</b><br>
<br></div>As to what we (i.e. birders who care and want to improve the situation) can actually do is a whole new question. I&#39;m not 100% convinced about the &quot;rumoured boycott&quot; as a potentially effective tool to solve the problem and I am more inclined to agree with Nick (who responded to Brian&#39;s email) when he suggest that &quot;the delivery of hand-outs and other literature in both Arabic and
 English containing carefully crafted messages about conservation and 
sustainable use options would be a good start&quot; but even this is just scratching the itch.<br><br></div>Would it be possible for all naturalists/ avaaz-users, etc, around the world  to unite and push for an International ban on bird-catching nets? They are so cheap to buy and mostly maunfactured in China (where else?). It is too easy for these people to get their hands on these nets. Permits for scientific use would have to be sought from the highest Government authorities.<br>
<br></div>I read recently about the idea of poisoning rhino horn and putting onto the Asian market for sale. Sure, some people will die (i.e. only rhino horn users, so no great loss) and the word would very quickly get out that these horns are now being poisoned. This would certainly have a strong impact on demand. <br>
<br>So my big question to you all is this; what could be done with the bird situation that would be as effective?<br><br></div>I hope that this mail will prompt you to respond as there must be a solution to the crisis and we must work and think together to come up with a solution.<br>
<br></div>Best to All,<br><br></div>Adam<br><div><br><br><div><div><div><br><br><div><div><br><br><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><br><br></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
