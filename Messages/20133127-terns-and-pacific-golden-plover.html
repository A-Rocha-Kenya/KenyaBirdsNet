    On Tues this week (24th Sept) on the beach in front of Mwamba (A
    Rocha Kenya conservation centre in Watamu) we had a flock of c.1,300
    Common Terns and a lot more passing out over the water in the lagoon
    heading south. They were clearly just having a brief rest before
    continuing on migration - but were stunning to watch in the late
    afternoon sunshine...<br>
    <br>
    on Weds (25th) afternoon while having a meeting on our flat roof I
    heard an unusual "whutu-wup!" call repeated coming from high
    overhead... needless to say the meeting was interrupted mid-flow and
    from the balcony we saw a flock of c.250 large waders flying quite
    high and purposefully south. It was a familiar sound but not one I
    could immediately place - but seeing the birds even without
    binoculars they were clearly large plovers and were certainly not
    Grey and the best option was Pacific Golden Plover... and that call
    <i>was</i> familiar, probably from our sightings at Tana River Delta
    each January. Checking on <a href="http://www.xeno-canto.org">www.xeno-canto.org</a>
    I found flight calls of PGP that matched what we had heard.<br>
    <br>
    This is the largest flock of Pacific Golden Plovers recorded outside
    of Tana River Delta in Kenya - but they were clearly on a mission
    migrating south. Where to? Neil - or others in Tz - have you got
    records of significant flocks of PGP anywhere in Tz? Rufiji? I bet
    you there is a spot where there is another non-breeding population
    of them along the EA coast, possibly in Kenya, but I'm not aware of
    any really suitable habitat before Tz...?<br>
    <br>
    Doing some preliminary Kenya Bird Mapping / atlassing (more
    information on this to come soon) in Arabuko-Sokoke Weds morning as
    well, we had at least two of the much rarer coastal race <i>suahelicus
    </i>of African Broadbill amidst the usual Arabuko species.
    Blue-cheeked Bee-eaters also flying overhead heading south over the
    forest that same morning and our first Barn Swallow - just a single
    bird (and still the only one I've seen so far this season) at Sabaki
    last week 18th Sept. <br>
