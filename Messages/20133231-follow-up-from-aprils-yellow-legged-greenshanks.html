  <pre>Dear All,
A follow up on the Yellow-legged Greenshank in Tsavo East in April,
then another photographed at Bungoma, I wrote to South Africa,
enquiring if they ever had ever found yellow-legged Greenshanks. It
appeared that no-one had heard of such a thing. Adam Riley wrote to
Hugh Chittenden, who said he had seen and photographed them twice. One
in Kruger, and the other in Okavango. We now have four images of
different birds, the interesting thing is, is that between the four
photographs they seem to cover plumages from breeding to winter
plumage. This strongly suggests that the leg-colour is not a result of
breeding condition, but there might be Greenshanks out there that
always have yellow legs. Maybe even a population!
In the new RSA field-guide, they are now going to illustrate it!
Best for now
Brian
