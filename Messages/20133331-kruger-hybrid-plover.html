  <pre>Dear All,
This attached bird is in Kruger NP. It is obviously a hybrid of two
vanellus plovers. It has gone down in the records as a hybrid of two
species, but I really canâ€™t see how it can be the two that are
currently accepted. I have an idea, and it is just that because who
knows what is going to come up when throwing two species of very
different patterns together.
These hybrids are really intriguing, and the numbers seem to be increasing!
What do people think that the mix of parents would be that would
produce such a spectacular creature and why. (Something for the
weekend).
Best to all
Brian
