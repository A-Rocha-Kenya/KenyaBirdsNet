  <pre>LAKE NAIVASHA 7th April 2013

Dear All,
On 7th April Nigel Hunter and myself went up to Lake Naivasha. It had
rained heavily in Nairobi overnight, but there was not too much
evidence of this in Naivasha. The water level of the lake was still
high, but had not seemed to move in the past two months.
Our first stop was for the African Black Swifts, which have for the
fourth successive year returned to breed at the same time in several
Naivasha buildings. I donâ€™t know of any other building nesting Black
Swifts anywhere. There were well over a hundred flying low over the
buildings and down the main road affording excellent views. They are
readily found along Kenyatta Avenue on entering town down to the main
Naivasha-Mai Mahiu Road. This is a golden opportunity for studying
this species.
