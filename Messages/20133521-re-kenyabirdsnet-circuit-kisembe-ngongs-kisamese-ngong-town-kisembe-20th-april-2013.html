  <pre>Thanks Clive I found it after I had posted it. But why is the nominate
in China and not first described in Europe?
Best for now

&gt;
&gt; Not sure what you meant by (Strangely whilst there are several races of
&gt; daurica, there does not appear to be a nominate daurica daurica!). Nominate
&gt; occurs in W China &amp; C Asia.

&gt;&gt; CIRCUIT.. KISEMBE-NGONGS-KISAMESE-NGONG TOWN-KISEMBE 20th April 2013.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Dear All,
&gt;&gt; On the early morning of 20th April, Simon Ball, Mike Davidson and
&gt;&gt; Nigel Hunter met up at my house. There were single Red-backed Shrike
&gt;&gt; and Willow Warbler in the garden so migrants were still going through.
&gt;&gt; We all set off for a day in the rift below the  Ngong Hills. There had
&gt;&gt; been very heavy rain on the Ngongs, and places were flooded and the
&gt;&gt; rivers very full. On Leakey’s Road lookout, just before Corner Baridi,
&gt;&gt; Simon suggested we stop as he had seen migrant raptors using this
&gt;&gt; valley as a fly way in the past. We got out, and there were numerous
&gt;&gt; White-rumped Swifts flying back and forth along the slopes below us,
&gt;&gt; with them were twenty or so Barn Swallow, a few resident Red-rumped
&gt;&gt; Swallows, but the best was a very small palearctic Red-rumped Swallow
&gt;&gt; of the race rufula, (Strangely whilst there are several races of
&gt;&gt; daurica, there does not appear to be a nominate daurica daurica!).
&gt;&gt; The only East African record to date, for the palearctic race was one
&gt;&gt; trapped at Ngulia on passage in the autumn of 2011.
&gt;&gt; Other migrants here consisted of one Eurasian Hobby, two Lesser Grey
&gt;&gt; and one Red-backed Shrike, several Willow Warblers, two Tree Pipits
&gt;&gt; and a Sand Martin.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Barn Swallows were really on the move most of the morning and we saw
&gt;&gt; many on our circuit. Also a few more Willow Warblers, but just two
&gt;&gt; more Lesser Greys and one more Red-backed Shrike. Corner Baridi failed
&gt;&gt; to produce anything but the Lyne’s Cisticolas were very vocal. At the
&gt;&gt; bottom of the hill below Kisamese the road had washed away, but we
&gt;&gt; negotiated our way across, with some local “volunteers” trying to
&gt;&gt; charge Ksh500 to help us across! That’s what I call inflation! At the
&gt;&gt; large Dam, the water had flooded all the margins and it was not
&gt;&gt; possible to walk along the shore, there were a couple of Common
&gt;&gt; Sandpipers, and nominate White-headed Barbets calling from the figs.
&gt;&gt; Circling around to the Ngong road, there were many very noisy and
&gt;&gt; extravert Lynes’ Cisticolas, and of much interest a pair of
&gt;&gt; White-headed Saw-wings investigating some Cinnamon-chested Bee-eater
&gt;&gt; nesting holes in the bank of the road. All records of this species
&gt;&gt; east of the Rift Valley are interesting, but if these birds do choose
&gt;&gt; a hole and raise a family as it looks like they have every intention
&gt;&gt; of doing so, it may be the first ever case of proven breeding east of
&gt;&gt; the Rift in Kenya, but at present they are prospectors. The site is
&gt;&gt; about 100m down from the Savannah Club, in the road bank.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The only other bird of interest was a male Harlequin Quail flying low
&gt;&gt; past the Karen Roundabout whilst we were on it!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Best to all,
&gt;&gt; Brian
