  <pre>Dear All,
More details later, bu in case anyone is in the area..... Please find
attached image of a Heuglin&#39;s Wheatear along the main road right at
the junction to the swimming pool at Buffalo Springs.
Other interesting birds on the same date (7th Nov) included a Greyish
Eagle Owl, and an immature Lesser Grey Shrike on the wrong side of the
continent.

Another surprise came at Imenti Foreat on 10th Nov, when we found an
adult Western Banded Snake Ealge along a forest road. This is not only
well east of the Rift, but also over 7000 ft. There was a Lizard
Buzzard in the same place, but I have seen one here before.

Best to all
Brian
