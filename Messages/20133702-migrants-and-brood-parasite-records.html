  <pre>Greetings birders


It was a remarkable Wednesday Morning Birdwalk on the grounds of the
National Museums of Kenya on 2 October 2013. Everything seemed to be in
bloom Â­ Jacarandas, Dracaenas, stunning golden blossoms on small trees with
long cylindrical hairy pods, a Combretum shrub with bouquet upon bouquet of
white flowers, a Maerua or Cadaba shrub with powder-puff blossoms, and
aloes, orchids and fireball lilies.


For the first time, we witnessed two different brood parasites being fed by
their hosts on the same day:


Klaas&#39;s Cuckoo fed by Bronze Sunbird
and
Eastern (Green-backed) Honeybird fed by Montane White-eye


There were several Klaas&#39;s Cuckoos in the Museum grounds, including a
singing male. Later, some of the group saw (at close range) the male Klaas&#39;s
feeding a female. Or was it feeding a young cuckoo fed, raised and fledged
by the foster parents but begging irresistibly?


Migrants included Eurasian Bee-eaters flying over and our first Willow
Warblers and Grey Wagtail of the season.


Wishing you good birding, Fleur
