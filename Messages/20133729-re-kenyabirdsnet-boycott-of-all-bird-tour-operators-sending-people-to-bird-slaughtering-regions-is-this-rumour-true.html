<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>If it is true this would indeed be a very good move 
by Birdlife.&nbsp; I have read so many really alarming reports of the slaughter 
which is going on.&nbsp; We certainly have far less migrants now than in years 
gone by and one wonders if in a few years we are going to see any at all?&nbsp;

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>If a boycott could be&nbsp;encouraged by Birdlife 
Int. &nbsp;it might just be a wake-up call but&nbsp;in the countries 
where&nbsp;political mayhem is raging e.g. Egypt where people are being shot 
right left and centre will anyone worry about birds being shot?&nbsp;

  <P>Dear All,<BR>As I write millions more migrants are being slaughtered in 
  Egypt, and<BR>will not make it here to East Africa where without the 
  natural<BR>insecticide provided by these insectivores, crops will become 
  infested<BR>with insect pests and East Africans will go hungry.<BR><BR>It all 
  seemed so gloomy but the latest piece of news is that 
  Birdlife<BR>International is going to draw up a list and name and shame all 
  the<BR>bird tour operators that continue advertising and leading bird 
  tours<BR>in Egypt, but in addition other bird slaughtering regions 
  Cyprus,<BR>Malta, Sardinia, Morocco, and others.<BR><BR>At present this is 
  just a rumour, but if true it is a great move that<BR>Birdlife will be sending 
  this message, they must be congratulated for<BR>taking this radical step, and 
  we must support them in this endeavour.<BR>They will of course be recommending 
  a total boycott by concerned<BR>birders for all companies continuing to 
  operate in these countries.<BR><BR>Has anyone else heard about this, I really 
  think it is a good move and<BR>they must be congratulated for taking this 
  approach. It will at least<BR>make the whole issue of annual bird slaughters a 
  world wide problem to<BR>be rectified and not just regional as it is now. Lets 
  hope that the<BR>other major conservation groups all over the world follow 
  suit.<BR><BR>Best to all<BR>Brian<BR></P></DIV><!-- end group email --></BODY></HTML>
