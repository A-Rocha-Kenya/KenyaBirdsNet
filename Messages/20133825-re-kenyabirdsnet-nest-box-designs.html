  <div dir="ltr">Colin,<div>My own experience here in Kenya has been limited but I will say that I have found honeybees a very serious competitor for cavities be they man made or not.  I do think its worth finding out what the optimal honeybee cavity is (I believe for instance that honeybees like to go in then up into a larger space above) and then making a cavity that does not always meet those requirements.  In the past year I have put up two barn owl boxes (amercian design), one in Langata and one at Burguret. Both were promptly occupied by bees.  If I was to try again I would change the design so that the entrance was high on the box and the birds hop down. I might look for other changes too that would discourage the bees.  I have had luck with starlings and barbets with pieces of giant bamboo with a drilled entrance hole but even some of these (despite being very small) were occupied by bees.</div>
<div>Cheers, Jamie</div><div>PS Mpala has had success with hornbills (red-billeds and von derdeckens) in boxes too</div><div><br></div></div><div class="gmail_extra"><br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Mon, Nov 25, 2013 at 9:09 AM, Colin Jackson <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:colin.jackson@arocha.org" target="_blank">colin.jackson@arocha.org</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>

      <p>Anyone out there with experience in what nest box designs work for what <br>
species here in Kenya/ EA?? There are some good opportunities for <br>
introducing nest boxes in various places but immediate information is <br>
quite limited to find.<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>
