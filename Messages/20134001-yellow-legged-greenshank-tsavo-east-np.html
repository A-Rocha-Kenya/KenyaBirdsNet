  <pre>Dear All,
Just completing processing the last of the images taken on the recent
week trip to the coast. One more bird of interest in Tsavo East NP, in
between Satao and Aruba Dam was this yellow-legged Greenshank, which
must be at the upper end of the scale for yellow legs in this species.
Best to all
Brian
