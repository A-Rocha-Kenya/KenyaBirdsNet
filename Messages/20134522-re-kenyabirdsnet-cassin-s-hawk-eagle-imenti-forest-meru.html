  <pre>Hi Titus,
Raptors are a very difficult group at any time, but in this instance
look at the feet, and compare them to any Accipiter and I am sure you
will change your thoughts,
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Dear Peter,
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for this great shot.This looks like an immature accipiter  Looking at
&gt; the last picture to the left, long tail, spotted under tail coverts on the
&gt; 1st and the 2nd picture, the dark mustache on the throat, suggest it should
&gt; be Norther Goshawk.
&gt;
&gt; Regards,

&gt;       Dear All,
&gt; On a our way back 28 Feb 2013 from Meru National Park on a
&gt; productive raptor survey with the Raptor Working Group of Nature Kenya, we
&gt; decided to make a brief stopover at Imenti forest to look for some
&gt; interesting
&gt; birds that we might see. On a quick glance at the forest from the roadside
&gt; we
&gt; sighted a young brown raptor with some heavy streakings on the belly
&gt; against
&gt; the rufous breast  perched on the canopy.
&gt; We did not have a consensus pertaining to its real ID and so we decided to
&gt; take
&gt; a photo of it and share it with other raptor ‘fundis’. It was with great
&gt; excitement when Simon Thomset and Rob Davies confirmed to us that it was a
&gt; juv.
&gt; Cassin`s Hawk Eagle(attached above),which is extremely rare here! It`s
&gt; primarily a Central and West African forest raptor which unfortunatey does
&gt; not
&gt; appear in our Kenya fieldguides. However regional guides show its eastern
&gt; most
&gt; reach as the forest of extreme western Uganda . Its first documented
&gt; sighting is a specimen that was collected in Mt.Elgon in 1926. Its second
&gt; sighting
&gt; was in 2006 by Brian Finch. Have a look at the photo and share your opinion
&gt; with us.
&gt;
&gt; Other observers included Darcy Ogada,Ben Mugambi and Shiv
&gt; Kapila.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks to the Peregrine Fund for sponsoring the trip and
&gt; Ben`s Ecological Safaris for the logistical support.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Best regards,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
