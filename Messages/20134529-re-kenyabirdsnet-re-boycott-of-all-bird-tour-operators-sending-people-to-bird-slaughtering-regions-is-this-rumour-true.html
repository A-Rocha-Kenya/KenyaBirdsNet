&gt; Hi Brian,
&gt;
&gt; I haven&#39;t heard about this policy and would be rather surprised if it is
&gt; found to be true. I heard nothing mentioned about such a boycott at last
&gt; month&#39;s BirdLife World Congress in Canada and it would seem to run counter
&gt; to the organisation&#39;s policies to date.
&gt;
&gt; Personally, I think this move could well be ineffective and actually
&gt; counter-productive.
&gt;
&gt; Isn&#39;t one of the best way to persuade people to change their own behaviour,
&gt; or those of their fellow citizens, to actively engage with them and to
&gt; communicate face-to-face?
&gt;
&gt; I anticipate that, in Egypt at least, the number of annual BirdTours
&gt; and Birdwatchers is miniscule when compared with other interest groups such
&gt; as sun-seekers, sightseers, divers, photographers, etc. etc.  If Birders
&gt; stop visiting the country would anyone actually notice? Let
&gt; alone consider changing their behaviors? And besides there won&#39;t be anyone
&gt; or anything to demonstrate to local people that there are
&gt; alternative ways of doing things.
&gt;
&gt; I believe that a concerted campaign spearheaded by BirdLife but
&gt; utilising BirdTour Operators and their Clients would likely be far more
&gt; effective.  Developing hand-outs and other literature in both Arabic and
&gt; English containing carefully crafted messages about conservation and
&gt; sustainable use options would be a good start. Then BirdTours and their
&gt; Clients could use these leaflets to actively engage with anyone and everyone
&gt; they meet in the country.
&gt;
&gt; My experience in Egypt is that people are highly inquisitive when they
&gt; see a Birdwatcher in the field, and they are always amazed to look through
&gt; binoculars or a scope. However, most visiting Birders (including myself) are
&gt; unable to communicate effectively in the local language so opportunities for
&gt; real engagement are almost always missed.
&gt;
&gt; What if all BirdTour Operators committed to carrying say 500 leaflets
&gt; in their vehicles on every trip, and Clients were actively encouraged to
&gt; hand them out? Surely this is likely to be far more effective at tapping
&gt; into local people&#39;s interests and good sense? After all, the Bedouin tribes
&gt; were actaully practicing ecological sustainability thousands of years before
&gt; the concept was even recognised in the West!
&gt;
&gt; Best regards,
&gt;
&gt; Nick

&gt;&gt; Dear All,
&gt;&gt; As I write millions more migrants are being slaughtered in Egypt, and
&gt;&gt; will not make it here to East Africa where without the natural
&gt;&gt; insecticide provided by these insectivores, crops will become infested
&gt;&gt; with insect pests and East Africans will go hungry.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It all seemed so gloomy but the latest piece of news is that Birdlife
&gt;&gt; International is going to draw up a list and name and shame all the
&gt;&gt; bird tour operators that continue advertising and leading bird tours
&gt;&gt; in Egypt, but in addition other bird slaughtering regions Cyprus,
&gt;&gt; Malta, Sardinia, Morocco, and others.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; At present this is just a rumour, but if true it is a great move that
&gt;&gt; Birdlife will be sending this message, they must be congratulated for
&gt;&gt; taking this radical step, and we must support them in this endeavour.
&gt;&gt; They will of course be recommending a total boycott by concerned
&gt;&gt; birders for all companies continuing to operate in these countries.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Has anyone else heard about this, I really think it is a good move and
&gt;&gt; they must be congratulated for taking this approach. It will at least
&gt;&gt; make the whole issue of annual bird slaughters a world wide problem to
&gt;&gt; be rectified and not just regional as it is now. Lets hope that the
&gt;&gt; other major conservation groups all over the world follow suit.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Best to all
&gt;&gt; Brian
