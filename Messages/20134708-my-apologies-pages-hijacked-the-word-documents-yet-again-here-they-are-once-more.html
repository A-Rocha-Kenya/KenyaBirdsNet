  <pre>CHAMPAGNE RIDGE, CORNER BARIDI, MAGADI ROAD 30th June 2013

Dear All,
For something different Nigel Hunter and myself, thought we would
explore Champagne Ridge.
On our way to our destination for the day, we had a Cape Rook in
Ongata Rongai, and another three birds shortly before Kiserian. The
bird has certainly established itself in this area.
We birded slowly along the road as far as the junction after fourteen
kilometres when we turned back. Interesting finds along the road was a
Leonotis field with many very nice Malachite Sunbirds with a couple of
golden-wings. In the short grassland we found some ten Temminck’s
Coursers in various places, and a Kori Bustard. On a rocky scarp
overlooking the Rift Valley there were a couple of Lyne’s Cisticolas,
and Zanzibar Sombre Greenbuls singing from the cliff tops. In the
grassland we found mixed Athi Short-toed and Red-capped Larks. One
patch of scrub had a female Violet-backed Starling, whilst there were
singles each of male Capped and Schalow’s Wheatears. One of the
strangest sight was a compact flock of over forty Greater Blue-eared
Starlings, which flew high as a compact group and continues south over
the Rift until out of sight.

On the return we had a look at the new large dam at Kiserian on the
Isinya Road. It was obviously still quite sterile, only producing ten
Little Grebes, a few Red-knobbed Coot and Egyptian Geese.

NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 1st July 2013

Dear All,
Heather Elkins, Fleur Ng’Weno, Karen Plumbe and myself met at the Main
Entrance Gate to Nairobi National Park at 6.30am.
It was grey and gloomy and remained so up to our all leaving at 11.00am.

On the decent road there was a small party of feasting Yellow-bellied
Waxbills, whilst the Ivory Burning Site failed to produce anything of
interest.

The drift before Nagalomon Dam had an immature Spotted Thick-knee,
exactly where the adults used to be found regularly until a few months
ago. On the dam itself were two Darters, just three Black-crowned
Night-Herons, Purple Swamphen was calling, and a few Black-and-White
Mannikins feeding in the reeds. Whilst on the grassy bank was a single
of the rare lily Cyrtanthus sanguineus.

On the back road to Hyena Dam there were a couple of calling Meyer’s
Parrots, whilst at the dam there was a Little Grebe which is unusual
on this dam. We were having our morning coffee and snacks when a flock
of Cattle Egrets flew over, and a young Tawny Eagle intercepted the
flock and snatched a young egret from the midst. It flew off with it
but the egret struggled free and fell into the water. It made the
mistake of taking off again, and the eagle was in hot pursuit and
after flying around in circles, it grabbed the egret again and flew
with it down to the ground where it proceeded to devour it. The egrets
bill was entirely black testifying to it being a young bird. Whilst in
the same place an African Water Rail called, and a Lanner flew over.

In the rank grass in the run-off, White winged Widowbirds are starting
to increase in numbers, there was just one Jackson’s but quite a few
Red-collared Widowbirds and a couple of Cardinal Queleas. Additionally
a few small parties of Orange-breasted Waxbills were along the road.

All in all, there was some excitement with the eagle performance, but
otherwise it was a cold grey day and not too much wanted to move.

MBEGU FARM AND SANCTUARY FARM, NAIVASHA 7th July 2013

Dear  All,
Nigel Hunter and myself left Nairobi at 6.30am and arrived at Mbegu
Farm at 7.50am. Nairobi was in a typical grey and cold, miserable
state, and the mist was very thick from Limuru up to the 8000ft view
point. Suddenly it was like a light was switched on, we were very
suddenly in a beautiful day with clear blue skies and lots of
sunshine. All during the time we were at Naivasha the weather was
beautiful and not one cloud ever blocked the sun. At 3.00pm we climbed
back up the escarpment for our return journey, it was clear and bright
until we got to the 8000ft view point and the grey veil of gloom
descended and it was like this all the way back to Nairobi, and had
been like this for the entire day.

As we drove through Naivasha town, Black Swifts were flying amongst
the buildings as if nesting.

At Mbegu Farm we walked down to the waterfront, like all of Naivasha
the waterfronts are closer now than for many many years, and
everywhere stands of acacias out in the lake bear testament to the
incursion of the water. There was a good assortment of birds, the best
here was probably three Darter, but there were a good selection in the
woodlands including both Black-lored and Arrow-marked Babblers, and
Brown Parisoma. A black Gabar Goshawk was stirring a few things up.
