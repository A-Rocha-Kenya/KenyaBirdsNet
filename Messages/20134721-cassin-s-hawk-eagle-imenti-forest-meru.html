productive raptor survey with the Raptor Working Group of Nature Kenya, we
decided to make a brief stopover at Imenti forest to look for some interesting
birds that we might see. On a quick glance at the forest from the roadside we
sighted a young brown raptor with some heavy streakings on the belly against
the rufous breast &nbsp;perched on the canopy.
We did not have a consensus pertaining to its real ID and so we decided to take
a photo of it and share it with other raptor ‘fundis’. It was with great
excitement when Simon Thomset and Rob Davies confirmed to us that it was a juv.
Cassin`s Hawk Eagle(attached above),which is extremely rare here! It`s
primarily a Central and West African forest raptor which unfortunatey does not
appear in our Kenya fieldguides. However regional guides show its eastern most
reach as the forest of extreme western <st1:country-region w:st="on">Uganda</st1:country-region>. Its first documented
sighting is a specimen that was collected in Mt.Elgon in 1926. Its second sighting
was in 2006 by Brian Finch. Have a look at the photo and share your opinion
with us.</div>
