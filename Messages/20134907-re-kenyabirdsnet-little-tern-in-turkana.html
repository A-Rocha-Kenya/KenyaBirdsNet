<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Exciting news! This&nbsp;has made me think again 
about my own experience on a trip to Lake Turkana in April 2001. I saw a flock 
of about 20 small terns with yellow bills with black tips sitting on the spit 
which juts into the lake just south of Koobiforra on the eastern shore. I was in 
a boat&nbsp;passing by (with a majority of non-birders!), and battling with a 
heavy swell, so we did not stop, but I&nbsp;automatically assumed that they were 
Saunders (following the literature of the day). Now it seems that they were more 
likely to have been Little. Can't be proved either way, but next time (I wish!) 
I'll insist on stopping the boat and having a good look.&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>&nbsp;Very best wishes to all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <P>Hi Martin,<BR>That's really good. Once you are back could you also do a 
  write up on<BR>the Little Terns for the East African Rarities Committee and 
  send it<BR>to Nigel Hunter at <A 
  href="mailto:nigelhunter@timbale.org">nigelhunter@timbale.org</A>&gt;<BR>Thanks 
  for this and lookingforward to reading further of what you<BR>found up 
  there.<BR>Best for now<BR>Brian<BR><BR>On 3/5/13, Martin Mwema <A

  Thanks Brian. I have been keeping a look out for saunders's terns as 
  well<BR>&gt; but none so far. The problem is that most of the birds are in 
  non-breeding<BR>&gt; plumage. Luckily with the groups I have seen there have 
  been some birds in<BR>&gt; breeding plumage.<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; The other 
  exciting find is a roost of about 1,000 african skimmers. So far<BR>&gt; they 
  have been using the site fairly consistently in varying numbers. Other<BR>&gt; 
  than that I have been seeing small numbers of species that you would<BR>&gt; 
  normally find at the coast such as Terek Sandpiper (1), Whimbrel (2) 
  and<BR>&gt; Eurasian Curlew (3)...I also counted over 3,000 Great White 
  Pelicans at<BR>&gt; Ferguson's Gulf. I'll send a list around once I am 
  done.<BR>&gt; Best,<BR>&gt; Martin<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; --- On Tue, 3/5/13,

  Date: Tuesday, March 5, 2013, 5:18 AM<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; Dear Martin,<BR>&gt; 
  This record is very exciting, and goes a long way to helping to<BR>&gt; 
  understand the presence of Little Tern in East Africa. Your birds<BR>&gt; 
  apart from the White-winged Black are all Little, and if you had<BR>&gt; 
  eighty like this then that is a great record.<BR>&gt; Sweeping comments 
  like.... Saunders Tern also occurs on Lake Turkana<BR>&gt; have clouded past 
  records. We now know that Little Terns are the bird<BR>&gt; of the lakes, and 
  Saunders is primarily coastal. I had one bird in<BR>&gt; breeding plumage at 
  Loyengelani two years ago at this time at dusk. I<BR>&gt; have never been 
  convinced that I have seen a Rift Valley Saunders, but<BR>&gt; Little on 
  Turkana, Baringo, Naivasha and Nakuru. Records are<BR>&gt; increasing in 
  Tanzania as well with small flocks wintering at Speke's<BR>&gt; Bay on Lake 
  Victoria. That said, whilst Saunder's inland may be<BR>&gt; suspect, Littles 
  do also move along the coast, but they are probably<BR>&gt; overlooked for the 
  best part.<BR>&gt; What else did you have at Turkana this is a very special 
  time of year<BR>&gt; there, and you should have had some other exciting 
  finds,<BR>&gt; Best for now<BR>&gt; Brian<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; On 3/5/13, Martin
