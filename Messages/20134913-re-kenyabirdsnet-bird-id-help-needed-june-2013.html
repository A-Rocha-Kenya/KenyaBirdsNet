  <pre>Dear Richard,
Thanks for sharing this with us. All of your photos are as you say
they are, Common Redshank, rare enough but what an incredible date,
Swamp Nightjar, you cannot mistake the extensive black cheeks, and of
course all white outer-tail feathers, Blue-breasted Bee-eater... where
exactly were they in Mumias? In that area they have never been seen
away from Nambale and with an immature too!
Great records here,
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Dear All,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I have currently been birding around the country with some friends and have
&gt; a few sightings that I would like to share and confirm with you all. Your
&gt; help would be greatly appreciated and I would welcome any and all comments.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; On June the 2nd we found what we presume to be a Common Redshank at Lake
&gt; Nakuru National Park. Please find attached a picture of this bird. From the
&gt; field guide this bird is not common inland and certainly should not be here
&gt; in June. From the photo can anyone confirm that this is indeed a Common
&gt; Redshank?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; On the 5th of June my friends and I ventured into the Kerio valley and we
&gt; were fortunate to find a Gambaga Flycatcher, two Chestnut-crowned
&gt; Sparrow-weavers and a Stripe-breasted Seedeater all in the same tree. While
&gt; we were watching these birds Boran Cistciola and White-crested Turaco&#39;s
&gt; were
&gt; calling in the valley below. For those of you that have not traveled to
&gt; this
&gt; part of the country it is spectacular and the birds are fantastic.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; On the 6th of June we were in Kakamega Forest. Highlights were two
&gt; sightings
&gt; of African Shrike Flycatchers, an African Broadbill, and an unusually
&gt; obliging Black-billed Turaco that posed for a few shots. Please find one
&gt; attached.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The 7th of June was spent near Busia and Mumias. We unfortunately broke
&gt; down
&gt; in Mumias and spent three hours in sugar cane fields searching for any
&gt; birds
&gt; we could find. We happened across a few Bee-eaters that I&#39;m guessing are
&gt; Blue-breasted Bee-eaters. Please find attached two images of these birds.
&gt; They were working the edge of the sugar cane fields and a marshy area
&gt; nearby. With the recent discussion on this forum surrounding Blue-breasted
&gt; Bee-eaters can anyone either confirm or refute my identification. I have
&gt; never seen this species in Kenya before and would love some feedback.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; On the 10th of June we were driving between Talek and Keekerok in the Mara
&gt; Reserve. We were watching a Coqui Francolin walk down the road and into the
&gt; grass when suddenly a nightjar was flushed by the francolin. It landed on
&gt; the road and then scuttled into the grass. The brief look I had at the bird
&gt; grabbed my attention and we drove down the road towards where the bird
&gt; disappeared with cameras ready. It flushed as we drove by and we were able
&gt; to snap some shots of it before it dove back into the grass. Can anyone
&gt; confirm from the images attached that this is indeed a Swamp Nightjar. I
&gt; have never seen this species before and from the range map it appears to be
&gt; very rare in the Mara.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Other interesting sightings from the trip that you all might find
&gt; interesting were a brief encounter with a Brush-tailed Porcupine in
&gt; daylight
&gt; in Kakamega. A Forest Night Adder in Kakamega swallowing a frog on the
&gt; trail
&gt; and 4 African Wild Dogs hunting on the road between Lemek and Aitong.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Take Care everyone and I appreciate all help with identification in
&gt; advance.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt;
&gt;
