  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" ><tr><td valign="top" style="font: inherit;">Hi Birders,<br><br>Happy New year. Following last years road construction work in Nairobi a number of birds were displaced due to lose of nesting sites( yellow-backed acacia tree) were destroyed. More affected were the juvenile Marabou Storks. Thank to Sofi Walker ( staff at KSPES), who saved the young storks on her garden and eventually released them safe to the wild when they attained right age to fly. Before the birds were released she invited us to ring them with plastic rings, orange and green.&nbsp; Are these birds safe? do they have a place to nest or do they make local migration?&nbsp; Common birds may not be that common every where. We can also use them to monitor both ecological and infrastructural ( Konza City, super high ways etc) changes within the environment.&nbsp; Any one out there that happens to see these birds please let us know so that we
 can at least monitor their success in the wild. A total of 20 birds were ringed. Attached are some photos.<br><br>Best regards and Happy birding.<br><br>Titus Imboma<br><br><blockquote style="border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); margin-left: 5px; padding-left: 5px;"><div id="yiv604101328"><div><div id="yiv604101328ygrp-mlmsg" style=""><div id="yiv604101328ygrp-msg" style=""><div id="yiv604101328ygrp-text"><div><div><span class="yiv604101328Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Helvetica; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal;"><br><br></span>
