  <pre>On monday 28th january 2013 me and my collide went out for field work at Wema irrigation scheme, while we are driving on we did an eye count of birds at the scheme between TARDA and wema.As per situation we fear to use the Binos for birding due to security alarts. we come up with this
Saddle billed stork 1
open billed stork 2
Black headed heron 20
Hammerkop 4
greater egret 5
itermediate egret 10
Cattle egret 106
long tail comorant 1 
Egyptian goose 47
Spur winged plover 40
