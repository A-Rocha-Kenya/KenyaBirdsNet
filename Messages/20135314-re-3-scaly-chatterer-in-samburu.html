&gt;Dear All,
&gt;I have spent a few hours going through the latest I.O.C. Checklist to
&gt;the Birds of the World, to see how this new arrangement affects our
&gt;Kenya Checklist.
&gt;
&gt;In the details that follow, where two or more species are joined by an
&gt;“&amp;”, it means that we have all of these forms in Kenya, but they are
&gt;currently lumped.
&gt;
&gt;Where it states “Separate From” this denotes that the first bird
&gt;mentioned is ours, but the species it is now split from is not in our
&gt;region, but they are currently lumped
&gt;
&gt;Anything else that is substantial change is also mentioned,
&gt;
&gt;If this were adopted it would bring major changes about to our current
&gt;checklist,
&gt;
&gt;Best to all
&gt;Brian
