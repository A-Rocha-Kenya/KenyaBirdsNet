  <pre>Dear All,
I photographed the House Crow near the temple at Makindu a few hours
ago on the return journey from Tsavo. It is obviously liking it there,
and having negotiated the Tsavo Plain (thought to be a barrier for
spread from the coast), the rest of the country is now wide open to
invasion, Nairobi will start losing its birds very soon if something
is not done immediately.
Best for now
Brian

&gt;&gt; As bad as it might sound I don&#39;t support &#39;killing crow&#39; initiatives. When
&gt;&gt; will man learn to respect nature &amp; let it propagate itself in its own way.
&gt;&gt; Let nature take course!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi all
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Someone MUST talk to someone in Authority in government.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; We have taken our abt 1.2 million house crows in Tanzania using DRC1339
&gt;&gt;&gt; and traps.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Traps work ... crows DO NOT learn, we kill them before they can !!
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; One must kill them in the dark after birds outside have gone to roost.
&gt;&gt;&gt; leaving 2 birds in the trap to attract others the following day.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Our President has 10 working traps in State House. They have taken out
&gt;&gt;&gt; more than 100,000 crows in the past 4 years.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Fresh food and clean water every day is all it takes........ and a
&gt;&gt;&gt; certain amount of common sense !!!
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; stop talking abt it in Kenya and DO IT.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
