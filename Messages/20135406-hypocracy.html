  <pre>On an easy note, I am a absolute believer (seriously...), so when it comes, I will give a hard hour for my God that what kind of pot he smoke when he made this mess down here?! He must be very stoned! BTW, tell me whats the difference between bribe and lobby? If you like that better, I don&#39;t mind a lobby. Especially if its the same...

***Apparently some people are claiming the moral high ground (not for the first time).***
Again and exactly... somebody has to do it! Otherwise chemical weapons will be very popular at many places, very soon! 

Cheers, Lajos
