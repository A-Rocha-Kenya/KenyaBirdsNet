  <div dir="ltr"><div><div><div>Hi All,<br><br></div>Find attached a couple of late evening fly-by shots of a Bat Hawk that appears to have taken up residence in the area recently. I&#39;ve been out looking for its roosting site today but without success. The bird typically emerges around 6.15pm and then disappears by 6.35pm, often heading in the direction of Karen Crossroads. It can usually be seen hawking low over trees but last night it dashed low over my head and swooped past a bush seemingly after a Bulbul that was calling from there.<br>

<br></div>Cheers for now,<br></div>Adam<br></div>
