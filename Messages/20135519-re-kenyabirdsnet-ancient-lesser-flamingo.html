  <pre>Hi Colin,
This is utterly incredible, this news has to go well beyond the net,
as it is quite groundbreaking. I think the only extant ringed bird
that is a little older is a Manx Shearwater which has in its lifetime
flown over one million kilometres, and it must be a lot more as they
do considerable weaving, following currents, weather changes etc.

Then there is mingi thanks to Nick Armour who had the foresight to
collect the ring and follow up on it.

Best for now
Brian

&gt; Dear Colin Jackson,
&gt;
&gt; I hope all is well with you. That is very interesting news the 50 years old
&gt;
&gt; flamingo( true Jubilee) since it was ringed. What a stunning News to
&gt; the Science about our birds on our rift valley lakes. You can imagin
&gt; how many of these birds died some few years back and we did not find
&gt;
&gt; any with rings. You are right this news should be highlighted on our local
&gt;
&gt; for public awareness. Where is this individual bird? Can we prepare a
&gt; specimen and display it with ring in the Museums. I will be happy follow
&gt; on this if it is present.
&gt;
&gt; Best Regards,
&gt; Titus
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; The Ringing Scheme of East Africa has just received news of a Lesser
&gt; Flamingo that was found freshly dead at Lake Baringo on 13th February this
&gt; year with a ring. The incredible thing about it is that the ring was a BTO
&gt; ring (British Trust for Ornithology) that was one of those rings used on a
&gt; batch of several thousand Lesser Flamingo chicks that bred at at Lake Magadi
&gt; in....1962!!
&gt;
&gt; This bird was in fact ringed by none other than the very well-known
&gt;     Leslie Brown on 1st November 1962 making it 50 years, 3 months and 25
&gt; days old!
&gt;
&gt; It must surely be the oldest recorded Lesser Flamingo and quite
&gt;     stunning that it lived for so long. A few years ago there was one
&gt;     recovered also at Magadi that was about 45 years old - there may be
&gt;     one or two more out there with rings from that time!
&gt;
&gt; If anyone receives this who knows more about that ringing event of
&gt;     Lesser Flamingo chicks in 1962 - or was perhaps even there and took
&gt;     part, it would be really interesting to know the full story. I
&gt;     believe many of the chicks had got &#39;anklets&#39; of encrusted soda
&gt;     formed around their legs which were acting as a &#39;ball and chain&#39; and
&gt;     were killing the birds. Rescuers were breaking the balls of
&gt;     encrusted soda off and putting rings on thus saving the lives of
&gt;     many flamingos - some to live to over 50 years later!
&gt;
&gt; The person who found the flamingo is Nick Armour of Swavesey,
&gt;     England, to whom we are indebted for reporting the ring. The
&gt;     distance from ringing site to recovery site is 242kms.
&gt;
&gt; We need to spread the word of what ringing is about so that members
&gt;     of the public who find ringed birds know what to do with them - i.e.
&gt;     report them to the ringing scheme / museum. If anyone reading this
&gt;     has opportunity for publishing stories or reports in newspapers /
&gt;     magazines / report on radio etc, please do so. There must be dozens
&gt;     of rings found by the public that are never reported due simply to
&gt;     ignorance of what they are.
