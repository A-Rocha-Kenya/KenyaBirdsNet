  <html><body><div style="color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt"><div>Hi all,</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>I was also in the same area (Kamendi near River Chepkaitit ) a few weeks back and spotted a ross's turaco, a&nbsp;red-collared widowbird, a&nbsp;black-headed heron, two southern ground horn-bills, a black and white casqued-hornbill and a woodland kingfisher. I had a camera with me hence managed to take a few&nbsp;shots&nbsp;without flushing the beautiful creatures. However, I couldn't manage to take a shot of the Turaco. It's a pretty elusive one. Perhaps with a long lens and some much needed patience, it will allow me to take a snapshot someday.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>happy birding,</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Evans</div></div></body></html>
