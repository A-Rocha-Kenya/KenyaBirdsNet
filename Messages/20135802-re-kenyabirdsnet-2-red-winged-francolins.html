  <pre>Hi Chege,
In April three or four years ago, I had a pair between the Oloololo
Gate and Serena, which I videoed and had never seen in the Mara
before, then after fifteen kilometres another single on the road! I
have never seen them since, but Adam Kennedy had the species in the
south of the reserve.
Best for now
Brian
