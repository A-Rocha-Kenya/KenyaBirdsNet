<div>
<div>Dakatcha Woodland Conservation Group and Nature Kenya are happy to report 
that Clarke’s Weavers are breeding in Dakatcha Woodland Important Bird Area in 
March 2013.</div>
<div> </div>
<div></div>
<div>The breeding grounds of this endemic and endangered bird have been a 
mystery for many years. David Ngala and Don Turner saw adults feeding flying 
young in Dakatcha Woodland in 1994, but the actual nesting site had never been 
found. Nature Kenya has had a project to monitor the weavers and raise community 
awareness in Dakatcha Woodland IBA since 2005, and I have visited Dakatcha 
Woodland with the local team regularly since 2007. When Martin Odino found 
Weyns’ Weaver in Kenya, we learned that this Ugandan bird foraged in forest but 
nested in swamps. Since then we have searched the wetlands of Dakatcha Woodland 
as well as the Brachystegia woodland.</div>
<div> </div>
<div></div>
<div>On 6 January the team found a flock of Clarke’s Weavers in a seasonal 
wetland of grass and sedge, but we could not see them either building or 
feeding. Smaller monitoring teams found the weavers in the same wetland in late 
January to early February and again in early March. Not wanting to disturb the 
birds, we did not venture into the wetland.</div>
<div> </div>
<div></div>
<div>Then on 22 March a team composed of Jonathan Mwachongo, Patrick Changawa, 
Julius Mwambire, Japhet Garama, Kazungu Thuva, Samuel Kenga, Samson Katisho, 
Peter Wario and myself, Fleur Ng’weno, visited the area again. There had been 
some showers of rain, and all the Brachystegia trees were vibrantly green and in 
flower. At the wetland, however, our hearts sank; the sedges had been cut for 
thatch. We collected a few empty nests on the ground to take to the National 
Museums of Kenya.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The next day, 23 March 2013, we visited another seasonal wetland fairly far 
away, and found a flock of Clarke’s Weavers flying in and out of the wetland. 
Perhaps we had found another site! Our hopes were re-kindled. (The next day, 
however, the weavers had left, and we noticed that there was no water where the 
sedges were growing.)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On the way back to the campsite, we passed a seasonal wetland where we had 
stopped several times in other years. Should we check it again? Of course! And 
we found a large flock of Clarke’s Weavers in the sedges.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We observed the Clarke’s Weavers carefully from the shade of trees 
bordering the wetland. There were several hundred, males and females, actively 
flying back and forth across the wetland. Some males seemed to be displaying, 
others just perching on the sedges. They were making their buzzing, sizzling 
calls. Then we saw the brownish, rounded shapes of nests. A few males flew in, 
carrying strips of building materials. One male was seen weaving more sedge 
strips onto a nest. This was it! The breeding site.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The next morning we arrived at 6:10 am and found the Clarke’s Weavers 
already active, flying back and forth within the wetland and singing. Frogs and 
toads were also calling. Then flocks of 60 to 100 birds began to lift up from 
the wetland and fly up and away. We presumed they went to feed in the forest. 
Seven flocks flew off in the next half hour, giving us an estimate of about 550 
birds. Many weavers could still be seen in the wetland. We estimated the group 
to be about 700 birds – perhaps as many as one thousand. We took photos and a 
video.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A few men, women and children from nearby homesteads came to the wetland to 
collect water. They were at the far end of the wetland from the weaver site and 
did not seem to disturb the birds.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On 26 March, we were joined by Mike Davidson, George Odera and Brian Finch 
from Nature Kenya and Colin Jackson and Silas from A Rocha. They brought 
telescopes for better viewing and took photos. The weavers were still active, 
but less busy building; many of them sitting on top of the nests. Brian Finch 
estimated some five hundred nests concentrated in the small area of sedges 
within the grassland.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The breeding of Clarke’s Weavers in Dakatcha Woodland is thus 
confirmed.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Dakatcha Woodland Conservation Group, with support from Nature Kenya, is 
taking active steps to protect this first known breeding site. Representatives 
will visit the area later this week to talk to the local elders. They will also 
inform the representatives of the government in the area. We hope that once the 
people living near the wetland realize the importance of these birds – found 
only in Kilifi County and nowhere else in the world – they will take steps to 
see the wetland is not disturbed.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This finding will be published in greater detail, and with photos, 
later.</div>
