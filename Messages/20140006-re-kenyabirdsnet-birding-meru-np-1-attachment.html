Dear Samuel,
Thanks for sending in the image of the Accipiter.

Were it not for the conspicuous and persistent noisy display of
African Goshawks, we would hardly know they were there, as they keep
well hidden in deep cover. So whilst we do not encounter perched
adults that often, we see immatures even less frequently.

I don&#39;t believe your accipiter to be Levant, their eyes are very deep
red not black, though can be difficult to judge in the field.  They
rarely show anything resembling a pale supercilium as in this bird,
the undeparts of the young are brown spotted, never heavy black
patterning across the breast. Their upperparts range between brown and
dark grey in adults, but never charcoal black as in your image. An
immature Levant would show brown upperparts, and brown spotting below,
adults are barred. So I believe your bird an immature African Goshawk,
but with unusually dark upperparts. Female Eurasian Sparrowhawks can
be this dark above, but in all plumages the species shows barred not
spotted or blotched underparts.

Best for now
Brian
