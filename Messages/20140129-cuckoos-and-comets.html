  <pre>Season&#39;s greetings!

Levaillant&#39;s Cuckoo and African Emerald Cuckoo were the highlights of Nature
Kenya&#39;s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk at the Ngong Racecourse on 24 December.
There will be another birdwalk on 31 December.

Take your binoculars out at night to see Comet Q2 Lovejoy! I&#39;m told it can
even be seen with the naked eye from a dark location. The constellation of
Orion, rising in the eastern sky in the evening, can guide you to the comet.
Rigel, a bright blue-green star, is to the right (south) of Orion&#39;s &#34;belt&#34;
of 3 stars in a row. To the right of Rigel and lower in the sky, look for a
hazy, fuzzy spot of light.

Wishing you good birding and sky watching, Fleur
