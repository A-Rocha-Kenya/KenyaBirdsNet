  <pre>Hi Neil,
Reciprocated compliments of the season. No the Crowned Cranes are only
just back after an absence for several months, since they were
breeding in the rains. We have no idea where they go to. Large numbers
of non-breeders collect in various places like farms around Naivasha,
Kitale/Elgon, Kabarnet/Iten regularly exceeding 100 individuals. We
know nothing about crane movements in this country, I whilst I hope to
be corrected, I don&#39;t think any serious studies have ever taken place
on this enigmatic bird, that gives any incites to their comings and
goings.
best for now
Brian

&gt; Brian and all
&gt;
&gt; are your GCCs resident in Nairobi NP ?
&gt;
&gt; I ask because we have a regular 100+ flock on the NW face of Kilimanjaro
&gt; that I&#39;ve always felt were Kenyan breeders.
&gt;
&gt; If not from NNP where might they have originated ?
&gt;
&gt; thanks and cheers for the new year.
