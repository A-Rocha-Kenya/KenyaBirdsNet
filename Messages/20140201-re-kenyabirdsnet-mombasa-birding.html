  <P>Hi Marlene,<BR><BR>Simon saw an Albatros out at sea on Friday 24th January, 
  the first one we have seen <BR>for ages. The usual Albatros we get here is the 
  Shy. We used to see them regularly <BR>from about August onwards and Don 
  Turner was out with Pat on one occasion and <BR>had one right up to the boat, 
  they were throwing fish to it and he identified it as a <BR>Shy. Pat also saw 
  a Masked Booby in the first week of January.<BR><BR>Maia<BR><BR>On 27 Jan 2014

  &lt;donreid@africaonline.co.ke&gt;<BR><BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; Bird Walkon 
  18th Jan at Haller Park: South Quarry:<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; First bird was African 
  Fish Eagle flying overhead but the quarry was pretty quiet. The ponds seem 
  <BR>&gt; to be somewhat polluted and water birds were few. In fact a tidal 
  puddle was more interesting <BR>&gt; with Three banded Plovers, Ringed Plover 
  (unusual away from the beach), Little Stints and <BR>&gt; African Pied 
  Wagtails. The only other migrant wader was a solitary Common Sandpiper at one 
  of <BR>&gt; the ponds; a splendid Malachite Kingfisher did give us all a very 
  good view. Purple Heron taking <BR>&gt; off was just a brief glimpse. As there 
  was so little about and as we were being harassed by a very <BR>&gt; 
  determined male Giraffe, tact seemed to be the better part of valour and so we 
  adjourned to <BR>&gt; Haller Park. There we saw another 15 species which 
  included Black Capped Night Heron, African <BR>&gt; Harrier Hawk, two more 
  African Fish Eagles (one may have been the one seen earlier) Giant <BR>&gt; 
  Kingfisher, another common Sand and an amazing 4 Black Herons who very 
  obligingly did their <BR>&gt; umbrella fishing together right in the eye of 
  Doris's camera. A total of 34 species in all.<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; Last week 
  spending 5 days at Tiwi Beach was very happy to see for the first time in ages 
  a good <BR>&gt; number of migrant waders. They all seemed to be in species 
  groups: 60-70 Grey Plovers, 18 <BR>&gt; Whimbrels, large group of Great with a 
  few Lesser Sand Plovers, a couple of Little Stints and 2 or <BR>&gt; 3 Ruddy 
  Turnstones. Latter 2 groups I just saw once and then in ones and twos but the 
  Plovers <BR>&gt; stayed together all the time and moved up and down the beach 
  together; maybe they are <BR>&gt; preparing to migrate? Lots of large shoals 
  of small fish jumping so a delight to watch the Lesser <BR>&gt; Creaster Terns 
  feeding. Best birding I have had at the beach for ages.<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; Today 
  was delighted to wake to the sound of Carmine Bee-eaters feeding over Tudor 
  Creek, a <BR>&gt; very rare event. What better way to start the week!<BR>&gt; 
  <BR>&gt; Did anyone manage to ID Doris's duck? Best guess I could come up with 
  was Northern <BR>&gt; Shoveler. Would love to hear from some more expert 
  birder.<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; Have heard there has been a sighting of an Albatross 
  around Likoni and just got a text from a <BR>&gt; Shanzu resident that it has 
  been seen there. He was IDing it as a 'Wandering" but according to <BR>&gt; 
  book that seems unlikely. Anyone on Birdsnet at the Coast - please keep an eye 
  open and a bino <BR>&gt; ready. <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; Marlene Reid
