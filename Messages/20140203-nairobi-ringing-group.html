22 individuals from 12 species, 5 were migrants (1 willow warbler, 2 
Blackcap and 2 Garden warblers). This was the happiest day for Nairobi 
ringing group, why? We capture major site control of Garden warbler 
sylivia borin (ring No. k72255) which was ringed here on 29/01/2013 this
 means it's exactly the same time and location, the bird was a year ago;
