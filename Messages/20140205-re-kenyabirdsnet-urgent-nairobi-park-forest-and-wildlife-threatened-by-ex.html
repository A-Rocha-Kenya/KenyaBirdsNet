Are Oribi Ourebia  ourebi also an &#39;introduced species&#39; to Nairobi National 
Park?  I  thought that this species was brought into NNP from SW Kenya 
(i.e., O.  o. cottoni). 
 
I am not aware of any earlier records of Oribi for the Nairobi  area.  Are 
there any such records?

Dear Paula and all,
This is horrifying, and shows why we have to keep an  eye on actions
taken by KWS in all sorts of their underhand manners, as you  said in
your previous correspondence they are so secretive in what they do.  Of
course what they do is completely illegal, and it&#39;s time that  the
conservationist minded public were fully aware of the mishandling  of
Nairobi National Park. It&#39;s so difficult nowadays to write  anything
complementary about KWS in Nairobi, but I suppose there must  be
something somewhere.
