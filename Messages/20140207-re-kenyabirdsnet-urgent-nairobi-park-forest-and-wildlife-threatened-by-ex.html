Good news, the NEMA boss just called me to tell me that after an inspection they issued a stop order as no EIA or stakeholder consultation has taken place. Hopefully this is a new opportunity to engage with and support KWS in improvements - afterall we are their customers and the rightful owners of the park. &nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>

Hi Tom,<BR>
I believe that the Oribi came from the Krugers Farm at Eldoret &nbsp;some<BR>
years ago when the habitat was under threat. Oribi have not been &nbsp;a<BR>
native to the area, but of course are found both in the west and &nbsp;the<BR>
east where they are common at Kipini on the coast.<BR>
At least they are &nbsp;a native Kenyan mammal which cannot be said for White Rhino,<BR>
Best for &nbsp;now<BR>

&gt; I don't believe &nbsp;that Oribi are native in the Nairobi. They are present in<BR>
&gt; Mara &nbsp;(although possibly not common) and certainly common in Ruma NP. It is<BR>
&gt; &nbsp;far from clear to me why they were introduced at all since unlike the<BR>

&gt; Are Oribi Ourebia ourebi also an &nbsp;'introduced species' to Nairobi National<BR>
&gt; Park? I thought that this &nbsp;species was brought into NNP from SW Kenya (i.e.,<BR>
&gt; O. o. &nbsp;cottoni).<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; I am not aware of any earlier records of Oribi for &nbsp;the Nairobi area. Are<BR>
&gt; there any such records?<BR>

&gt;<BR>
&gt; Dear &nbsp;Paula and all,<BR>
&gt; This is horrifying, and shows why we have to keep an &nbsp;eye on actions<BR>
&gt; taken by KWS in all sorts of their underhand manners, &nbsp;as you said in<BR>
&gt; your previous correspondence they are so secretive in &nbsp;what they do. Of<BR>
&gt; course what they do is completely illegal, and it's &nbsp;time that the<BR>
&gt; conservationist minded public were fully aware of the &nbsp;mishandling of<BR>
&gt; Nairobi National Park. It's so difficult nowadays to &nbsp;write anything<BR>
&gt; complementary about KWS in Nairobi, but I suppose there &nbsp;must be<BR>
&gt; something somewhere.<BR>
&gt; From my own standpoint the &nbsp;integrity of Nairobi National Park as a<BR>
&gt; reserve for native wildlife &nbsp;was breached when (and I am sure only for<BR>
&gt; a tourist attraction) White &nbsp;Rhinos were introduced to the Park. As<BR>
&gt; Kenya has never been the home &nbsp;for these beasts, (which I am very fond<BR>
&gt; of by the way), they have as &nbsp;little right to call NNP home as House<BR>
&gt; Crows in Mombasa, they are an &nbsp;exotic, never native to Kenya and should<BR>
&gt; not have been introduced into &nbsp;what up to then was a natural ecosystem<BR>
&gt; as far as mammalian species &nbsp;were concerned.<BR>
&gt; Had the White Rhinos not had been introduced, we would &nbsp;probably not<BR>
&gt; have had the associated problems that we have now, with &nbsp;them being a<BR>
&gt; magnet to poachers. They can only bring us trouble and &nbsp;the time is now<BR>
&gt; to relocate them in a safe area &nbsp;elsewhere.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Do you know that on Sunday, with Fleur and some &nbsp;visitors, we were<BR>
&gt; birding along the Cheetah Gate Road. We have always &nbsp;been exceedingly<BR>
&gt; suspicious of the great area of land along the &nbsp;Mbagathi in that little<BR>
&gt; visited SE corner, being fenced off. Whilst I &nbsp;don't think that<BR>
&gt; anything honest from KWS has satisfactorily explained &nbsp;the fencing of<BR>
&gt; this portion of the Park, now the road to Cheetah Gate &nbsp;has been<BR>
&gt; blocked with the electric fence continuing across the road &nbsp;from the<BR>
&gt; Cement Factory. This definitely looks like an Illegal &nbsp;Excision of a<BR>
&gt; large part of the Park to me, what do others &nbsp;feel?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Then of course there is the mystery fence at the back of &nbsp;Hyena Dam,<BR>
&gt; another Excision?, and what about the Pylons????<BR>
&gt; &nbsp;Best to all<BR>

&gt;&gt; Dear &nbsp;friends,<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; I was horrified today to see that KWS have &nbsp;started fencing off a huge<BR>
&gt;&gt; piece<BR>
&gt;&gt; of the Nairobi &nbsp;National Park for the major expansion of the Nairobi<BR>
&gt;&gt; Orphanage. &nbsp;See attached photo. The fence follows the main road from the<BR>
&gt;&gt; &nbsp;entrance all the way to the club house - which is almost to the &nbsp;ivory<BR>
&gt;&gt; burn<BR>
&gt;&gt; site.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; I am writing &nbsp;to request that you help me to demand an immediate halt<BR>
&gt;&gt; &nbsp;these<BR>
&gt;&gt; plans. I have identified the following arguments; you may &nbsp;have others<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; 1. Expanding the orphanage violates the &nbsp;very original purpose of the<BR>
&gt;&gt; orphanage - to home orphans and act &nbsp;as a half way house before they are<BR>
&gt;&gt; released. The orphanage was &nbsp;never intended as a zoo which is what it<BR>
&gt;&gt; seems<BR>
&gt;&gt; KWS &nbsp;wants to create. The Safari Walk on the other hand was created as &nbsp;a<BR>
&gt;&gt; zoo<BR>
&gt;&gt; - there is no need for two zoos in the same &nbsp;place in Nairobi. Moreover,<BR>
&gt;&gt; wilderness in the National Park should &nbsp;not be sacrificed for the creation<BR>
&gt;&gt; of or expansion of a zoo, &nbsp;instead a wholesome education experience<BR>
&gt;&gt; through<BR>
&gt;&gt; &nbsp;visitation to the park should be promoted as it is far more &nbsp;valuable.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; 2. The area for expansion will &nbsp;require the destruction of a sizeable<BR>
&gt;&gt; piece<BR>
&gt;&gt; of Nairobi &nbsp;Park. We are not aware of any EIA having been conducted, nor<BR>
&gt;&gt; are &nbsp;we aware of any stakeholder consultation having taken place. As &nbsp;you<BR>
&gt;&gt; know, FoNNaP which is 19 years old, has always defended the &nbsp;park and<BR>
&gt;&gt; although our board meets regularly with the warden, there &nbsp;has been no<BR>
&gt;&gt; consultation of these plans, and we have not been &nbsp;informed of these or<BR>
&gt;&gt; any<BR>
&gt;&gt; other plans for developments &nbsp;in the park.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; 3. We believe that these developments are &nbsp;in violation of the management<BR>
&gt;&gt; plan of the park which is already &nbsp;out of date having expired a few years<BR>
&gt;&gt; ago. It is also therefore a &nbsp;violation of the new Act which requires parks<BR>
&gt;&gt; to have management &nbsp;plans that are developed through a stakeholder<BR>
&gt;&gt; consultative &nbsp;process.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; 4. The area of land that is being fenced off &nbsp;will result in the<BR>
&gt;&gt; destruction<BR>
&gt;&gt; of highly endangered &nbsp;tropical highland forest including habitats for<BR>
&gt;&gt; endangered add &nbsp;endangered species, as well as species of concern<BR>
&gt;&gt; &nbsp;including<BR>
&gt;&gt; lions, jackals, leopard, Crowned eagle (one of the only &nbsp;2 nesting pairs<BR>
&gt;&gt; in<BR>
&gt;&gt; Nairobi nests in these trees), &nbsp;Suni, duiker, black rhino and forest hog<BR>
&gt;&gt; all<BR>
&gt;&gt; live in &nbsp;this part of the forest. I am sure there are also plants, birds<BR>
&gt;&gt; &nbsp;and other animals that will also be threatened. By degrading this &nbsp;habitat<BR>
&gt;&gt; and alienating it from the park the KWS will be violating &nbsp;the EMCA, and<BR>
&gt;&gt; failure to consult the stakeholders is in violation &nbsp;of the constitution.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; I have written to the Director &nbsp;KWS, NEMA Director and the CS to<BR>
&gt;&gt; respectfully request the &nbsp;immediate halt to the ongoing fencing of the<BR>
&gt;&gt; park,<BR>
&gt;&gt; as &nbsp;it is not too late to restore any damage already &nbsp;caused.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; I have also asked for an investigation to be &nbsp;initiated into how this<BR>
&gt;&gt; proposal was developed and passed without &nbsp;any stakeholder consultation or<BR>
&gt;&gt; &nbsp;EIA.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; Please help by sending your own &nbsp;letter to the Cabinet Secretary, KWS<BR>
&gt;&gt; Director (<a href="Director@kws.org">Director@kws.org</a>) &nbsp;and NEMA DG &lt;<a href="gmwahungu@gmail.com&gt;on">gmwahungu@gmail.com&gt;on</a> this<BR>
&gt;&gt; issue<BR>
&gt;&gt; &nbsp;so that they can see how serious this is.<BR>
