  <DIV dir=ltr>Good news, the NEMA boss just called me to tell me that after an 
  inspection they issued a stop order as no EIA or stakeholder consultation has 
  taken place. Hopefully this is a new opportunity to engage with and support 
  KWS in improvements - afterall we are their customers and the rightful owners 
  of the park. &nbsp;&nbsp;

      <P>Hi Tom,<BR>I believe that the Oribi came from the Krugers Farm at 
      Eldoret some<BR>years ago when the habitat was under threat. Oribi have 
      not been a<BR>native to the area, but of course are found both in the west 
      and the<BR>east where they are common at Kipini on the coast.<BR>At least 
      they are a native Kenyan mammal which cannot be said for White 
      Rhino,<BR>Best for now<BR>Brian<BR><BR>On 2/6/14, Bishop, Richard (ILRI)

      [KENYABIRDSNET] URGENT: Nairobi Park forest and wildlife<BR>&gt; 
      threatened by expansion of Orphanage<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; Dear 
      Paula and all,<BR>&gt; This is horrifying, and shows why we have to keep 
      an eye on actions<BR>&gt; taken by KWS in all sorts of their underhand 
      manners, as you said in<BR>&gt; your previous correspondence they are so 
      secretive in what they do. Of<BR>&gt; course what they do is completely 
      illegal, and it's time that the<BR>&gt; conservationist minded public were 
      fully aware of the mishandling of<BR>&gt; Nairobi National Park. It's so 
      difficult nowadays to write anything<BR>&gt; complementary about KWS in 
      Nairobi, but I suppose there must be<BR>&gt; something somewhere.<BR>&gt; 
      From my own standpoint the integrity of Nairobi National Park as a<BR>&gt; 
      reserve for native wildlife was breached when (and I am sure only 
      for<BR>&gt; a tourist attraction) White Rhinos were introduced to the 
      Park. As<BR>&gt; Kenya has never been the home for these beasts, (which I 
      am very fond<BR>&gt; of by the way), they have as little right to call NNP 
      home as House<BR>&gt; Crows in Mombasa, they are an exotic, never native 
      to Kenya and should<BR>&gt; not have been introduced into what up to then 
      was a natural ecosystem<BR>&gt; as far as mammalian species were 
      concerned.<BR>&gt; Had the White Rhinos not had been introduced, we would 
      probably not<BR>&gt; have had the associated problems that we have now, 
      with them being a<BR>&gt; magnet to poachers. They can only bring us 
      trouble and the time is now<BR>&gt; to relocate them in a safe area 
      elsewhere.<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; Do you know that on Sunday, with Fleur and some 
      visitors, we were<BR>&gt; birding along the Cheetah Gate Road. We have 
      always been exceedingly<BR>&gt; suspicious of the great area of land along 
      the Mbagathi in that little<BR>&gt; visited SE corner, being fenced off. 
      Whilst I don't think that<BR>&gt; anything honest from KWS has 
      satisfactorily explained the fencing of<BR>&gt; this portion of the Park, 
      now the road to Cheetah Gate has been<BR>&gt; blocked with the electric 
      fence continuing across the road from the<BR>&gt; Cement Factory. This 
      definitely looks like an Illegal Excision of a<BR>&gt; large part of the 
      Park to me, what do others feel?<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; Then of course there is 
      the mystery fence at the back of Hyena Dam,<BR>&gt; another Excision?, and 
      what about the Pylons????<BR>&gt; Best to all<BR>&gt;

      wrote:<BR>&gt;&gt; Dear friends,<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt; I was horrified 
      today to see that KWS have started fencing off a huge<BR>&gt;&gt; 
      piece<BR>&gt;&gt; of the Nairobi National Park for the major expansion of 
      the Nairobi<BR>&gt;&gt; Orphanage. See attached photo. The fence follows 
      the main road from the<BR>&gt;&gt; entrance all the way to the club house 
      - which is almost to the ivory<BR>&gt;&gt; burn<BR>&gt;&gt; 
      site.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt; I am writing to request that you help me to 
      demand an immediate halt<BR>&gt;&gt; these<BR>&gt;&gt; plans. I have 
      identified the following arguments; you may have 
      others<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt; 1. Expanding the orphanage violates the 
      very original purpose of the<BR>&gt;&gt; orphanage - to home orphans and 
      act as a half way house before they are<BR>&gt;&gt; released. The 
      orphanage was never intended as a zoo which is what it<BR>&gt;&gt; 
      seems<BR>&gt;&gt; KWS wants to create. The Safari Walk on the other hand 
      was created as a<BR>&gt;&gt; zoo<BR>&gt;&gt; - there is no need for two 
      zoos in the same place in Nairobi. Moreover,<BR>&gt;&gt; wilderness in the 
      National Park should not be sacrificed for the creation<BR>&gt;&gt; of or 
      expansion of a zoo, instead a wholesome education experience<BR>&gt;&gt; 
      through<BR>&gt;&gt; visitation to the park should be promoted as it is far 
      more valuable.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt; 2. The area for 
      expansion will require the destruction of a sizeable<BR>&gt;&gt; 
      piece<BR>&gt;&gt; of Nairobi Park. We are not aware of any EIA having been 
      conducted, nor<BR>&gt;&gt; are we aware of any stakeholder consultation 
      having taken place. As you<BR>&gt;&gt; know, FoNNaP which is 19 years old, 
      has always defended the park and<BR>&gt;&gt; although our board meets 
      regularly with the warden, there has been no<BR>&gt;&gt; consultation of 
      these plans, and we have not been informed of these or<BR>&gt;&gt; 
      any<BR>&gt;&gt; other plans for developments in the 
      park.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt; 3. We believe that these developments are in 
      violation of the management<BR>&gt;&gt; plan of the park which is already 
      out of date having expired a few years<BR>&gt;&gt; ago. It is also 
      therefore a violation of the new Act which requires parks<BR>&gt;&gt; to 
      have management plans that are developed through a stakeholder<BR>&gt;&gt; 
      consultative process.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt; 4. The area of land that is 
      being fenced off will result in the<BR>&gt;&gt; destruction<BR>&gt;&gt; of 
      highly endangered tropical highland forest including habitats 
      for<BR>&gt;&gt; endangered add endangered species, as well as species of 
      concern<BR>&gt;&gt; including<BR>&gt;&gt; lions, jackals, leopard, Crowned 
      eagle (one of the only 2 nesting pairs<BR>&gt;&gt; in<BR>&gt;&gt; Nairobi 
      nests in these trees), Suni, duiker, black rhino and forest 
      hog<BR>&gt;&gt; all<BR>&gt;&gt; live in this part of the forest. I am sure 
      there are also plants, birds<BR>&gt;&gt; and other animals that will also 
      be threatened. By degrading this habitat<BR>&gt;&gt; and alienating it 
      from the park the KWS will be violating the EMCA, and<BR>&gt;&gt; failure 
      to consult the stakeholders is in violation of the 
      constitution.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt; I have written to the Director KWS, 
      NEMA Director and the CS to<BR>&gt;&gt; respectfully request the immediate 
      halt to the ongoing fencing of the<BR>&gt;&gt; park,<BR>&gt;&gt; as it is 
      not too late to restore any damage already caused.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt; 
      I have also asked for an investigation to be initiated into how 
      this<BR>&gt;&gt; proposal was developed and passed without any stakeholder 
      consultation or<BR>&gt;&gt; EIA.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt; 
      Please help by sending your own letter to the Cabinet Secretary, 
      KWS<BR>&gt;&gt; Director (<A href="mailto:Director@kws.org"
