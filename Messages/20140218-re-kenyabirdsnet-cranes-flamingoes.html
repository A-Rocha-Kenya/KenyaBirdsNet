It&#8217;s a grey bird with a golden crown, and it&#8217;s called the Grey &nbsp;Crowned Crane to differentiate from the Black &nbsp;Crowned Crane of South Sudan.<BR>
<BR>
The Wednesday Morning Birdwalk cum Waterbird Count saw nearly two hundred Grey Crowned Cranes on the Brookside Dairies Ranch in Ruiru near Nairobi on January 29. I believe the cranes gather in large flocks like these during the non-breeding season. It&#8217;s encouraging to report this, as the Grey Crowned Crane is now listed as Endangered and its population has plummeted in Uganda.<BR>
<BR>
No one knows where the flamingoes will be in June or July.<BR>
<BR>

A friend of mine who lives out near Athi River has seen large groups of Grey-crowned Cranes (still prefer the Golden-crested name better). The group today numbered 43. I believe he saw 30-some before that, sometime last week. Today they were gathered by a large pond on one of the ranches out there. Is this normal and is it related to rains &amp; breeding, or perhaps migratory movements? <BR>
<BR>
Also, where would one go these days to see large #'s of Flamingoes? With all the Rift Lakes being so high recently, are the usual sites of Elementeita, Nakuru, and Bogoria any better or worse than Magadi? Some friends are coming out in June/July and would like to see the large flocks of flamingoes if possible. <BR>
<BR>
Thanks!<BR>
