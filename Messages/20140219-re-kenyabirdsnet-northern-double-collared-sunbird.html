  <pre>HI Neil,
In 2010 a group of us went and stayed a few nights in Nguruman (Loita).

Here is the entry in my report for the trip....

Eastern Double-collared Sunbird		Cinnyris mediocris
Pairs coming to bathe at a stream and a swamp below the Camp. The
presence of this eastern species in the Ngurumans is a surprise, and
it appears not to have been recorded in this region before.

We did not encounter any NDC Sunbirds at all,

Hope this helps,
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Brian, Don, and all
&gt;
&gt; What&#39;s the double-collared sunbird in the Loita Hills ?
&gt;
&gt; I ask because we have a claim of preussi from our Loliondo forests which are
&gt; a southern extension of the Loita.
&gt;
&gt; thanks
