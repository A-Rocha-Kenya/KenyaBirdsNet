Dear Itai

We&#39;ve just produced a report and summarised history of the ringing at Ngulia
over 40 years as a Scopus Special Supplement and have the copies here in UK.
This includes full details, with maps, of all recoveries, analyses of
biometric data, and a varied selection of photographs. This is available at
the special price of 12 Euros (includes postage) to Ngulia participants from
Europe. But I don&#39;t know the best means of payment for folk in Israel where
I&#39;m sure a few will be interested.

A few copies will be available by next month at 1000/- from NatureKenya and
more will reach there in August. Perhaps you could advertise this on
Kenyabirdsnet.

All the best
David
