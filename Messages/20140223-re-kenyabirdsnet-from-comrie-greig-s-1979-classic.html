  <pre>Thanks Tom and James,
That was very interesting. We could also site other major upsets like
the placing of Elsa progeny lions into Aberdares, then from there to
Nakuru. At the cost of Bongo and rangers. The translocation of the
Leopard to Ngulia at the cost of the Askari. The only truly successful
translocation on a species protection venture, that I can think of was
Rothschild&#39;s Giraffes to Nakuru, and in fact elsewhere.
My issue with the White Rhino in NNP, is unwanted attention
endangering everything else inclusive of tourists, but there is little
doubt that they are feeling at home, and are multiplying slowly. If
they were not an exotic, it would by luck (not scientific research
prior to the introduction) be a successful transplant, it just should
not be here,
Best for now
Brian

&gt; The below from James Culverwell.  James sent this to  me...as it relates
&gt; some to the points raised by Brian concerning &#39;exotic&#39; white  rhino in
&gt; Nairobi
&gt; National Park. Also oribi in that Park.

&gt; Leuthold  (1977) records several such instances of unsuccessful
&gt; mammalian  translocation, which he attempts to explain in terms of
&gt; behavioural  characteristics (lack of social cohesion, lack of
&gt; familiarity with home  range, etc.). It is possible, however, that
&gt; genetic factors played a part.  The cases recorded by Leuthold are: some
&gt; Uganda kob translocated from  western Kenya to the Mara Game Reserve
&gt; around 1963 have not been recorded  recently; a number of giraffe moved
&gt; from western to north-central Kenya in  1967/8 dispersed and are now
&gt; unaccounted for; some 35 roan antelope taken  to the Shimba Hills Reserve
&gt; in 1969 decreased by 1974 to 12 and now lead a  &#39;very tenuous existence&#39;;
&gt; the latter also applies to some Hunter&#39;s  hartebeest and Grevy&#39;s zebras
&gt; introduced into Tsavo National Park in 1963.  Disappointments such as
&gt; these should be more often recorded in print but  when it comes to
&gt; failures, human nature is an effective censor.
&gt;
&gt; It  is pleasing to record that the latest Grevy&#39;s zebra (Equus grevyz)
&gt; &#39;rescue&#39; operation in Kenya has been severely criticized (Reader 1979).
&gt; The translocation to Tsavo, beyond their natural range, is
&gt; scientifically unjustifiable, and has been attended by extensive
&gt; mortality. The professional game-catcher, Don Hunt, is quoted as
&gt; saying  that there was not time for the scientific evaluation of the
&gt; translocation  - &#39;We don&#39;t need scientists to tell us that zebras eat
&gt; grass.&#39; (Reader op.  cit.).
