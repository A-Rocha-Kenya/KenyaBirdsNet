  <pre>Hi Martin,

Looks like Great Sparrowhawk to me. Get the impression of a huge
accipiter (I may be wrong). Likely female, Black Sparrowhawk because
of the mostly brown plumage on dorsal body. Also blotchy pattern
rather than streaks, &#39;arrowheads&#39; (which I suppose you&#39;d see in the
Ovampo). claw is tricky in field; many accipiters all seem &#39;baseball
glove configured&#39; (long mid toe). Any views of the upper tail marking?
rows of white arrow-marks along the tail (not sure if at this stage
they&#39;d be showng)?

Humble regards
Martin

&gt; Hello Birders,
&gt; I encountered this sparrowhawk two weeks ago at Wasini Island as it tried to
&gt; catch a chicken. I identified it as a Juvenile Ovambo Sparrowhawk mainly due
&gt; to the prominent eye stripe, dark eyes. I was not able to get a good look at
&gt; the toes. Can anyone confirm my id? I don&#39;t know if there are many sightings
&gt; of this species from the coast, it&#39;s definitely my first at the coast.
&gt;
&gt; Best,
&gt; Martin
