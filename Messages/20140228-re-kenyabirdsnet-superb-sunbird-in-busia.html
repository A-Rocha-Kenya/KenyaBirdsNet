  <pre>Hi Chege,
And a very Happy New Year to you. The Mumias Piapiacs are still on the
rubbish tip?
In the past before the wholesale destruction of the habitat, I used to
see Superb Sunbird at Mungatsi with some regularity. The last Superb I
have seen in Kenya is at Alupe where there is still a lot of habitat
suitable for them, but that sighting was four years ago, and I don&#39;t
think there has been one recorded in Kenya since.
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Hi all
&gt; Just to report that while guiding for Exotic Birding on 1 Dec at
&gt; river Mungatsi we had a male Superb Sunbird. The dark maroon on the
&gt; belly to side running down the flanks were quite visible especially
&gt; when the bird came out in the light. We had him for about a dozen
&gt; minutes and occasionally he came out to the sunlight otherwise bigger
&gt; portion of the time spent watching him, he fed right inside the tree
&gt; bushes where canopy seemed thick. Frequently he raised a blue crest
&gt; kind off at the back from the top of the nape reminding me the old
&gt; punk hairstyle. Non of us had brought the camera on the walk but at
&gt; lunch having picnic i went back to the same place and spend about
&gt; 30min in search but in vain.
&gt;
&gt; Same day we had 2 Piapiacs at Mumias and the previous day we had a
&gt; Black-billed Turaco in Kakamega Forest
&gt;
&gt; Cheers and best wishes for the year 2014
