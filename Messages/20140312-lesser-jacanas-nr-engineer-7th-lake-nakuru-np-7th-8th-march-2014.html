  <pre>LESSER JACANAS, NR ENGINEER 7th &amp; LAKE NAKURU NP 7th-8th March 2014

On 7th March, Mike Davidson, Karen Plumbe and myself, were going to
visit the Lesser Jacanas near Engineer, we thought it would be
interesting to continue on to Nakuru with a night at Hotel Kunste.
Then have a second look at Nakuru the following morning.

As we were going up there, Simon Ball and Peter Usher came as far as
the Lesser Jacanas, then returned back at mid-day.

The Lesser Jacana chick had grown quite remarkably in the past week,
and now looked half the size of the adults.

On the way there, we checked out some highland grassland just before
Njabini, but were very nicely rewarded by a superb adult
Rufous-breasted Sparrowhawk, which came and circled over us.

There was not much else of note at the Jacana swamp, a dozen
Yellow-billed and one Red-billed Teal, a few Red-knobbed Coot and
Little grebes, some half-dozen Wood Sandpipers. There was a Common
Buzzard in a neighbouring paddock.

To reach Nakuru we took the C69 all the way to Lanet (via Ol
Kalou/Ndundori). It is a superb road, not too much traffic and
attractive countryside. It was so nice to go from Nairobi to Nakuru,
and not touching the main highway after turning off at the Kinangop
Flyover, and reconnecting at Lanet.

In the time spent in the Park, on Friday afternoon and Saturday
morning we investigated much of the Park in the vicinity of the
distended Lake. Distended as the water seems to come from within
rather than rainfall from without.

To show the dramatic change in Lake Nakuru ecosystem, there is a
montage of images taken this visit to show the damage.

Firstly there were certainly thousands of flamingos on the Lake, this
excludes large numbers feeding on the sewage farm. There were no large
gatherings but small and largish parties were at various parts of the
new foreshore, and also feeding inside the flooded forest, which is an
incongruous sight. Not very many Greaters, but adult Lessers looked
healthy and very pink. We actually did not see any dead or dying
birds, although it is difficult to imagine that they are finding
sufficient blue-green algae in such a freshwater environment.

There is no doubt that the avifauna is impoverished to what would be
expected at this time of year. Very few White Pelicans, but small
gatherings of Pink-backed. Stork numbers very low, but some clusters
of Yellow-billed, most Marabous being on the north shore. Near Muyas
causeway were a pair of Saddle-billed Storks, but there was only one
White and no Black Storks at all. Herons were in low numbers, it is
difficult to estimate numbers as they are all through the flooded
forest, however it seemed to be less than a hundred Yellow-billed and
Little Egrets and maybe only tens of Greats. Very few Grey compared to
the number present under more normal conditions. Only a couple of
Squacco, and no Black Egrets and less common herons. Very few Glossy
Ibis, although a flock of thirty were near Lion Hill. African
Spoonbills were scattered but there were no parties, and numbers were
well down. Not many Little Grebes were seen compared to the usual
thousands that reside on the Lake. The only Black-necked Grebes were
two on Muyas. Great Cormorant numbers well down, no evidence of any
attempt at breeding, Reed Cormorants were in much smaller numbers.

There was a scattering of Black-winged Stilts fairly much throughout,
but the only Pied Avocet were three at Muyas. Ruffs were in large
numbers but so scattered, undoubtedly in thousands. Little Stints may
have been in thousands, they were certainly widespread. Marsh
Sandpipers were common and like Wood Sandpipers really difficult to
guestimate. Common Sandpipers were fairly scarce, and as were
Greenshank. Ringed Plovers were in fairly good numbers. Of the less
common waders, there were five Temminck&#39;s Stint in the Muyas area, and
with all the oozy swamps all along the east shore, maybe there are
considerably more. Just one Spotted Redshank on the South shore, and
five Black-tailed Godwits on the North shore. Only three Common Snipe
were seen, and no coastal waders, or Little Ringed Plovers.

The three normal terns were present, again reduced numbers, and
strangely no White-winged Blacks showing breeding plumage yet. There
was a flock of about two-hundred Grey-headed Gulls on the south shore,
but no other gull species seen, and only a single gull on the whole
north shoreline.

Plenty of Cape Teal, no large flocks but widespread, three Northern
Shovelers at Muyas, and six Garganey literally at the Main Entrance....
which is a very productive area in the early morning and all the birds
so tame.

Raptors were very poorly represented, migrants were just three Common
Buzzard, one Eurasian Honey Buzzard, three Eurasian Marsh Harriers and
no falcons.

Other migrants were one Eurasian Roller, one Eurasian Bee-eater, a
smattering of Willow Warblers, but no migrant chats, and just one
Tukestan Shrike. Barn Swallows were in good numbers, and some Sand
Martins amongst them as to be expected. We saw some thirty Yellow
Wagtails, every last one a flava.

There were no unusual resident species, around the hill north of Main
Gate, were several Grey-rumped Swallows, possibly they may nest in the
short grass here.

Best for now
