  <pre>Dear All,
In Athi Dam in Nairobi National Park we have had somewhere close to
200 White Storks coming in to refresh each mid-day for the past few
months.

During the day they must be out in the farmlands, searching through
the soils of cultivated areas and consuming vast quantities of
crop-harming insects, and as a natural control improve the lot of our
rural population, by improving the success of good crop yield.

This Monday (17th) just seven were left and it was assumed that the
major flock had departed northwards back to their breeding grounds. We
hope that they have a safe journey, so that they and their progeny
will return to continue their good work for the farmers next year.

Here in East Africa they are popular birds and welcomed by the rural
communitues, to the north of the continent prior to crossing the
Mediterranean many pass through Lebanon. So as our birds head north,
they are equally made welcome by the Lebanese, I urge everyone to tune
in to

and see the festivities as Lebanese welcome our beneficial White
Storks as they in turn pass through their nation.... this was only
yesterday.... share this with all your friends!

Best to all
