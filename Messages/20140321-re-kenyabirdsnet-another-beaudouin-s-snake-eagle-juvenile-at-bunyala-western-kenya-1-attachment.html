  <pre>Hi again Martin,
Could you please just write something up for the rarities committee
with the image. We are at present going through Beaudouin&#39;s records
and it would be great to include yours.
Please send it to Nigel Hunter &lt;nigelhunter@timbale.org&gt;
thanks for that
Brian

&gt; Dear Martin,
&gt; This is a fantastic record, not because it is a Beaudouin&#39;s but
&gt; because it is an immature Beaudouin&#39;s. Two years ago at this exact
&gt; time, I had a dependent juvenile with an adult at Nambale. There were
&gt; two adults in the area, and presumably constituted a pair. The fact
&gt; that a begging young was with one of them meant that it was locally
&gt; bred, and constituted the first time ever in Eastern Africa, and the
&gt; immature the first to be found in Eastern Africa.
&gt; Now your bird is in first plumage, my bird from two years ago has
&gt; probably changed considerably in plumage by now, and I think that this
&gt; is strongly suggestive that Beaudouin&#39;s has bred in the area again.
&gt; Well done for identifying a plumage that is incorrect in most of the
&gt; bird literature,
&gt; Best for now
&gt; Brian

&gt;&gt; This is today&#39;s record. C. beaudouini certainly turning up more
&gt;&gt; frequently
&gt;&gt; than C. pectoralis at Bunyala Rice Scheme, western kenya.
&gt;&gt; (NB: Even my older,-not so old; from 2011- poorer images on closer
&gt;&gt; examination are disappontingly then again excitingly more of beaudouini
&gt;&gt; than pectoralis)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Humble regards
&gt;&gt;
