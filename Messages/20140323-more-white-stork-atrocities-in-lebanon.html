  <pre>Dear All,
Apologies to Itai, but I stole the latest Lebanese White Stork
atrocities off his Facebook.

My point is this, what is the legality that prevents the actual image
of the person committing the crime from being shown in images. Why
does it have to be blurred when the culprit is caught red (bloody)
handed?

It seems wrong to show them a courtousy they don&#39;t deserve.  If the
persons image is shown, and they try to sue for some reason, then this
will bring the horror further out into the limelight.

Best for now

Brian
