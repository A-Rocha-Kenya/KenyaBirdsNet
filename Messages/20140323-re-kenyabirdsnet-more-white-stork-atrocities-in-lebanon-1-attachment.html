  <div dir="ltr"><div>Agreed, but we are dealing with something we have no control over. Presumably the perpetrators ensure their faces are blurred out, or am I wrong? Certainly when you see such atrocities from other countries the perpetrators seem very proud to show their faces.<br>

      <p>Dear All,<br>
Apologies to Itai, but I stole the latest Lebanese White Stork<br>
atrocities off his Facebook.<br>
<br>
My point is this, what is the legality that prevents the actual image<br>
of the person committing the crime from being shown in images. Why<br>
does it have to be blurred when the culprit is caught red (bloody)<br>
handed?<br>
<br>
It seems wrong to show them a courtousy they don&#39;t deserve.  If the<br>
persons image is shown, and they try to sue for some reason, then this<br>
will bring the horror further out into the limelight.<br>
<br>
Best for now<br>
<br>
Brian<br>
