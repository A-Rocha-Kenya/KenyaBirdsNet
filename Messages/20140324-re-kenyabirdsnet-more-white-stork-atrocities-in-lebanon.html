  <pre>Thanks Clive,
I will ask Itai if there are actual faces on the originals, and then
we can make them more famous! There is a Lebanon Hunters web-site
which when I get some time I will go into and see if I can find the
orginal images there,
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Agreed, but we are dealing with something we have no control over.
&gt; Presumably the perpetrators ensure their faces are blurred out, or am I
&gt; wrong? Certainly when you see such atrocities from other countries the
&gt; perpetrators seem very proud to show their faces.

&gt;&gt; Dear All,
&gt;&gt; Apologies to Itai, but I stole the latest Lebanese White Stork
&gt;&gt; atrocities off his Facebook.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; My point is this, what is the legality that prevents the actual image
&gt;&gt; of the person committing the crime from being shown in images. Why
&gt;&gt; does it have to be blurred when the culprit is caught red (bloody)
&gt;&gt; handed?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It seems wrong to show them a courtousy they don&#39;t deserve. If the
&gt;&gt; persons image is shown, and they try to sue for some reason, then this
&gt;&gt; will bring the horror further out into the limelight.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Best for now
&gt;&gt;
