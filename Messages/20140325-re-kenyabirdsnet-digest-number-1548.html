  <pre>Hi,
With just a bit of digging you can fine lots of links, especially for the Lebanon, showing close-up images of many such &#34;atrocities&#34;, they&#39;re all over FaceBook, often with full frontals of the swaggering, proudly erectile, gun-totters and their flash cars.

What pathetic men - not just these bird blasters - what a sad species we are !

&gt; 1. NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 24th March 2014

&gt; 
&gt; NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 24th March 2014
&gt; 
&gt; Dear All,
&gt; With no traffic on the Magadi Road, it was only five minutes to the
&gt; Langata Entrance to Nairobi National Park for Mike Davidson, Heather
&gt; Elkin, Karen Plumbe and myself, having departed from my place.
&gt; Jennifer Oduori came in at Main Gate, and we all met up at 7.00pm.
&gt; 
&gt; On the way from Langata we saw the only Common Buzzard of the day, and
&gt; a flock of at least forty Eurasian Bee-eaters and probably more
&gt; catching emergent insects over the bushes, there having been a light
&gt; shower in the night.
&gt; 
&gt; At the main gate, there was a Grey-headed Kingfisher, which is a
&gt; surprise up here as they are almost all seen along the Mbagathi, also
&gt; an Emerald Cuckoo and an Eastern Honeybird. However our stay at the
&gt; KWS Mess was extremely brief as there was quite obviously nothing to
&gt; see and nothing much heard.
&gt; 
&gt; At Ivory Burning Site things were fairly quiet, with single Olivaceous
&gt; (first of five today) and a Brown Parisoma in the Acacia gerardii.
&gt; Along the causeway at Nagalomon Dam there were single Nightingale,
&gt; Eurasian Reed and a Garden Warbler, whilst the dam was fairly quiet
&gt; with thirty Long-tailed Cormorants, which is a good number for here,
&gt; two Darters,  fifteen Black-crowned Night-Herons and a Green Sandpiper
&gt; in smart streaky breeding plumage.
&gt; 
&gt; We took the back road to the new swamp, a Scaly Francolin feeding
&gt; along the road was the first for some time, but the swamp was more
&gt; interesting with African Water Rails, a beautiful male Painted-snipe,
&gt; a Ruff, fifteen Wood and a Green Sandpiper.
&gt; 
&gt; Retracing to Hyena Dam, we passed a solitary rather small acacia and
&gt; stopped as it had the only Red-backed Shrike of the day in it. Whilst
&gt; we stopped we could see other birds moving amongst the flowers and
&gt; foliage. There was our first of seven Spotted Flycatchers, first of
&gt; just three Willow Warblers, but pride of place went to the first
&gt; Icterine Warbler Nairobi has seen for over ten years. (See images
&gt; attached).
&gt; The dam was not a hive of activity, one of two Eurasian Marsh Harriers
&gt; came by, a Water Rail made a brief appearance, a flock of over
&gt; thirty-five Wood Sandpipers dropped in, there were Banded Martin
&gt; amongst the Barn Swallows present, three Sedge Warblers were in the
&gt; vegetation of which one was most obliging in feeding in an Acacia
&gt; instead of reeds. Proceeding as far as we dare along the side road
&gt; which was still very boggy we found a Red-throated Pipit and the first
&gt; of eleven mainly impressive adult male Whinchats seen today, whilst in
&gt; a tree sat an indifferent immature Martial Eagle.
&gt; 
&gt; Now taking the run-off there were good numbers of Jackson&#39;s
&gt; Widowbirds, including displaying males, and a flock of ten
&gt; Orange-breasted Waxbills which included a few very young olive and
&gt; beige birds.
&gt; 
&gt; At Mbuni Picnic Site the pair of Tawny Eagles have returned to their
&gt; nest to breed, and a Northern Hobby was flying around. At Karen
&gt; Primary School Dam the Crowned Crane was still incubating, and a
&gt; Hartlaub&#39;s Bustard was cowering and hiding well in short grass. Some
&gt; five Yellow-crowned Bishops cavorted in the sedges. Finally three
&gt; Blue-naped Mousebirds were the first for a few weeks. Eland Hollow Dam
&gt; still held on to its African Jacana, a pair of Spotted Thick-knees
&gt; were at their usual spot, a Sedge Warbler sang from the sedges which
&gt; also contained a few more Yellow-crowned Bishops.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the grasslands it was noisy with Cisticolas but not a lot else
&gt; except for a nice male Common Kestrel. Above Athi Basin was our first
&gt; of only two Secretarybirds today, a male Kori Bustard with a female
&gt; seen several kilometres further, and single Pied and Isabelline
&gt; Wheatears. The murrum pits only mustered twenty Vultures which
&gt; included three Ruppell&#39;s and a Lappet-faced. The dam was fairly quiet
&gt; with no surprises, a lone adult Pink-backed Pelican was fishing, still
&gt; fourteen White Storks are preferring the safety of Nairobi than
&gt; risking their lives crossing Lebanon, waders amounted to seven
&gt; Black-winged Stilts, eight Spur-winged, twenty Kittlitz&#39;s and two
&gt; Common Ringed Plovers, fifteen each of Little Stints and Ruffs, five
&gt; Common Sandpipers, with single Marsh Sandpiper and Greenshank. A
&gt; single Speckled Pigeon fed in the weeds. Along the causeway were seven
&gt; roosting Black-crowned Night-Herons, a young Fish Eagle, and a
&gt; Laughing Dove was a nice surprise not easy to see in the Park since
&gt; the illegal excision beyond the Cement Factory. Along that road we
&gt; found a young Eurasian Roller and the only Turkestan Shrike of the
&gt; day. Whilst the Rhino Circuit was so very quiet and hot just rewarding
&gt; us with a Long-crested Eagle and a Common Whitethroat. There was a
&gt; second Common Greenshank at the marshy ox-bow bridge.
&gt; 
&gt; Heading to Kingfisher via the Hippo Pools direct, we had a couple of
&gt; pairs of White-bellied Bustards, single Common Whitethroat and Garden
&gt; Warbler but again it was hot and very quiet. On the burnt area nine
&gt; Black-winged Plover, one pair had two very small chicks, too small to
&gt; have been the chicks from two weeks previous. There was also a very
&gt; nice male Parasitic Weaver on a low bush, a single breeding plumage
&gt; Wattled Starling just more wattle to still grow though, but just as we
&gt; neared Kingfisher the prize of the day was spotted. Nairobi&#39;s first
&gt; ever documented White-throated Bee-eater, a stunning adult (image
&gt; attached). In the old literature the notation of the Nairobi Checklist
&gt; states recorded NNP none since 1972, which means that the record was
&gt; hearsay and they don&#39;t know when it was. It is best to consider this
&gt; the first ever for Nairobi and we have the images as proof!
&gt; 
&gt; At Kingfisher there was a beautiful but well camouflaged Brown Parrot,
&gt; a pair of Long-crested Eagles and the usual pair of Red-throated Tits.
&gt; The nearby swamp held a Saddle-billed Stork and the only Isabelline
&gt; Shrike for the day.
&gt; 
&gt; From here we left for the Main Gate, exiting at 5.30pm and having a
&gt; traffic free return, made the day after such a fantastic birding
&gt; sojourn......perfection!
&gt; 
&gt; Only three Black-shouldered Kites were seen today, Barn Swallows were
&gt; obviously on passage to the south-east and in good numbers though no
&gt; concentrations, and only one Quailfinch was seen.
&gt; 
&gt; Mammals were on the quiet side, most being in Athi Basin, but a lot on
&gt; the burnt area.
&gt; 
&gt; Best to all
&gt; Brian
&gt; 
&gt; KEY TO THE MONTAGE
&gt; 
&gt; ALL ICTERINE WARBLER APART FROM THE WHITE-THROATED BEE-EATER BOTTOM RIGHT.
&gt; 
&gt; Whereas field-guides have limitations showing all of the features of
&gt; Icterine Warbler, all of these images are grabs taken from video of
&gt; todays bird.
&gt; It shows the greenish upperparts and yellowish underparts.
&gt; The pale lore, short supercilium barely extending beyond the eye and
&gt; absence of black superciliary.
&gt; The pale panel on the secondary coverts, caused by the yellowish edging.
&gt; The long primary projection, and even an image showing the wing
&gt; formula of the bird in the field!
&gt; Pale yellow broken eye-ring.
&gt; Bluish-grey legs.
&gt; Short and very pinkish bill.

&gt; 
&gt; Hi
&gt; We did January/ February waterfowl census and finish with little records of lesser flamingos. lots of question on where they are, made us on Friday leave for Lake solai and Sawaiti sawmp to find out. they were not there, just a few lesser &amp; greater flamingos among other species which was fairly represented. there was a dam after place known us kamukunji before reaching lake solai. this dam is a roosting site for many herons, egrets and other birds, here we count up to 104 grey crowned cranes on friday while on their way to the dam for a night. sawaiti on the other site did not give us any flamingo but other birds like ducks, cranes, egrets, plovers and a few warder plenty. both site were great for birds.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards 
&gt; Chesire Dominic

&gt; Thanks Clive,
&gt; I will ask Itai if there are actual faces on the originals, and then
&gt; we can make them more famous! There is a Lebanon Hunters web-site
&gt; which when I get some time I will go into and see if I can find the
&gt; orginal images there,
&gt; Best for now

&gt;&gt; Agreed, but we are dealing with something we have no control over.
&gt;&gt; Presumably the perpetrators ensure their faces are blurred out, or am I
&gt;&gt; wrong? Certainly when you see such atrocities from other countries the
&gt;&gt; perpetrators seem very proud to show their faces.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear All,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Apologies to Itai, but I stole the latest Lebanese White Stork
&gt;&gt;&gt; atrocities off his Facebook.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; My point is this, what is the legality that prevents the actual image
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the person committing the crime from being shown in images. Why
&gt;&gt;&gt; does it have to be blurred when the culprit is caught red (bloody)
&gt;&gt;&gt; handed?
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems wrong to show them a courtousy they don&#39;t deserve. If the
&gt;&gt;&gt; persons image is shown, and they try to sue for some reason, then this
&gt;&gt;&gt; will bring the horror further out into the limelight.
