  <pre>Dear All,
After Fleur and her Wednesday birdwalk to Karen Blixen Museum found a
Golden-tailed Woodpecker two weeks ago, Mike Davidson, Karen Plumbe
and myself went this afternoon and found this very noisy female.

How a Golden-tail with a distribution to the west in the Mara, and the
east at Kibwezi could have found its way to Karen is a mystery, but
there is an image attached from today.

I did not realise it at the time, but the spectacular White-throated
Bee-eater in Nairobi National Park was more than just a stunning gem.
It was my personal 500th species seen in the Park. This just goes to
show what a treasure of avian variety it is.

Finally Prince Charles has spoken out to condemn bird harvesting and
the slaughter of migrants

Best to all
