Dear Otao<br>
I have seen <br>
Cinnamon-chested Bee-eater breed along the Mutubio Climb of Aberdare
National Park <br>
Little Bee-eater go into holes carrying food on the roadside along the
climb to Kisembe Forest in Nairobi National Park, The same carrying food
and entering a hole along the Kichwa Tembo to Mpata Road in Mara just a
few (like 20m) from the said junction<br>
White-fronted Bee-eater at KWS Training Institute, Naivasha along the
Maraingishu River and near Makalia Falls from the back road of Lake
Nakuru Lodge in Lake Nakuru National Park. Also a population of them
nesting at Menengai Crater. I pointed them to Prof. Steve Emlen and it's
the same population he studied in the late 70's.<br><br>
The same day we (Gregory Maina TBA, Anthony Kuria TBA and I)&nbsp; found
Friedmann's Lark nest in Shaba Game Reserve had a Somali Bee-eater twice
pick some fly rub it on the branches and disappear down on the galley
carrying but could dare not walk down as we had had a leopard some 15min
ago and walked through the same galley.&nbsp; I know the exact point if
you interested.<br><br>
That's the little i know for now.<br>
cheers<br>

To all birders<br><br>
In a few weeks a will have some students interested in filming breeding
bee-eaters. I have a few spots that I have seen bee-eaters breeding
specifically Cinnamon-chested Bee-eaters. Has any one while birding
anywhere in Kenya recently seen any breeding clans of any species? any
sightings with specific location would be greatly appreciated.<br><br>
