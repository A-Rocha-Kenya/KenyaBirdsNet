  <pre>Dear All,
I sent this off last Saturday, but although the cc&#39;s arrived, people
have advised me that they have not seen this on the net....

No birding just odd things noticed whilst at home since the big day,
Rupert has additionally had 2 Crowned Cranes and an Olivaceous
Warbler, I have had White-headed Barbet, Black-winged Stilt, Crowned
Eagle, Northern Double-collared Sunbird. Yesterday three
Silvery-cheeked Hornbills came into the garden, and headed off into
IUCN (or over it). The next stop would be NNP on the other side of the
road.... there are no records of this species from NNP!!!!!

Best to all
Brian
