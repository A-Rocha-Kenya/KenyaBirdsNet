  <pre>Dear Mohamed,
Thanks so much for sending this in, and thank you Chris Packham for
taking up the cause, and bringing this horror to public attention.

Everyone in East Africa with resposible outrage should see this and
not turn a blind eye, but take an active role in protesting no matter
how insignificant you feel your voice may be, in trying to bring an
end to these mass murdering nations. Watch Chris Packham&#39;s video, and
see how the people of Malta are themselves sickened by what takes
place,


Best for now
Brian
