<DIV><FONT size=4></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=4>Thanks for the&nbsp;list of species of bird that you consider 
to be 'Endangered' in each East Africa country.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=4></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=4>I would think that you'd want to add to your list all Globally 
Threatened (i.e., <EM>2014 IUCN Red List</EM>) species that are in the 
'Critically Endangered' and 'Endangered' categories...as all of these must 
also&nbsp;be close to extirpation within Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda (e.g., Saker 
Falcon).&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=4></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=4>For Uganda there are a good number of bird species that are 
now confined to limited habitat&nbsp;at but one site.&nbsp; I think that these 
should also be on your list as they must be considered 'Endangered' at the 
Uganda country level.&nbsp;&nbsp;These include, as far as I am aware, 
Fraser's&nbsp;Eagle Owl,&nbsp;Dwarf Honeyguide, African Green Broadbill, 
White-bellied&nbsp;Robin Chat, Grauer's Warbler, Short-tailed Warbler, 
Yellow-eyed Black Flycatcher, and Dusky Twinspot...all known in East Africa 
(Uganda) only from the Bwindi-Impenetrable Forest.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=4></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=4>I noticed that you recently listed the forest birds that are 
now believed to be extirpated from Kenya.&nbsp; It would be useful to have lists 
for ALL birds believed to have been extirpated for Kenya, Tanzania and 
Uganda.&nbsp; This would further highlight the urgency for&nbsp;action 
to&nbsp;present further extirpations&nbsp;of birds from these&nbsp;three 
countries. &nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=4></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=4>Best regards, </FONT></DIV>

  <DIV class=y_msg_container>Dear Neil;&nbsp; Comments re Denham's Bustard 
  brings to mind several <BR>other species that we should all keep in mind as 
  being Endangered. <BR>While Birdlife keep an eye on the Global situation, 
  regionally its <BR>largely up to us to identify species with problems, and I 
  really <BR>think not enough attention is being draw to some birds that are 
  <BR>clearly in bad shape, but which do not qualify for the category of 
  <BR>endangered on a global scale.<BR><BR>I herewith attach a list of species 
  that I consider endangered here <BR>in East Africa. Its in three parts:<BR>16 
  Non-Passerines,&nbsp; 20 Passerines and 3 migrants that spend their 
  <BR>non-breeding season exclusively in EA.<BR>Then three columns for Kenya, 
  Tanzania and Uganda.&nbsp; Endemic species <BR>are in capitals (36% of the 
  total !!)<BR><BR>The line between Critically Endangered (CE) and just 
  Endangered is a <BR>fine one, just as is the line between Vulnerable and Near 
  Threatened. <BR>However the lists for those two lower categories just grows 
  and <BR>grows, so for the time being lets try an concentrate on the 
  <BR>Endangered ones.<BR><BR>Kenya's list is a long one, thirty species, a 
  whopping 77%.&nbsp; with 7 <BR>that are clearly Critical (CE).<BR><BR>I am 
  unclear just how many rank as Endangered in Tanzania, but am <BR>sure its a 
  substantial list too. Please go through it and sometime <BR>let me know what 
  you think and if any others should be added.<BR><BR>Clearly the situation in 
  Tanzania, particularly with vultures is not <BR>so dire as it is here, and 
  that may also be the case for some others, <BR>in fact some may not even 
  qualify for the category of Endangered in <BR>Tanzania, but it does highlight 
  just how many birds here in Kenya are <BR>in really bad shape.<BR><BR>With 
  best wishes<BR>Don<BR><BR><BR>-- <BR><BR></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV>
