&gt; Hello.Hope that everything is well.
&gt; Kindly request if anybody can help to identify this
&gt; partcular species of eagle nesting near the spekes weaver
&gt; birds colony. Found at Nakuru National park last Month.
&gt; Again the relationship among the bird of prey and
&gt; weavers.
&gt; Its among the large big brown eagle but was
&gt; afraid to say Steppe eagle coz of the big gape that extends
&gt; to the back of the eye but i do know that they are paleartic
&gt; migrant.
&gt; Your help will be highly appreciated.
&gt; Warm regards to all and best birding
&gt; times.
