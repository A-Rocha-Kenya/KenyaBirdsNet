<br></span>Does this means that 100s (1000s?) more

feathers for DNA sampling at some stage, as so many other forward-thinking ornithologists already do? <br></span><div><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span>
<br>My query stems from first-hand reports from genuine conservationists working in 
Tanzania who have been appalled to see the many boxes of specimens killed by you, Bowie, Kiure,<i> et al.</i> over the years. How can we ever hope to tackle the devastating bird 
slaughter in Malta and the Middle East while enquiring minds like yours 
are clearing the East African forests of its threatened avifauna? <br><br>Unless you have no objection to the bird slaughter in the Mediterranean, surely this is nothing short of double standards on your part?<br></span><br>

<div><span lang="EN-US">Dear Don, Margaret, Liz, Neil</span></div> 
<div><span lang="EN-US">Flemming Pagh Jensen informed me about an ongoing discussion about the Tanzanian illadopsis. So I checked up with Rauri Bowie what is happening with the DNA data. A phylogeny based on mitochondrial DNA was done MANY years
 ago, but while I completed the morphological work (more than 400 specimens of rufipennis/pyrrhoptera, including 74 from Tanzania), Rauri has apparently prioritized other projects that would be better for his struggle to obtain tenure. Now he got his tenure,
 and has promised me (repeatedly) that he will re-start various projects on Tanzanian forest birds. Yesterday I had a mail from him where he promised to work on this (write up the text for what has been done already and add two nuclear genes for some of the
 samples, to make sure that some oddities in the mtDNA data is not a result of introgression/hybridizationon.
</span></div> 
<div><span lang="EN-US">What can be said so far is that all Tanzanian illadopseses are more closely related to pyrrhoptera than to rufipennis, and that populations are genetically deeply divergent (although with very slight morphological variation,
 suggesting evolutionary stasis in this climatically stable environment). It seems that distans (Usambara, Kanga, Nguru), puguensis (forests near Dar es Salaam and near Rufiji, and Uluguru foothills) and those of Rubeho and Udzungwa (with no name) represent
 three distinct species. So having puguensis raised to species rank may help getting attention to this highly threatened population (but I suspect that further small populations could exist in riparian thickets along Rufiji and up towards Uluguru). Outstanding
 problems: samples from Kiboriani mountains (forest patch above Mpwapwa, which was clearfelled few years ago) group with puguensis, suggesting a small (maybe now extirpated) satellite population of this species, in an unusual (highland) habitat. Further, we
 don’t know where to place the Zanzibar population (documented by two very poorly prepared specimens collected in 1927 and 1933); on my request, Howell and Msuya went there to search for it some years ago, but found nothing … so maybe another extirpated population.
</span></div> 
<div><span lang="EN-US">My text for a paper has been almost ready for publication for some years now … only the text on the genetics lacking … but I hope now that Rauri can speed up so that this can be done within the next couple of months.
