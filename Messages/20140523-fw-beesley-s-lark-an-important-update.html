Despite very poor village leadership, the Beesley's group is doing well. They found 6 nests in March all of which hatched two fledglings and they say the population is increasing. Of course we need to do that total count one of these days as we have talked about for so long. The habitat is in great form with the key short perennial grasses dominating. There's lots to follow up in including local guide training, more binoculars and bird books, and once the village elections are over meetings to help further cement community ownership. But, in the meantime it is very irresponsible for operators and birders to bypass this local initiative which, unfortunately still happens
 quite frequently.<br><br>Would you please send out the attached update on fees and phone contacts.<br><br>Shukran,<br>Daudi<br><a href="mailto:daudi@dorobo.co.tz" ymailto="mailto:daudi@dorobo.co.tz">daudi@dorobo.co.tz</a><br><br><br><br><br><br></div>  </div> </div>  </div> </div></body></html>
