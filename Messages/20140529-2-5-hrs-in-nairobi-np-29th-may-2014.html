<p class="MsoNormal">Dear All,</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This afternoon, 29<sup>th</sup> May 2014, Karen Plumbe and I
paid a brief visit into Nairobi National Park and entered around 3.30pm. We
found Nagalomon Dam to be quiet so made our way to Hyena Dam which turned out
to be superb. We were greeted by a very easy Purple Swamphen and as we first
thought about leaving, a female Little Bittern appeared next to us and we managed
some nice images. African Water Rails were calling and as I tried luring them
in, the male Little Bittern appeared and showed equally well. After he’d left,
the Water Rails finally arrived and we had two show birds very well next to us.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We then headed to a small pond near Langata Gate and found
the Madagascar Pond Heron and Lesser Moorhen, that we’d seen on Monday, to still
be present and we managed some images. As we went around the corner for another
view, we bumped into an immature Martial Eagle with its recently-caught food
item which we later identified as a Tree Hyrax.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Not bad for just a few hours in the ‘City National Park’!</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Cheers for now,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Adam</p>
