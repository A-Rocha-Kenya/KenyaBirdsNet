<DIV><FONT size=4>Thanks for this observation. </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=4></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=4>Although there are a fair number of observations of monkeys 
killing and eating 'vertebrate prey', in no species is this common.&nbsp; In 
fact, primates killing and eating 'vertebrate prey' is only common in 
humans.&nbsp; It is only in humans where more than 1% of the diet is comprised 
of vertebrate prey.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=4></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=4>While many primates (e.g., monkeys, prosimians) eat much 
'animal matter' (perhaps &gt;90% in some species), almost all of this 
is&nbsp;'invertebrate prey'.&nbsp; Humans are the exception.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many 
species of monkeys spend much time seeking invertebrate prey&nbsp;but, it seems, 
few spend any time 'actively seeking/hunting' vertebrate prey (there are some 
exceptions such as baboons seasonally hunting gazelle fawns...and common 
chimpanzees hunting monkeys and duikers...but, at most sites, this is not a 
common activity).&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this,&nbsp;however, when an 
animal-eating&nbsp;monkey does&nbsp;come upon&nbsp;a small vertebrate (e.g. egg, 
galago, bird, rodent,&nbsp;reptile), it will not&nbsp;hesitate to kill and eat 
it...obviously relishing the relatively large prey and, typically, not sharing 
it with other group members.&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=4></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=4>I am not aware of any records of a non-human 
primate&nbsp;eating a prey item that it did not, itself, kill...or&nbsp;which 
was not killed by a group member.&nbsp; Thus, it seems highly likely that the 
monkey with the quail killed that quail (i.e., that quail was not 'scavenged'). 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=4></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=4>I would be interested to receive any records of non-human 
primates killing/eating vertebrate prey from any of the subscribers to the 
kenyabirds and tanzaniabirds sites.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks!</FONT></DIV>

  <P class=MsoNormal>Dear All,</P>
  <P class=MsoNormal><BR></P>
  <P class=MsoNormal>While birding with a group from the rooftop terrace of 
  Serena Mountain Lodge on the afternoon of 12<SUP>th</SUP> May 2014, we found 
  ourselves inundated by the resident white-throated Skye’s Monkeys and they 
  took up positions on the balconies and proceeded to scan the scene. Suddenly, 
  one animal that I was photographing jumped off the balcony and returned about 
  30 seconds later with a bird in its mouth that I could see was a male 
  Harlequin Quail. The bird appeared limp and ‘fresh’ but there was no 
  indication that it was alive. The monkey was bold in its attempts to keep the 
  prey item to itself and proceeded to eat the bird head first.</P>
  <P class=MsoNormal><BR></P>
  <P class=MsoNormal>This observation was noteworthy on two counts; firstly, I 
  would imagine there are few records of this monkey species eating a Harlequin 
  Quail. Secondly, it was a strange location for a Harlequin Quail which I can 
  only suppose was migrating over the forest of Mount Kenya at night and drawn 
  to the bright lights of the lodge. We’ll never know if the bird was already 
  dead or just recuperating after an exhaustive night before it was 
  ‘dispatched’.</P>
  <P class=MsoNormal><BR></P>
  <P class=MsoNormal>Sadly, it was the observation of the quail on our trip!</P>
  <P class=MsoNormal><BR></P>
  <P class=MsoNormal>Cheers for now,</P>
  <P class=MsoNormal>Adam</P></DIV>
