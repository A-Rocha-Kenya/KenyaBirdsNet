  <pre>Dear George,
Your bird certainly looks like a Steppe, but this is really early. I
tried to enlarge your image, to see if it isn&#39;t a Tawny with strange
pale gape feathering, as it seems to go back even further than a
Steppe, but it was not clear enough,
Best for now
Brian

&gt;&gt; Hello.Hope that everything is well.
&gt;&gt; Kindly request if anybody can help to identify this
&gt;&gt; partcular species of eagle nesting near the spekes weaver
&gt;&gt; birds colony. Found at Nakuru National park last Month.
&gt;&gt; Again the relationship among the bird of prey and
&gt;&gt; weavers.
&gt;&gt; Its among the large big brown eagle but was
&gt;&gt; afraid to say Steppe eagle coz of the big gape that extends
&gt;&gt; to the back of the eye but i do know that they are paleartic
&gt;&gt; migrant.
&gt;&gt; Your help will be highly appreciated.
&gt;&gt; Warm regards to all and best birding
&gt;&gt; times.
&gt;&gt; George.
