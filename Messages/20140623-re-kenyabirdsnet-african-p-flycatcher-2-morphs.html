  <pre>Thanks for this James it will be very nice to see the images. But I
wonder where the birds down here are originating from, it&#39;s difficult
to conceive that they would wander down here from Ethiopia, but
stranger things have happened.
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Dear Peter and Brian,
&gt;
&gt; The race ferreti, is common and widespread here in Ethiopia, especially, in
&gt; the SW. I will check through my pics and attach some for your perusal and
&gt; records too.
&gt;
&gt; Happy birding always,

&gt; Dear Peter,
&gt; This is an exciting find, it is the race ferreti. I have only seen the
&gt; bird as you describe twice, and both were in Nairobi NP. They are
&gt; otherwise unreported, and this is the most beautiful of all the
&gt; Paradise Flycatcher forms. Stevenson and Fanshawe do not mention the
&gt; race at all, and have no illustration. Zimmermann &amp; Turner seen to
&gt; have something askew, as they do mention ferreti, and even say it is
&gt; widespread in our region however in the description they mention white
&gt; on the wing, but nothing of that long white tail that you saw. So I
&gt; think it is a bit mixed up in the literature and needs some revision.
&gt; Where exactly are the Kilome Hills?
&gt; Best for now
&gt; Brian

&gt;&gt; Hi Birders!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Over the weekend I was hiking in Kilome hills where I observed
&gt;&gt; one African Paradise Flycatcher with two morphs i.e rufous and white.
&gt;&gt; It looked like the common rufous morph with the glossy black head,blue eye
&gt;&gt; wattle,
&gt;&gt; greyish part below and the mantle was rufous. However the wings and the
&gt;&gt; long
&gt;&gt; tail were
&gt;&gt; all in pure white morph. Unfortunately I did&#39;n carry my camera with me for
&gt;&gt; the photo though.
&gt;&gt; Could it be a resultant of interbreeding and is it confined to a
&gt;&gt; particular
&gt;&gt; region perhaps?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Regards,
&gt;&gt;
