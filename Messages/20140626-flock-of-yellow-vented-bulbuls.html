  <pre>Hi Everyone

Yesterday in the garden in Karen at around 8.00am I counted a flock of 42 yellow vented bulbuls (over a two minute period) all flying in the same direction. They were vocalising excessively as though they were in a frenzy. Unfortunately they didn&#39;t land anywhere in sight.

I have never seen a flock this big together at one time before so was wondering if anyone else had ever witnessed this and if there may be an explanation?
