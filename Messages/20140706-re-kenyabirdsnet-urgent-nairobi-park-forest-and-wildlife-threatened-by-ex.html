<DIV><FONT size=4>"While Kenya has not been a White Rhino range state in the 
last two <BR>hundred years; evidence from fossils and cave paintings in Kenya 
and <BR>northern Tanzania suggests that the White Rhinoceros, presumably similar 
<BR>to the northern race (C. s. cottoni), was widespread and a part of the 
<BR>East African savanna fauna until 3,000 years ago or less (M. Leakey 
<BR>pers. comm.), when it was probably displaced by pastoralists who could 
<BR>easily kill such tame animals (Brett RA [ed] 1993). This is based on the 
<BR>White Rhino subfossil documented by Maeve Leakey from 3,000 year from 
<BR>Rift Valley (Lake Nakuru area). Thus at one stage Kenya was once a White 
<BR>Rhino range state (subspecies unknown) and hence the White Rhino as a 
<BR>species but not C. s. simum as a subspecies has probably been 
<BR>reintroduced to Kenya (with the latter being an introduction of a 
<BR>probable out of range subspecies). A recent report of a white rhino 
<BR>hunting trophy from Kenya in an Austrian Museum still has to be 
<BR>confirmed but merits further investigation."</FONT></DIV>

  <P>Hi Tom,<BR>I believe that the Oribi came from the Krugers Farm at Eldoret 
  some<BR>years ago when the habitat was under threat. Oribi have not been 
  a<BR>native to the area, but of course are found both in the west and 
  the<BR>east where they are common at Kipini on the coast.<BR>At least they are 
  a native Kenyan mammal which cannot be said for White Rhino,<BR>Best for

  Re: [KENYABIRDSNET] URGENT: Nairobi Park forest and wildlife<BR>&gt; 
  threatened by expansion of Orphanage<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; Dear 
  Paula and all,<BR>&gt; This is horrifying, and shows why we have to keep an 
  eye on actions<BR>&gt; taken by KWS in all sorts of their underhand manners, 
  as you said in<BR>&gt; your previous correspondence they are so secretive in 
  what they do. Of<BR>&gt; course what they do is completely illegal, and it's 
  time that the<BR>&gt; conservationist minded public were fully aware of the 
  mishandling of<BR>&gt; Nairobi National Park. It's so difficult nowadays to 
  write anything<BR>&gt; complementary about KWS in Nairobi, but I suppose there 
  must be<BR>&gt; something somewhere.<BR>&gt; From my own standpoint the 
  integrity of Nairobi National Park as a<BR>&gt; reserve for native wildlife 
  was breached when (and I am sure only for<BR>&gt; a tourist attraction) White 
  Rhinos were introduced to the Park. As<BR>&gt; Kenya has never been the home 
  for these beasts, (which I am very fond<BR>&gt; of by the way), they have as 
  little right to call NNP home as House<BR>&gt; Crows in Mombasa, they are an 
  exotic, never native to Kenya and should<BR>&gt; not have been introduced into 
  what up to then was a natural ecosystem<BR>&gt; as far as mammalian species 
  were concerned.<BR>&gt; Had the White Rhinos not had been introduced, we would 
  probably not<BR>&gt; have had the associated problems that we have now, with 
  them being a<BR>&gt; magnet to poachers. They can only bring us trouble and 
  the time is now<BR>&gt; to relocate them in a safe area 
  elsewhere.<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; Do you know that on Sunday, with Fleur and some 
  visitors, we were<BR>&gt; birding along the Cheetah Gate Road. We have always 
  been exceedingly<BR>&gt; suspicious of the great area of land along the 
  Mbagathi in that little<BR>&gt; visited SE corner, being fenced off. Whilst I 
  don't think that<BR>&gt; anything honest from KWS has satisfactorily explained 
  the fencing of<BR>&gt; this portion of the Park, now the road to Cheetah Gate 
  has been<BR>&gt; blocked with the electric fence continuing across the road 
  from the<BR>&gt; Cement Factory. This definitely looks like an Illegal 
  Excision of a<BR>&gt; large part of the Park to me, what do others 
  feel?<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; Then of course there is the mystery fence at the back of 
  Hyena Dam,<BR>&gt; another Excision?, and what about the Pylons????<BR>&gt; 
  Best to all<BR>&gt; Brian<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; On 2/3/14, Paula Kahumbu 
  &lt;pkahumbu@gmail.com&gt; wrote:<BR>&gt;&gt; Dear 
  friends,<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt; I was horrified today to see that KWS have 
  started fencing off a huge<BR>&gt;&gt; piece<BR>&gt;&gt; of the Nairobi 
  National Park for the major expansion of the Nairobi<BR>&gt;&gt; Orphanage. 
  See attached photo. The fence follows the main road from the<BR>&gt;&gt; 
  entrance all the way to the club house - which is almost to the 
  ivory<BR>&gt;&gt; burn<BR>&gt;&gt; site.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt; I am writing 
  to request that you help me to demand an immediate halt<BR>&gt;&gt; 
  these<BR>&gt;&gt; plans. I have identified the following arguments; you may 
  have others<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt; 1. Expanding the orphanage violates the 
  very original purpose of the<BR>&gt;&gt; orphanage - to home orphans and act 
  as a half way house before they are<BR>&gt;&gt; released. The orphanage was 
  never intended as a zoo which is what it<BR>&gt;&gt; seems<BR>&gt;&gt; KWS 
  wants to create. The Safari Walk on the other hand was created as 
  a<BR>&gt;&gt; zoo<BR>&gt;&gt; - there is no need for two zoos in the same 
  place in Nairobi. Moreover,<BR>&gt;&gt; wilderness in the National Park should 
  not be sacrificed for the creation<BR>&gt;&gt; of or expansion of a zoo, 
  instead a wholesome education experience<BR>&gt;&gt; through<BR>&gt;&gt; 
  visitation to the park should be promoted as it is far more 
  valuable.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt; 2. The area for expansion will 
  require the destruction of a sizeable<BR>&gt;&gt; piece<BR>&gt;&gt; of Nairobi 
  Park. We are not aware of any EIA having been conducted, nor<BR>&gt;&gt; are 
  we aware of any stakeholder consultation having taken place. As 
  you<BR>&gt;&gt; know, FoNNaP which is 19 years old, has always defended the 
  park and<BR>&gt;&gt; although our board meets regularly with the warden, there 
  has been no<BR>&gt;&gt; consultation of these plans, and we have not been 
  informed of these or<BR>&gt;&gt; any<BR>&gt;&gt; other plans for developments 
  in the park.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt; 3. We believe that these developments are 
  in violation of the management<BR>&gt;&gt; plan of the park which is already 
  out of date having expired a few years<BR>&gt;&gt; ago. It is also therefore a 
  violation of the new Act which requires parks<BR>&gt;&gt; to have management 
  plans that are developed through a stakeholder<BR>&gt;&gt; consultative 
  process.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt; 4. The area of land that is being fenced off 
  will result in the<BR>&gt;&gt; destruction<BR>&gt;&gt; of highly endangered 
  tropical highland forest including habitats for<BR>&gt;&gt; endangered add 
  endangered species, as well as species of concern<BR>&gt;&gt; 
  including<BR>&gt;&gt; lions, jackals, leopard, Crowned eagle (one of the only 
  2 nesting pairs<BR>&gt;&gt; in<BR>&gt;&gt; Nairobi nests in these trees), 
  Suni, duiker, black rhino and forest hog<BR>&gt;&gt; all<BR>&gt;&gt; live in 
  this part of the forest. I am sure there are also plants, birds<BR>&gt;&gt; 
  and other animals that will also be threatened. By degrading this 
  habitat<BR>&gt;&gt; and alienating it from the park the KWS will be violating 
  the EMCA, and<BR>&gt;&gt; failure to consult the stakeholders is in violation 
  of the constitution.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt; I have written to the Director 
  KWS, NEMA Director and the CS to<BR>&gt;&gt; respectfully request the 
  immediate halt to the ongoing fencing of the<BR>&gt;&gt; park,<BR>&gt;&gt; as 
  it is not too late to restore any damage already 
  caused.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt; I have also asked for an investigation to be 
  initiated into how this<BR>&gt;&gt; proposal was developed and passed without 
  any stakeholder consultation or<BR>&gt;&gt; 
  EIA.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt; Please help by sending your own 
  letter to the Cabinet Secretary, KWS<BR>&gt;&gt; Director (Director@kws.org) 
  and NEMA DG &lt;gmwahungu@gmail.com&gt;on this<BR>&gt;&gt; issue<BR>&gt;&gt; 
  so that they can see how serious this is.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;
