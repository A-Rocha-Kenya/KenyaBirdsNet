  <DIV>This statement from an INFREQUENT&nbsp;VISITOR TO ARUSHA in response to a 
  question abt the bird trade in raptors from Tanzania. Any comments ? the

  <DIV><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>Re live bird export from tZ and Uganda<BR clear=none>I 
  was in tz in Feb and spoke to UK expats in Arusha.<BR clear=none>They are 
  obliged to have a Tanzanian investment certificate to run their small safari 
  business.<BR clear=none>They were surprised to learn that the small print 
  allows them to export birds.<BR clear=none>They have no wish to, but it does 
  seem that the regs are conducive.<BR clear=none>I do not know if all export 
  has ceased.<BR clear=none><FONT size=4><STRONG>Bird selling was a cottage 
  industry in tz until 2009. It was possible to buy peregrines and taitas, from 
  a couple of dealers. The nests were well known.<BR clear=none>You could buy 
  paper bags filled with pygmy falcons, or tawny eagles on the side of the road 
  in Arusha.</STRONG></FONT><BR clear=none>About ten years ago I was surprised 
  to hear that a shipment of martials got to the uae. Some nine birds. Given 
  mortality rates in the 1970s was some 90% and that martials use 90 to 300 
  square km this alone (if adults) removed a fair chuck of any Nations pop. But 
  I guess someone figures out the sustainable harvest despite none knowing 
  it.<BR clear=none>Nb middle east had no interest in the birds. They were on to 
  UK as far as we know.<BR clear=none>All of African eagles are on show at 
  village church fetes this days. (Though I suspect Cameroon Senegal and Niger 
  as major contributors)<BR clear=none>Back then Munir and I heard of massive 
  breeding centres in Uganda where mArtials among many other raptors were being 
  bred. Evidently all above board. Pity these skills Are not used for restoring 
  condors and Philippine eagles I thought.<BR clear=none>We asked for info in tz 
  and Uganda. Asked TRAFFIC too. But we had a resounding silence.<BR 
  clear=none>The whole matter is conducted with confidentiality between all 
  parties. While CITES and TRAFFIC may occasionally cooperate with figures it is 
  seldom prior to the export. Usually the request&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and outcome 
  is between client and governments.<BR clear=none>A global network of private 
  concerned people may get on top of it by cross referencing what they see. But 
  cites and traffic have got to take the lead and step out of the confines of 
  bureaucracy into the field.<BR clear=none>Of course any investigation will 
  backlash on legitimate areas in conservation. Export of samples for pesticides 
  or DNA or medical care or legit captive breeding is hammered and stifled most 
  successfully whereas export of adult eagles to church fetes (if the presence 
  of african eagles in uk, europe, thailand is and indication )continues.<BR
