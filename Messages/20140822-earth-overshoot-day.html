  target=_blank>Earth Overshoot Day</A><U>&nbsp;2014, the approximate date 
  humanity’s annual demand on nature exceeds what the Earth can renew this year. 
  In less than 8 months, we have demanded an amount of ecological resources and 
  services&nbsp;equivalent to what Earth can regenerate for all of 
  2014.&nbsp;<BR><BR>On Earth Overshoot Day, humanity has exhausted nature’s 
  budget for the year. For the rest of the year, we are drawing down our 
  ecological assets. Ecological deficit spending is made possible by depleting 
  stocks of fish, trees and other resources, and accumulating waste such as 
  carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and oceans. Currently, the carbon Footprint 
  is the largest portion of humanity’s Footprint -- a result of emitting 
  greenhouse gases faster than they can be absorbed by forests and oceans -- and 
  contributes significantly to humanity’s ecological 
  overspending.<BR><BR>According to Global Footprint Network’s calculations, it 
  would take more than 1.5 Earths to provide the biocapacity needed to 
  support&nbsp;humanity’s current Ecological&nbsp;Footprint. Moderate 
  population, energy and food projections suggest that humanity would require 
  the biocapacity of three planets well before mid-century. This may be 
  physically unfeasible.<BR><BR>Today, 86 percent of the world population lives 
  in countries that demand more from nature than their own ecosystems can renew. 
  These “ecological debtor” countries either deplete their own ecological 
  resources or get them from elsewhere. Were Japan’s residents to consume 
  ecological resources and services solely from within their country’s borders, 
  they would demand 7 Japans. In other words, Japan’s Footprint is 7 times 
  larger than its biocapacity. Similarly, it would take 4.3 Switzerlands to 
  support Switzerland and 2.7 Egypts to support Egypt.<BR><BR>Not all countries 
  demand more than their ecosystems can provide, but even the reserves of such 
  “ecological creditor” nations like Brazil, Indonesia, and Sweden are shrinking 
  over time. For these countries, the main challenge is to treat their natural 
  assets as ever-more significant sources of wealth to be preserved and nurtured 
  over the long term, as opposed to riches to be squandered for short-term 
  profits.<BR></U></DIV>
  <DIV><U><BR></U></DIV>
  <DIV><U>It is possible to turn the tide. Global Footprint Network and its 
  partners are supporting governments, financial institutions, and other 
  organizations around the globe in making decisions aligned with ecological 
  reality.<BR><BR>Earth Overshoot Day is a valuable opportunity to raise 
  awareness about humanity’s ecological resource overuse. Please help us promote 
  Earth Overshoot Day on your website, in your newsletters, with friends, and on 
  your social media channels, using the hashtag #oShoot and our Twitter

  <H2><U>Solomons town first in Pacific to relocate due to climate change

  target=_blank>http://planetark.org/wen/72068</A><BR></P><U>Under threat from 
  rising sea levels and tsunamis, the authorities of a provincial capital in the 
  Solomon Islands have decided to relocate from a small island in the first such 
  case in the Pacific islands. </U>
  <P><U>Choiseul, a township of around 1,000 people on Taro Island, a coral 
  atoll in Choiseul Bay, is less than two meters (6.6 feet) above sea level. Its 
  vulnerability to storm surges and tsunamis caused by earthquakes is expected 
  to be compounded in the future by rising seas.</U></P>
  <P><U>Aware of these risks, communities in Choiseul Bay consulted a team of 
  engineers, scientists and planners, funded by the Australian government, on 
  how best to adapt to the impact of climate change.</U></P>
  <P><U>It was decided they would take disaster prevention measures in the short 
  term but also build a new town on an adjacent mainland where the population 
  will be moved in stages.</U></P>
  <P><U>"The project followed the ways of our traditions - talking with people, 
  listening to people and reflecting the desires of the people," Jackson Kiloe, 
  premier of Choiseul Province, said in a statement on Friday.</U></P>
  <P><U>Philip Haines, project manager for BMT WBM, an international consultancy 
  that worked on the strategy, said relocation was the only option that would 
  keep the community safe but it would take "many decades" to complete.</U></P>
  <P><U>Land to build a new, larger settlement catering for some 5,000 
  inhabitants has already been acquired, Haines said.</U></P>
  <P><U>Essential infrastructure such as a hospital and secondary school will 
  likely be built in the next five years, he said, adding that everything from 
  roads to government buildings and a hydropower system must be constructed 
  because the land is a greenfield site.</U></P>
  <P><U>"Basically it's a town from absolute scratch," Haines told the Thomson 
  Reuters Foundation by phone from Australia. "So we need to do it well and 
  build it to last for many generations to come."</U></P>
  <P><U>INTERNATIONAL FUNDING?</U></P>
  <P><U>Haines declined to give a price tag for the project, but said it would 
  run to many hundreds of millions of Australian dollars. The Solomon Islands 
  government would be looking for climate change funding from international 
  donors to finance the relocation, he added.</U></P>
  <P><U>On a brief visit to the Solomon Islands this week, U.S. Secretary of 
  State John Kerry said the Pacific Island nation stands to benefit from U.S. 
  funding for programs to deal with the effects of climate change in the 
  Asia-Pacific region.</U></P>
  <P><U>The United States deployed troops and contributed $250,000 to help deal 
  with the last big disaster in the Solomon Islands - Cyclone Ita which struck 
  in April. The tropical storm caused widespread flooding, killed at least 23 
  people and affected another 50,000.</U></P>
  <P><U>The groups behind the Choiseul adaptation plan said it is being hailed 
  by the Solomon Islands national government as a model for other provinces 
  across the nation and more broadly across the Pacific.</U></P>
  <P><U>The threat posed by climate change has promoted other relocation 
  initiatives in the region.</U></P>
  <P><U>The Kiribati government, which sees relocation as an option of last 
  resort, is pursuing a policy it calls "migration with dignity".</U></P>
  <P><U>It plans to help establish expatriate communities that can absorb and 
  support more Kiribati migrants in future, while</U></P>
  <P><U>Elsewhere, some 2,000 people are being permanently resettled from the 
  tiny, low-lying islet of Han in the Carteret Atoll of Papua New Guinea to 
  mainland Bougainville, a three-hour ride on a wooden boat, due to salt 
  intrusion and king tides eroding shores and making farming difficult.</U></P>
  <P><U>But the Choiseul project is the first time that a provincial capital 
  with all its services and facilities will be relocated in the Pacific Islands, 
  the planners said.</U></P>
  <P><U>Haines said locals are keen to move as quickly as possible due to the 
  risks they face, noting they may be less attached to their home than other 
  communities because the township on Taro Island only became well-established 
  after World War Two.</U></P>
