  <div dir="ltr">Dear Friends,<div><br></div><div>World Elephant Day celebrated on 9th August in Nairobi was not just a celebration, it was a day of action for elephants here in Kenya. Nearly 400 people signed a letter to the Inspector General of the Police asking for the arrest of wanted suspected ivory kingpin, Feizal Ali Mohamed.</div>
<div><br></div><div>Please find attached our report on the day. For those who attended THANK YOU!  </div><div><br></div><div>For those who couldn&#39;t make it, enjoy the pictures and we hope you will support our ongoing work.  </div>
<div><br></div><div>We are now planning for<b> the Global March for Elephants and Rhinos</b> which takes place internationally on 4th October. We will do our march in Nairobi and will use the day to mourn the more than 120,000 elephants that have been slaughtered across Africa in the last 4 years, and as a platform to engage the youth in a song competition <b>NDOVU MUSIC</b>  in praise of elephants (NdovuMusic.com). </div>
<div><br></div><div>To engage the youth, Wildlife Direct in partnership with the Kenya National Debate Council is launching a series of national debates on wildlife dubbed <b>WILDLIFE DUELS </b>in High Schools and universities across 15 wildlife rich counties. </div>
<div> </div><div>Please do let me know if you would like to join us in creating awareness, understanding, involvement and change to save elephants in Kenya. </div><div><br></div><div>Kind Regards</div><div>Paula</div><div>
