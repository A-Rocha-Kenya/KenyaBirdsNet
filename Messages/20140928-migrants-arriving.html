  <pre>Greetings birders

Last Sunday 21 September at a dam northeast of Thika, Nature Kenya&#39;s Sunday
Birdwatch outing recorded several migrants from the north:

Common Ringed Plover
Common Sandpiper
Little Stint
Curlew Sandpiper
Eurasian Bee-eater
Barn Swallow

And a wonderful variety of local birds, including Great White Pelican and
Pink-backed Pelican.

There were a couple of brown, dark-billed immature Great White Pelicans, and
birders who had taken part in the Waterbird Counts confirmed that the
pelicans are breeding again on the islands in Lake Elmenteita.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
