  Dear birding friends,<br><br>I hope some of us are aware of the Kenya Bird Map: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://kenyabirdmap.adu.org.za/index.php">http://kenyabirdmap.adu.org.za/index.php</a><br>which is a web-based birds database of Kenya. <br>This is aimed at revising the first bird atlas for Kenya, which was published in 1989. It used data collected from the 1970s to 1984.<br>Since it is about 30 years later, much has changed to the Kenyan habitats and birds&#39; distribution has changed. New Kenyan species are being recorded e.g. Rufous-tailed Weaver and Karamoja Apalis; while some birds are getting very rare to find e.g. Egyptian Vulture and Denham&#39;s Bustard; even others are really being broadly distributed e.g. House Sparrow and House Crow. Much of these changes are undocumented. We thus need a new updated atlas for Kenyan birds.<br>The approach is simple, the atlas is using citizen science (birders visit regions of Kenya and list all the birds seen there. These records are then submitted to the website and shared to the public, as a bird atlas.)<br><br>To join the atlas, kindly write an email to kenyabirdmap@naturekenya.org and request to be registered. <br>Kindly see our <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://kenyabirdmap.adu.org.za/index.php">website</a> on: how to atlas and how to submit data.<br><br>Kindly let us take part in this worthy course and help tell the story of our birds. Encourage your birding friends to join us and map birds in Kenya.<br>Kenyan birds need you and me....happy birding to you all<br><br>Kind regards,<br>Washington Wachira.<br><br><p><span><br class="yui-cursor"></span></p>
