It’s a fascinating discussion on the differences as to how our eyes<br>
perceive structural colour as opposed to “real” colour.<br>
I had to wait until it was suggested that the effect of your birds,<br>
was due to change of angle on a structural colour, before replying.<br>
For years I have been seeing the odd rueppelli with the rich blue<br>
speculum amongst our normal green speculum nominate. Officially there<br>
is no conclusive proof that rueppelli has occurred in Kenya.<br>
Your eyes are not playing tricks on you, the colour is being perceived<br>
as real and not just structural or illusory.<br>
A month or so ago, I took a video of a Yellow-billed Duck at Naivasha.<br>
It showed the rueppelli character of attractive blue speculum, and was<br>
associating with nominate green birds.<br>
I wanted to show that the perception of this colour was not due to<br>
angle reflecting off structure, and rueppelli were visiting us<br>
regularly even though it is not acknowledged.<br>
I edged closer to the bird and waited until it got nervous and took<br>
off. It flew past me, I videoed the bird as it covered 120o or so<br>
before alighting again. As I videoed the bird not only was I getting<br>
the angle changing as it flew past me, but also the angle of the wings<br>
changed dramatically with each beat. What more could I want?<br>
Now look at the images attached for the changes from blue to green!<br>
Best for now<br>
