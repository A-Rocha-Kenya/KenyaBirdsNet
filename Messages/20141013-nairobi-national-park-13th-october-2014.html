  <pre>NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 13th October 2014

Dear All,
Heather Elkin, Fleur Ng’Weno, Jennifer Oduori and myself met up at
Langata Gate at 6.30am on 13th October. The lady at the gate expertly
processed our cards, and we were in the Park in no time.
It was a cloudy start, such a pity as both the mornings on the weekend
had been beautiful, bright and clear. There had been no rain for
twelve days, and the signs of drying were rife.
We did a circuit through the glade first, we had over fifteen Sunis,
but the best mammal we did not see. Stopping for a flock of
Violet-backed Starlings containing one male Eurasian Golden Oriole,
(an amazing colour combination!), seemingly not far away a Leopard
proceeded to very loudly give its “sawing wood” call. A very well
marked Great Sparrowhawk had chosen a prominent perch, and we saw our
first of four Eurasian Buzzards seen today, the first of four separate
sightings of Martial Eagles (all adults), and first of five Spotted
Flycatchers.

The Langata Dam had nothing on it, but the Forest Edge Pond had a pair
of Crowned Cranes (three pairs seen today), a Little Grebe, three
Red-billed Teal and a couple of Green Sandpipers. Nagalomon Dam was
very quiet along the edge although there was a Red-knobbed Coot and an
African Water Rail. A young Fish Eagle sat on the tree on the “island”
and there was only one Darter present. Through the reeds on the sandy
spit were an adult and immature Black-winged Stilts, whilst an unseen
Little Bittern barked from cover. The pair of Spotted Thick-knees was
on the Drift, and Pied Crows were mobbing something that was probably
a Booted Eagle but it disappeared before any positive identification.

Ivory Burning Site was not very active, producing more Violet-backed
Starlings but a surprise were ten African Silverbills flying over. Not
something you associate with highland forest edge!

Taking the back road there were a nice pair of Nairobi Pipits, and the
seasons first Garden Warbler which was singing softly but cheerfully.
Wattled and Violet-backed Starlings were coming in to the stream to
drink, and with them were three very attractive Grey-headed
Silverbills, and a solitary Red-billed Quelea in breeding plumage.
There was a Red-faced Cisticola singing here as well. At the swamp,
now reduced to a thin rivulet, with much drying up of the sedge beds,
we found a few Wood and a couple of Green Sandpipers, six Eurasian
Bee-eaters (seen in a number of places, but no large flocks), and the
only Yellow Wagtail of the day (lutea). There were a few Red-collared
Widowbirds with some in breeding plumage, and White-winged Widowbirds
that were not.

Retracing around to Hyena Dam we had our morning coffee with three of
the tamest Glossy Ibis imaginable. There were also a Little Egret,
immature Purple Heron, twenty or more Wood Sandpipers, but no sign of
long stayers like Swamphens, Long-toed Plovers, African Jacana or
Greater Paintedsnipe.

On the run-off were two Secretarybirds, a Great Egret, and a few
Banded Martins and Jackson’s Widowbirds.

Stopping off at Mbuni Picnic Site we found another male Eurasian
Golden Oriole, and near there the first of three White-bellied
Bustards, and a male Hartlaub’s Bustard displaying beautifully and
giving out his long groan. We found an immature Black-shouldered Kite
resting on a bush, very scaly upperparts. A Tawny Eagle attacked it
and pursued it with every intention of eating it, until a parent came
in and dived at the Eagle who was soon driven off. A Bateleur flew
over, and there were many Barn Swallows feeding over the plains, they
were mixed in with Red-rumped Swallows, Banded Martins, Little and one
Mottled Swift, but as expected today, no Lesser Striped Swallows were
recorded. Our first two Northern Wheatears were also here, the only
other bird being one on the burnt ground near Kingfisher. Fifty or
more Wattled Starlings were in the cluster of acacias, squeaking and
gurgling, some males in breeding plumage, and a Fan-tailed Grassbird
called from cover out on the plain.

At the murrum pits it was evidently early for most of the vultures to
come and bathe, but there were six White-backs with an impressive
Lappet-faced. The pool had a gathering of birds with a Yellow-billed
Stork, a couple of Red-billed Teal and a pair of Black-winged Stilts.
There was also a single Kittlitz’s Plover, whilst resident in good
numbers at Athi Dam, this I believe was the first time I had seen the
bird in the Park away from Athi dam! In the Athi Basin were three more
Secretarybirds flying together.

At Athi Dam, as expected the Skimmer had not stayed, there were a few
each of Yellow-billed Stork and African Spoonbills, fifteen
White-faced Whistling-Ducks, just one Black-winged Stilt, eight
Spur-winged and thirteen Kittlitz’s Plovers, five Little Stints, two
Common Greenshank and a lone Common Sandpiper. Four Black-crowned
Night-Herons roosted on the causeway.

A look along the Rhino Circuit rewarded us with ten White
Helmet-shrikes, presumably there were ten back on the 4th, and we
missed one. Further along the riverine was a female Eurasian Golden
Oriole. Now we were heading back towards Langata Gate, and on the way
to Kingfisher had pairs each of Pangani Longclaw and Long-billed
Pipits. Near Kingfisher was an adult Black Stork and the nearby pond
had an African Water Rail feeding where buffalo had trampled the
Typha.

The last birds before we left at 4.30pm were a Common Greenshank with
five Green Sandpipers on Forest Edge Pond, and another Great Egret at
Langata Dam with two Green Pigeons enjoying the late afternoon
sunshine.

It was a great day, not as many new arrivals as hoped for, but
migrants are trickling through. Plains game were in very impressive
numbers from Karen Primary School Dam all the way to Athi Basin. This
included between 2-300 Wildebeest and a similar number of Eland.

Best for now
Brian
