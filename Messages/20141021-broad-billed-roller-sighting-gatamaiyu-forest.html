  <hr/>
  Dear all,<br><br>This past Sunday-19th October 2014, the Sunday Birdwatch team was at Gatamaiyu forest. The birding was great with some great sightings. On the migrants list was the Eurasian Bee-eaters, only. On our way back, however, we saw some more at Manguo ponds- including Yellow Wagtails.<br>The day&#39;s list was graced by gorgeous displays from Bar-tailed Trogons, Black-fronted Bush-shrikes, Brown-capped Weavers and Fine-banded Woodpeckers. <br>The highlight of the day, however, were 3 Broad-billed Rollers seen at the edge of the forest. This was my first sighting of the bird near the Aberdare forest ecosystem, after sightings in Meru National Park (open woodland habitat). A local guide also stated that this was his first sighting of the bird there.<br>This comes after Brian Finch also sighted the bird recently in Nairobi National Park.<br>Could the birds be moving somewhere, and maybe using the larger Nairobi area as a passage route/stop-over?<br><br>The entire list for the day will be uploaded on the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://kenyabirdmap.adu.org.za/index.php">Kenya Bird Map website</a> soon.<br><br>Happy birding.<br><p><span><br class="yui-cursor"></span></p>
