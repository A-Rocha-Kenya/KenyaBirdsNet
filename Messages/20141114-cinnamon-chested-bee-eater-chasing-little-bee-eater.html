  <pre>Greetings birders

Cinnamon-chested Bee-eaters and Little Bee-eaters are normally separated by
habitat. One place where they meet is Uhuru Gardens National Monument in
Nairobi, where Cinnamon-chested Bee-eaters often visit the tall trees of the
acacia woodland, while Little Bee-eaters are resident in the bushed
grassland.

On Nature Kenya&#39;s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk to Uhuru Gardens on 12
November, we watched as they contested a space between their two habitats Â­
a frail Sesbania tree in the reedy wetland. Each species perched on the
Sesbania, and finally, the much larger Cinnamon-chested Bee-eater chased off
the Little one.

Other notable sightings were Spotted Palm (Morning) Thrush feeding young in
its mud-based nest, Brown Parisoma at its nest, and a gorgeous Black
Cuckooshrike with yellow shoulders and bright orange gape. Black
Cuckooshrikes have been abundant this year, seen on nearly every Wednesday
birdwalk since July, many of them with yellow shoulders

Northern migrants included Barn Swallow, Spotted Flycatcher and Willow
Warbler. We recorded over 65 species for the morning.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
