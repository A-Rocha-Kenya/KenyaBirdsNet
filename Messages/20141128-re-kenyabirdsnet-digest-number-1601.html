  <pre>As far as I can remember, some ringers caught almost a similar number
or more from the same mist net in c.2005-6, most of them coming in
small flocks between 8 and 11am. This was in Karen near the police
stn. I can get exact figures, times and dates if helpful.

&gt; Hi Everyone
&gt;
&gt; Yesterday in the garden in Karen at around 8.00am I counted a flock of 42
&gt; yellow vented bulbuls (over a two minute period) all flying in the same
&gt; direction. They were vocalising excessively as though they were in a frenzy.
&gt; Unfortunately they didn&#39;t land anywhere in sight.
&gt;
&gt; I have never seen a flock this big together at one time before so was
&gt; wondering if anyone else had ever witnessed this and if there may be an
&gt; explanation?
