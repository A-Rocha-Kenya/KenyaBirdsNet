&gt;&gt; Good news, the NEMA boss just called me to tell me that after an
&gt;&gt; inspection they issued a stop order as no
&gt;&gt; EIA or stakeholder consultation has taken place. Hopefully this is a new
&gt;&gt; opportunity to engage with and
&gt;&gt; support KWS in improvements - afterall we are their customers and the
&gt;&gt; rightful owners of the park.

&gt;&gt;     &#34;While Kenya has not been a White Rhino range state in the last two
&gt;&gt;     hundred years; evidence from fossils and cave paintings in Kenya and
&gt;&gt;     northern Tanzania suggests that the White Rhinoceros, presumably
&gt;&gt;     similar
&gt;&gt;     to the northern race (C. s. cottoni), was widespread and a part of the
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     East African savanna fauna until 3,000 years ago or less (M. Leakey
&gt;&gt;     pers. comm.), when it was probably displaced by pastoralists who could
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     easily kill such tame animals (Brett RA [ed] 1993). This is based on
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;     White Rhino subfossil documented by Maeve Leakey from 3,000 year
&gt;&gt;     from
&gt;&gt;     Rift Valley (Lake Nakuru area). Thus at one stage Kenya was once a
&gt;&gt;     White
&gt;&gt;     Rhino range state (subspecies unknown) and hence the White Rhino as
&gt;&gt;     a
&gt;&gt;     species but not C. s. simum as a subspecies has probably been
&gt;&gt;     reintroduced to Kenya (with the latter being an introduction of a
&gt;&gt;     probable out of range subspecies). A recent report of a white rhino
&gt;&gt;     hunting trophy from Kenya in an Austrian Museum still has to be
&gt;&gt;     confirmed but merits further investigation.&#34;

&gt;&gt; Hi Tom,
&gt;&gt; I believe that the Oribi came from the Krugers Farm at Eldoret some
&gt;&gt; years ago when the habitat was under threat. Oribi have not been a
&gt;&gt; native to the area, but of course are found both in the west and the
&gt;&gt; east where they are common at Kipini on the coast.
&gt;&gt; At least they are a native Kenyan mammal which cannot be said for
&gt;&gt; White Rhino,

&gt;&gt; &gt; Are Oribi Ourebia ourebi also an &#39;introduced species&#39; to Nairobi
&gt;&gt; National
&gt;&gt; &gt; Park? I thought that this species was brought into NNP from SW
&gt;&gt; Kenya (i.e.,
&gt;&gt; &gt; O. o. cottoni).
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I am not aware of any earlier records of Oribi for the Nairobi area.
&gt;&gt; Are
&gt;&gt; &gt; there any such records?

&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Paula and all,
&gt;&gt; &gt; This is horrifying, and shows why we have to keep an eye on
&gt;&gt; actions
&gt;&gt; &gt; taken by KWS in all sorts of their underhand manners, as you said
&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt; &gt; your previous correspondence they are so secretive in what they
&gt;&gt; do. Of
&gt;&gt; &gt; course what they do is completely illegal, and it&#39;s time that the
&gt;&gt; &gt; conservationist minded public were fully aware of the mishandling
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt; &gt; Nairobi National Park. It&#39;s so difficult nowadays to write anything
&gt;&gt; &gt; complementary about KWS in Nairobi, but I suppose there must be
&gt;&gt; &gt; something somewhere.
&gt;&gt; &gt; From my own standpoint the integrity of Nairobi National Park as a
&gt;&gt; &gt; reserve for native wildlife was breached when (and I am sure only
&gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt; &gt; a tourist attraction) White Rhinos were introduced to the Park. As
&gt;&gt; &gt; Kenya has never been the home for these beasts, (which I am very
&gt;&gt; fond
&gt;&gt; &gt; of by the way), they have as little right to call NNP home as House
&gt;&gt; &gt; Crows in Mombasa, they are an exotic, never native to Kenya and
&gt;&gt; should
&gt;&gt; &gt; not have been introduced into what up to then was a natural
&gt;&gt; ecosystem
&gt;&gt; &gt; as far as mammalian species were concerned.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Had the White Rhinos not had been introduced, we would probably
&gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt; &gt; have had the associated problems that we have now, with them
&gt;&gt; being a
&gt;&gt; &gt; magnet to poachers. They can only bring us trouble and the time is
&gt;&gt; now
&gt;&gt; &gt; to relocate them in a safe area elsewhere.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Do you know that on Sunday, with Fleur and some visitors, we
&gt;&gt; were
&gt;&gt; &gt; birding along the Cheetah Gate Road. We have always been
&gt;&gt; exceedingly
&gt;&gt; &gt; suspicious of the great area of land along the Mbagathi in that little
&gt;&gt; &gt; visited SE corner, being fenced off. Whilst I don&#39;t think that
&gt;&gt; &gt; anything honest from KWS has satisfactorily explained the fencing
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt; &gt; this portion of the Park, now the road to Cheetah Gate has been
&gt;&gt; &gt; blocked with the electric fence continuing across the road from the
&gt;&gt; &gt; Cement Factory. This definitely looks like an Illegal Excision of a
&gt;&gt; &gt; large part of the Park to me, what do others feel?
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Then of course there is the mystery fence at the back of Hyena
&gt;&gt; Dam,
&gt;&gt; &gt; another Excision?, and what about the Pylons????

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Dear friends,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I was horrified today to see that KWS have started fencing off a
&gt;&gt; huge
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; piece
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of the Nairobi National Park for the major expansion of the Nairobi
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Orphanage. See attached photo. The fence follows the main road
&gt;&gt; from the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; entrance all the way to the club house - which is almost to the
&gt;&gt; ivory
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; burn
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; site.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I am writing to request that you help me to demand an immediate
&gt;&gt; halt
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; these
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; plans. I have identified the following arguments; you may have
&gt;&gt; others
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 1. Expanding the orphanage violates the very original purpose of
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; orphanage - to home orphans and act as a half way house before
&gt;&gt; they are
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; released. The orphanage was never intended as a zoo which is
&gt;&gt; what it
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; seems
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; KWS wants to create. The Safari Walk on the other hand was
&gt;&gt; created as a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; zoo
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; - there is no need for two zoos in the same place in Nairobi.
&gt;&gt; Moreover,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; wilderness in the National Park should not be sacrificed for the
&gt;&gt; creation
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of or expansion of a zoo, instead a wholesome education
&gt;&gt; experience
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; through
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; visitation to the park should be promoted as it is far more
&gt;&gt; valuable.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 2. The area for expansion will require the destruction of a sizeable
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; piece
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of Nairobi Park. We are not aware of any EIA having been
&gt;&gt; conducted, nor
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; are we aware of any stakeholder consultation having taken place.
&gt;&gt; As you
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; know, FoNNaP which is 19 years old, has always defended the
&gt;&gt; park and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; although our board meets regularly with the warden, there has
&gt;&gt; been no
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; consultation of these plans, and we have not been informed of
&gt;&gt; these or
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; any
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; other plans for developments in the park.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 3. We believe that these developments are in violation of the
&gt;&gt; management
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; plan of the park which is already out of date having expired a few
&gt;&gt; years
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ago. It is also therefore a violation of the new Act which requires
&gt;&gt; parks
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to have management plans that are developed through a
&gt;&gt; stakeholder
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; consultative process.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 4. The area of land that is being fenced off will result in the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; destruction
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of highly endangered tropical highland forest including habitats for
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; endangered add endangered species, as well as species of
&gt;&gt; concern
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; including
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; lions, jackals, leopard, Crowned eagle (one of the only 2 nesting
&gt;&gt; pairs
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Nairobi nests in these trees), Suni, duiker, black rhino and forest
&gt;&gt; hog
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; all
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; live in this part of the forest. I am sure there are also plants,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; birds
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and other animals that will also be threatened. By degrading this
&gt;&gt; habitat
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and alienating it from the park the KWS will be violating the
&gt;&gt; EMCA, and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; failure to consult the stakeholders is in violation of the
&gt;&gt; constitution.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I have written to the Director KWS, NEMA Director and the CS to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; respectfully request the immediate halt to the ongoing fencing of
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; park,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; as it is not too late to restore any damage already caused.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I have also asked for an investigation to be initiated into how this
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; proposal was developed and passed without any stakeholder
&gt;&gt; consultation or
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; EIA.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Please help by sending your own letter to the Cabinet Secretary,
&gt;&gt; KWS
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Director (Director@kws.org) and NEMA DG
&gt;&gt; &lt;gmwahungu@gmail.com&gt;on this
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; issue
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; so that they can see how serious this is.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
