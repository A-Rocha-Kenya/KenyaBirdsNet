Dear all,

While working on Guineafowls on Mpala Ranch in Laikipia, We captured two
Spotted Flycatchers in the same mist net. With careful look we realized that
one had a ring on its leg. It was a German Ring Number 9N04470, Helgoland,
Germany. After releasing the birds, they remained in the same area the rest
of the day, and captured 3 times in the day.  The fact that it is March and
migrants are expected back in Europe in a few weeks time, both the birds had
hardly enough fat deposits ready to head back home. GPS reading, UTM, 26 25
18,  43 0 47 156 Â€ South. at an altitude of 1695 m above sea level.

Kind regards,

Titus
