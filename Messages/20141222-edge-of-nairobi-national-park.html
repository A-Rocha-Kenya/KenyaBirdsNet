Nature Kenya's Sunday Birdwatch spent a delightful day in Silole Sanctuary near Masai Lodge just outside Nairobi National Park on December 21. Highlights included:<BR>

</SPAN></FONT><UL><LI><FONT FACE="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><SPAN STYLE='font-size:12pt'>A Red-and-yellow Barbet and a pair of Red-fronted Barbets repeatedly entering the nests of Grey-capped Social Weavers. We wondered if they were looking for eggs or chicks to eat?

</SPAN></FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><SPAN STYLE='font-size:12pt'>Migrants including Willow Warbler, Spotted Flycatcher and Yellow Wagtail<BR>

On December 19, an afternoon visit to Nairobi National Park found Black-winged Plovers with a fluffy chick on the short grass near Kingfisher Picnic site, and migrants such as Eurasian Bee-eater, Northern and Isabelline Wheatears and a Whinchat in fine plumage.<BR>
