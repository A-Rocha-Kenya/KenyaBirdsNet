<p class="MsoNormal">Dear All,</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">While birding at Lake Baringo on 17<sup>th</sup> May 2014, Francis
Cherutich, four guests and I left the wharf at Soi Lodge at 6.30am for a boat
trip. Within a few minutes of our departure in a northern direction, I was
amazed to see two Ospreys circling overhead with one bird calling vociferously.
It held its position in the air with vigorous wingbeats and held a fish in its right
talon. The second bird circled around nearby but did not reply with calls. This
went on for 15-20 minutes.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Local guide Francis had not noted the behaviour at this site
before and, having observed similar behaviour at breeding sites in Scotland, the birds gave me the impression that
they might consider breeding at this site which I gather would be a first for
Kenya and possibly the region.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Further reports of the species from this site will be
gratefully received.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Cheers for now,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Adam</p>
