  <pre>I was in the Masai Mara from Oct 1st to 5th with a none birding group
visiting both Trans Mara and Narok sides of the river. The Mara was very
wet.

Some interesting sightings.

Martial Eagle killing a small lion cub. This eagle has now killed at least 3
lion cubs over the last 14 months.

Caspian Plovers. On the 4th there were 100s and maybe more scattered across
the plains above Musiara. I personally have never seen so many before. I
talked to several driver/guides and all commented on seeing so many small
birds across the plains.

Pallid and Montagu&#39;s Harriers. Just 1 Pallid but several Montagu&#39;s, all
immatures.

Greenshanks and Marsh Sandpipers. A group of 7 Greenshanks and 1 Marsh
Sandpiper feeding in flooded grassland.

European Bee-eaters. Many passing through feeding low above the ground every
day.

Barn Swallows. Many flying low all heading roughly easterly!

With one group of Barn Swallows was a very distinctive white rumped bird. At
first I thought it was a House Martin, but looking at it closely as it flew
away it looked more like a Swallow. I consulted Brian Finch over this and he
suggests that it was probably a race of the Red-rumped Swallow which have
been recorded before in Kenya.

Wheatears. Several Northern and 1 Isabelline.

Large numbers of Vultures at lion kills but no Hooded seen.  

Lastly, not a bird sighting, but a most exciting one. A Giant Forest Hog,
Trans Mara. It&#39;s my first sighting in over 30 years and I think only my 2nd
ever.
