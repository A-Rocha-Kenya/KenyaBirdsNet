  <pre>Dear All,
A look at the internet has revealed a few more interesting images,
which help with our lovebird bio-geography.

1. Firstly, this beautiful image was taken near Ndabaka Gate in the
western corridor of Serengeti. Just like Adam Kennedy’s image from the
same area, they look like Fischer’s in a proper sense. Amazingly we
have not received any images from Seronera. We really do need images
from wilderness areas around Lake Victoria, as suspected this is
looking like the true range of Fischer’s Lovebird, but it still has to
be confirmed.

2. Next, under Google Images there are numerous references to
Fischer’s Lovebirds, but throughout, birds are being portrayed as the
species representatives but clearly Ndutu types.

3. The following is an even worse example.

4. This image was taken allegedly in the wild, but no details given as
to location. It is such a beautiful Fischer’s-looking individual, it
would be good to know where it was taken.

5. The next image was kindly sent in by Nik Borrow, and shows the
image of how the bird is illustrated in the Handbook of the Birds of
the World. The concept of the bird is correct for a Fischer’s and in
no way suggests an Ndutu form, contra current publications.

6 &amp;7.The last two images relate to feral birds in Monaco that have
established themselves in colonies from escapees ten years ago.
Although called Fischer’s Lovebird, they are probably moving towards
the Ndutu form as well.

All for now
Brian
