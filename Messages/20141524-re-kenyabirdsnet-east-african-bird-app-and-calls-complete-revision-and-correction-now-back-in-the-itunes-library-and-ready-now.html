&gt; Love the bee-eater photo!
&gt; Did John F. mention when the Android App would be updated or have they both
&gt; been updated at the same time?

&gt;&gt; Deal All,
&gt;&gt; I have just this very moment heard from John Fanshawe, who said that
&gt;&gt; Apple have got our completely revised East African App available on
&gt;&gt; the ITunes library now.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; All those who have the App from the original version, will be notified
&gt;&gt; that the update is ready for a free download.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have also attached a image I just took this evening of Eurasian
&gt;&gt; Bee-eaters in our back paddock, sunning themselves in very low sun
&gt;&gt; (the first for four days I think), it shows colours you don&#39;t usually
&gt;&gt; see on bee-eaters electric being one of them!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; best to all
&gt;&gt; Brian
