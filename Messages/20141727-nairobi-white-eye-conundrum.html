  <pre>Dear All,

NAIROBI WHITE-EYE CONUNDRUM

Whilst we spend time looking out for interesting species on our
birding travels, there is a tendency to ignore what is under our very
noses. In the past two months I have been carrying out a morning walk
and sometimes another in the evening. In over twenty years of living
at this house I have never really birded the cow paddock at the back
of the house, which abuts IUCN. I have seen the odd interesting
species in the front garden over the years and ignored the back. In
the two months that back-paddock of two acres has produced over 170
species including some real suprises.
I have tried to photographically represent each species, and whilst
this has been not so bad with the passerines in the trees, the raptor
flyovers have been difficult, and of course almost in the time that it
takes to identify a raptor flying overhead it is virtually impossible
to get an image before it becomes a speck in the distance.

Around Nairobi, literature (and history) has told us that we are in
the unusual position, in fact unique position of having two species of
White-eyes that associate in mixed flocks. There has never been any
question of hybridisation. In the drier areas Abyssinian White-eye is
found, and in the forested areas it is Kikuyu White-eye (formerly a
race of Montane White-eye but now again with specific status and a
Kenyan endemic). If we have seen a large eye-ring we have called it
Kikuyu, and if we see a small eye-ring we call it Abyssinian. In the
areas where forest meets the drier open areas and gardens, we accept
that the two birds co-exist.

In my two-months of watching our commoner garden species and getting
to know more about them, white-eyes have fallen under the spotlight. I
had thought that we had Kikuyu as rather irregular visitors, and the
commoner visitor was Abyssinian. But now I was scrutinising the
white-eyes around the house maybe for the first time, I was finding
that the birds were neither Kikuyu nor Montane, and it looked as if we
have been missing something resembling Yellow White-eyes, living
amongst us. When I got the first decent images of the birds, I wrote
to Don Turner stating that I thought that we had Yellow White-eyes
here in Nairobi and they had been hiding under the Kikuyu/Abyssinian
blanket. He kindly wrote back immediately saying that he agreed that
the birds neither resembled Kikuyu nor Montane and suggested that they
might be Mbulu. This bird has also been elevated to specific status
from out of the Montane pot, in Kenya the distribution is limited to
Ol Doinyo Orok (the forested mountain at Namanga), and common on
Chyulus. I have since been able to locate images of mbuluensis, and
they are not the same as my birds here, they possess the large
eye-ring of the poliogaster group, and I still believe that we have
Yellow White-eye or something very similar in Nairobi. White-eye
taxonomy is a real nightmare.

A typical Kikuyu White-eye has a very large white eye-ring, broken by
black loral-line, the eye-ring is wider on the lower than upper half.
The underparts are mainly dark olive-green with bright yellow
restricted on throat and centre of breast. The forehead band is broad
extending well up on to forecrown and blends into yellow-green of
centre-crown.

A typical Abyssinian White-eye has a small, and in our region uniquely
complete white eye-ring that is not broken by a black loral line. The
underparts are entirely lemon-yellow including flanks, and the
upperparts greenish-yellow not olive-green. The forehead band is
extremely narrow, stopping level with the top of the eye-ring, but
barely contrasting against the pale greenish-yellow of the rest of the
crown.

A typical Yellow White-eye has a middle-range white eye-ring,
sometimes crenellated like Kikuyu White-eye. The lores are very black
and bisect the white eye-ring in the front. Underparts are very
variable over its extensive distribution, bright yellow with
olive-green on the flanks or the throat and breast olive green but the
flanks yellow like belly, or wholly yellow-green below with only the
forehead band being yellow. The band is yellow, but blends into the
yellow-green of the crown level with the top of the eye-ring, but
little contrast on the crown, more on the supra-loral region.

The birds that I think will be turn out to be the form the most
widespread in fairly lush Nairobi gardens are typically with a
middle-range white-eye ring like Yellow, that is usually crenellated.
Although it is broken in the front like Yellow and Kikuyu, unlike the
complete eye-ring of Abyssinian. The lores are in some cases barely
darker than the surrounding loral area, or appear blackish in others.
Underparts are bright yellow on throat and olive-yellow on breast,
more olive-green on flanks. The yellow forehead band is extremely
narrow, and on some individuals the entire crown is greenish with the
yellow confined to the supra-loral area in front of the eyes.
Most white-eyes we encounter are giving the typical contact calls
insterspersed with random musical warbles, and rarely do we hear a
complete song from any of the species. I have video of this “Langata”
White-eye in full voice. It is a remarkable songster and sings for
minutes on end in an almost canary-like refrain in which it introduces
quite perfect imitations of other small birds with which it shares the
garden.

Representatives of these forms from Nairobi area are attached.

It would be an interesting exercise to photograph the white-eyes that
are living around your Nairobi house, so we can see what we have in
the area, and see if normal Abyssinians are in the dry areas, and
normal Kikuyu are in the forested areas.

Comments on this and reports on findings and images most welcome.
Whatever the true story here, it is obviously something that to date
has received little attention.

Best to all
Brian
