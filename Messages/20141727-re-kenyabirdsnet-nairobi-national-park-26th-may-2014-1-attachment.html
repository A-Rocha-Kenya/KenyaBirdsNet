      <p>Dear All,<br>
<br>
NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 26th May 2014<br>
<br>
….and so it was now 5.40pm and we were hurrying towards the Langata<br>
Gate to be checked out by 6.00pm. A quick check of the small Langata<br>
Forest Dam not far from the gate rewarded us with a very nice<br>
Madagascar Pond Heron, and an extremely attractive breeding plumaged<br>
extravert Lesser Moorhen. Leaving here although now only one and a<br>
half kilometres for the gate we stopped at the small bridge over the<br>
Mokoyeti River, and there peering at us from under the cover of the<br>
overhanging vegetation was a sub-adult Black Stork (it’s 26th<br>
May!!!!), and within another minute we were on time exiting Langata<br>
Gate.<br>
That is how our day in Nairobi National Park finished with a bang, but<br>
now back to the start…..<br>
<br>
It had been dry the past few days and the rains have so far let us<br>
down rather badly, but the traffic along Magadi Road and on to Langata<br>
Road was rather light, and we managed to get from my house to the Main<br>
Entrance of Nairobi National Park in less than ten minutes.<br>
<br>
Here Adam Kennedy, Karen Plumbe kindly acting as the days chauffeur<br>
and myself met up with Jennifer Oduori, and we were processed through<br>
the gate by 6.50am.<br>
<br>
Being a dull day, we could not build up the enthusiasm to visit the<br>
KWS Mess gardens which of late have not been too rewarding, and so<br>
opted for Ivory Burning Site complete with new incredibly hideous<br>
monument designed by people with no knowledge of art or beauty. If you<br>
find this comment a little harsh, then I suggest you pay a personal<br>
visit to this new addition. Birdwise, nothing happening at all, so we<br>
boarded for Nagalomon Dam, with a Spotted Thick-knee in the drift, and<br>
another two on the waters edge. There was a young Jacobin Cuckoo along<br>
the causeway, on the “island” were many Long-tailed Cormorants with a<br>
young Great, and a male Darter. Just one Black-crowned Night-Heron was<br>
in the trees.<br>
<br>
Leaving here we set off on the back road to Hyena Dam (which now<br>
doesn’t get there because of the new swamp), it was quiet on the road<br>
with a Slender Mongoose running along ahead of us and the first of so<br>
many Sunis today, an African Firefinch was in full voice, a pair of<br>
Brown Parrots were in the fig, and a Laughing Dove was unusual in this<br>
part of the Park. The new swamp was not the same with no palearctic<br>
waders seen all day, African Water Rails called from concealment,<br>
there were two Yellow-billed Ducks and eight Red-billed Teal and that<br>
was it. We retraced our route back and headed to Hyena Dam. Four<br>
Egyptian Mongooses were playing in the road shortly before the dam,<br>
however they were all adult sized, and two lionesses were in the<br>
grass.<br>
<br>
It was quiet at Hyena Dam, not the hive of activity we had been used<br>
to in the past few months. There were a number of Plain Martins<br>
feeding over the water, and a late Barn Swallow joined them and six<br>
Banded Martins also came in for a brief period. Water Rails were<br>
calling from the typha but stayed in cover. Following the creek we<br>
found the small Great Egret, and were delighted to see that the pair<br>
of Long-toed Plovers are still present.<br>
<br>
Now heading out to Karen Primary School Dam we had a young<br>
white-headed Martial Eagle on the run-off, the first of six<br>
Black-shouldered Kites, and the first of six Secretarybirds. In the<br>
grass were many Cisticolas, a Red-faced sang along the Mokoyeti and<br>
there were a few Orange-breasted Waxbills. Just beyond Lone Tree a<br>
very late Black Stork was seen flying in the distance, it seemed to<br>
have a black neck. The bird in the evening near Langata Gate had a<br>
buff head and upper neck and did not look the same individual but to<br>
have two Black Storks in the Park at this time of year would be to say<br>
the least extraordinary (just one is!).<br>
<br>
Karen Primary School Dam still had the large young Spur-winged Goose,<br>
and Eland Hollow held on to its African Jacana, and the usual Hippo.<br>
Continuing in the direction of Athi Dam we found a nice male Namaqua<br>
Dove right out in the plains, several Rosy-breasted Longclaws, a<br>
Long-billed Pipit, a scattering of Quail-finch, but the biggest<br>
surprise was a party of six Cut-throats, only the second documented<br>
record for the Park.<br>
<br>
There were three Chandler’s Reedbucks resting in their usual place,<br>
and soon we arrived at the murrum pits at the top of Athi Basin. The<br>
vultures were in, there were 37 White-backed and nine Ruppell’s and a<br>
bird that looked like an immature Eurasian Griffon Vulture (see image<br>
attached). There was a pair of White-bellied Bustards, that were our<br>
only bustards of the day.<br>
<br>
At the top of the descent road was a male, collared Lion. Athi Dam is<br>
not quite as interesting now the palearctics have departed, leaving<br>
just one lone White Stork. There were some eighty Marabous which<br>
entertained us for a while. Three were in extremely attractive (if you<br>
could imagine it possible), breeding plumage. The birds were big, and<br>
yet we were surrounded with what appeared to be undersized Marabous.<br>
Are there any populations of small Marabous that might be visiting us,<br>
because the size difference was dramatic? Other birds present were an<br>
adult Pink-backed Pelican, eight African Spoonbills, a pair of<br>
Yellow-billed Duck, eight Spur-winged and fifteen Kittlitz’s Plovers,<br>
and a new high of eleven Speckled Pigeons. On the causeway five<br>
Black-crowned Night-Herons roosted in the trees and whilst we had our<br>
lunch three Black-faced Sandgrouse came in and drank at the waters<br>
edge. This is the fifth record of the species in the Park, and all<br>
within the past year. A lone Lesser Masked Weaver fed in the acacias.<br>
<br>
Continuing back to the main road from the causeway two of the<br>
Sandgrouse were now on the track in front of the car, and no sooner<br>
had we turned on to the main road (from Cheetah Gate), there was the<br>
first Eastern Chanting Goshawk in the Park for eight years, a<br>
beautiful adult attacking a fully hooded Black-necked Spitting Cobra.<br>
<br>
Now heading in the direction of the Hippo Pools were the trio of<br>
female, teenager and baby Black Rhinos, an attractive pair of<br>
Black-faced Waxbills, and there were at least 900 Marabous roosting in<br>
the trees along the Mbagathi.<br>
<br>
We were now travelling faster towards Kingfisher, there was an<br>
immature (different bird to earlier) Martial Eagle just above Hippo<br>
Pools and a Pangani Longclaw near the exit to Maasai Gate. The burnt<br>
area was disappointing but we did have two beautiful Cyrtanthus<br>
lilies.<br>
<br>
Now heading for a departure out of Langate Gate we stopped at the<br>
forest edge dam near the gate finding the only Little Grebe of the<br>
day, and the Madagascar Pond Heron and Lesser Moorhen which is where<br>
this report started.<br>
<br>
Mammals were mainly confined to the edge of the Mbagathi River, but<br>
species like Zebra and Wildebeest have come back in now it is drying.<br>
<br>
A slow start to a very spectacular day, with species very rarely<br>
recorded in the Park, and an easy return by road,<br>
<br>
Best to all<br>

TOP RIGHT MARABOU STORK<br>
This is evidently a comfortable resting position for this individual.<br>
It would persistently rest on one leg, whilst the free legs claw would<br>
grip the ankle of the supporting leg. Never heard of this before.<br>
