<p class="MsoNormal">Dear All,</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">While birding with a group from the rooftop terrace of Serena
Mountain Lodge on the afternoon of 12<sup>th</sup> May 2014, we found ourselves
inundated by the resident white-throated Skye’s Monkeys and they took up
positions on the balconies and proceeded to scan the scene. Suddenly, one animal
that I was photographing jumped off the balcony and returned about 30 seconds
later with a bird in its mouth that I could see was a male Harlequin Quail. The
bird appeared limp and ‘fresh’ but there was no indication that it was alive.
The monkey was bold in its attempts to keep the prey item to itself and proceeded to
eat the bird head first.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This observation was noteworthy on two counts; firstly, I would imagine there are few records of this monkey species eating a Harlequin Quail. Secondly, it
was a strange location for a Harlequin Quail which I can only suppose was
migrating over the forest of Mount Kenya at night and drawn to the bright
lights of the lodge. We’ll never know if the bird was already dead or just
recuperating after an exhaustive night before it was ‘dispatched’.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Sadly, it was the observation of the quail on our trip!</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Cheers for now,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Adam</p>
