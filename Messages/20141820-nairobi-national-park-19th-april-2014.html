  <pre>NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 19th April 2014



Dear All,

Being a public holiday period, and having to charge the Smart Card
long delays were expected at the Paying counter, but the lady there
handled things very efficiently, and Nigel Hunter and myself were in
the gate at Main Entrance at 6.45am.

We decided to give KWS Mess a miss, as it has been very unproductive
recently, and continued to Ivory Burning Site. Here we found two
Olivaceous Warblers, and the first of twelve Spotted Flycatchers as
well as a pair of Brown Parisomas.
