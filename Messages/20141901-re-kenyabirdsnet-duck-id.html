  <pre>Hi Colin,
I must admit that I did not spend much time with the duck image, so I
downloaded it again and had another look. I still came to the same
thoughts though, that of a young White-faced Whistling Duck.
My reasons were that on looking at Doris&#39;s images, a White-backed that
age would be showing signs of tiger-banding on back and probably on
the flanks. This bird shows a uniform back with no indication of any
pattern forming, even the rump should be barred for White-backed.
White-backed ducklings still show a white blaze at the base of the
bill from an early age (younger than this bird) like adults, but there
is no sign of this here. White-backed have pale underparts but with
dark barring, but already the unmarked dark maroon breast of WFWD is
present on this bird. The flanks show the start of the fine barring on
each breast feather of WFWD, that at a distance look vermiculated,
White-backs progress from uniform flanks to banded, but not
vermiculated. On the image of the bird out of the water, you can see
the pattern of WFWD more clearly.
The images also give the impression of a bird having been diving, but
young Whistling Ducks habitually dive for food but maybe less
elegantly than a normal diving duck.
That it why I still opt for the WFWD option,
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Jizz looks much more like a White-backed Duck, Brian... Haven&#39;t checked
&gt; in the books what a juv looks like, but that would be my immediate take
&gt; on it...

&gt;&gt; Dear Doris,
&gt;&gt; This is a young White-faced Whistling-Duck, they must have bred there,

&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear All,
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Found this duck at Nguuni NS (North of Mombasa) a few days ago &amp;
&gt;&gt; would be
&gt;&gt; &gt; happy if somebody could help to identify it.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Due to the fading sunlight shortly before sunset I couldn&#39;t get a
&gt;&gt; &gt; better
&gt;&gt; &gt; photo!
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Thank you &amp;
