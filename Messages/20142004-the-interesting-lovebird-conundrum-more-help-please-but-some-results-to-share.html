Dear All,

There have been some really nice images coming in, and we have now got
an east to west preliminary cline from Yellow-collared to Fischerâ€™s,
but more images still desired.

All of these birds from Tanzania are wild, with no evidence of any
man-made introduction of other forms into their territories.

Best for now
