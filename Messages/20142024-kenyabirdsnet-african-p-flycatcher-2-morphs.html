  <pre>Dear Peter, James and all,
Just to show what a spectacular bird ferreti is, attached are images I
found on the net from Ethiopia. Whilst I was ferreting around for this
bird (pun intended) I found an image of a bird taken in Nakuru!!!
Now although the guides have sadly omitted the bird, now you know what
you are on the lookout for!
Best for now
Brian
