  <pre>Dear All,
Here are my recordings of first dates in Nairobi National Park for
this migrant season (excluding waders). Many of these species do not
usually make an appearance here, until well into November in a normal
year.

The four without dates were recorded elsewhere in September.

October 4th was the first visit in NNP for five weeks, so was
effectively first day of recording during southern passage.

It will be interesting to compare these findings with records
elsewhere in East Africa.

Best to all
Brian
