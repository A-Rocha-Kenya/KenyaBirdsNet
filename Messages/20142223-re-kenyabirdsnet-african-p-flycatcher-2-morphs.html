  <pre>Dear Peter,
This is an exciting find, it is the race ferreti. I have only seen the
bird as you describe twice, and both were in Nairobi NP. They are
otherwise unreported, and this is the most beautiful of all the
Paradise Flycatcher forms. Stevenson and Fanshawe do not mention the
race at all, and have no illustration. Zimmermann &amp; Turner seen to
have something askew, as they do mention ferreti, and even say it is
widespread in our region however in the description they mention white
on the wing, but nothing of that long white tail that you saw. So I
think it is a bit mixed up in the literature and needs some revision.
Where exactly are the Kilome Hills?
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Hi Birders!
&gt;
&gt; Over the weekend I was hiking in Kilome hills where I observed
&gt; one African Paradise Flycatcher with two morphs i.e rufous and white.
&gt; It looked like the common rufous morph with the glossy black head,blue eye
&gt; wattle,
&gt; greyish part below and the mantle was rufous. However the wings and the long
&gt; tail were
&gt; all in pure white morph. Unfortunately I did&#39;n carry my camera with me for
&gt; the photo though.
&gt; Could it be a resultant of interbreeding and is it confined to a particular
&gt; region perhaps?
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
