  <pre>Dear George,
They are still at Nambale on the Sio, including some really impressive
males. I have seen them also west of Mungatsi in the past but the
habitat is gone. You might also be interested in that there is still a
population of Patas at the research station at Alupe.
Best for now
Brian

&gt; I
&gt; have a student who plans to carry out her thesis work on cryptic De Brazza
&gt; monkey  along River Sio, around Mungatsi
&gt; area and in Busia generally. The student basically wants to understand the
&gt; current population status of this small sub-population and edge effects,
&gt; other threats, (loss of riparian vegetation and other habitats,
&gt; hunting, culture etc) and community attitudes towards its conservation.
&gt;
&gt; I
&gt; remember seeing this species a few years ago at Mungatsi. Has anyone of you
&gt; seen it recently and anywhere within the  Busia grasslands area. Any
&gt; documentation on the species from that area is also welcome. Please share
&gt; with
&gt; us.
&gt; eshiamwatagw@yahoo.co.uk  and the student is ojujud@yahoo.com
&gt;
&gt; Kindly
&gt; let us know.
&gt;
&gt; Thank
&gt; you.
