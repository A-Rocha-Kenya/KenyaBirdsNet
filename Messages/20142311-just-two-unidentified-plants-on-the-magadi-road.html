  <pre>Dear All,

I wrote up the day on Magadi Road last Sunday, and mentioned some nice
plants. Several Nigel and I have since identified, and a few we found
in Blundell whilst there, but two just won&#39;t reveal themselves to us
in Blundell or Upland Flowers, and if anyone can identify them it
would be well received.

The first is a stunning &#34;scroph-like&#34; individual that we found in
loose rocky substrate near Ol Tepesi near a lava outcrop that is the
most frustrating of the two as it looks pretty unique.

The second is an obvious Amaranth but very attractive. In the image
appears hairless and the underside of the leaves reddish. This was by
the road just past the Ol Kejo Bridge in naturally water disturbed
soil and gravel.

Thanks for you help in this,

Brian
