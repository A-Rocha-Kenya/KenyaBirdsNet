  <pre>Hi all
Just to report that while guiding for Exotic Birding on 1 Dec at 
river Mungatsi we had a male Superb Sunbird. The dark maroon on the 
belly to side running down the flanks were quite visible especially 
when the bird came out in the light. We had him for about a dozen 
minutes and occasionally he came out to the sunlight otherwise bigger 
portion of the time spent watching him, he fed right inside the tree 
bushes where canopy seemed thick. Frequently he raised a blue crest 
kind off at the back from the top of the nape reminding me the old 
punk hairstyle. Non of us had brought the camera on the walk but at 
lunch having picnic i went back to the same place and spend about 
30min in search but in vain.

Same day we had 2 Piapiacs at Mumias and the previous day we had a 
Black-billed Turaco in Kakamega Forest

Cheers and best wishes for the year 2014
