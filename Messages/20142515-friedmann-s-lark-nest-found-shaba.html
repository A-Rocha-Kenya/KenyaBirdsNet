  <pre>Hi Chege,
Forgive me, but you need a bigger profile than hiding this find under
breeding bee-eaters!

Have you got some images, because I am sure that you have the first
nest of the species every found.

Every year at this time, they are singing on the same ridge on the way
to the lava fields. I have also flushed them in the non-breeding
season and suspect that they are not so migratory as people think....
just secretive.

I have seen Somali Bee-eaters nesting in a long low bank (rather like
a step), shortly after the Main Gate in Shaba, on the right side not
far from the buildings,

Best for now
Brian
