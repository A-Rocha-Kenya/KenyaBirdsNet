  <div dir="ltr"><div><div><div><div>Hi Clive,<br><br></div>Find attached an image of the illadopsis in question. You are not alone in thinking that Mountain doesn&#39;t occur at this site and I tend to agree with your supposition that these birds might be recent immigrants from other areas, which is understandable given the loss of forest habitat in the region over the past 30 years.<br>
<br></div>One minor corretion to Titus&#39; records is that Yellow-whiskered Greenbuls were caught rather than Yellow-throated. Rather modestly, he also omitted my lifer that he pulled from the net - Grey-chested Babbler (definitely not an Illadopsis!).<br>

I once found a dead Gabon Viper there but never a Jameson&#39;s Mamba. I did have a Spitting Cobra get entangled in my mistnets in my house in Soroti when I was away. It died and was badly decomposed when I found it.<br>

<br></div>I ringed regularly there in the early 1970&#39;s and wrote up my results in <i>Ostrich</i> 1985. 56: 236-262.<br></div> I only found Mountain Illadopsis at one site which was higher than the Rest House area, and was in fact in Nandi District. This part of the forest was destroyed in the 1980s. I wondered if you could have been mistaken and perhaps it was Brown Illadopsis you caught. I suppose it is possible that Mountain has moved to a lower altitude.<br>
