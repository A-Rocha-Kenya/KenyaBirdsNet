  Dear All,<br>I write about this undiscovered haven in Nyeri. There is a coffee estate (Ndurutu Coffee Estate) in Kingongo which was neglected for a number of years. As a result the whole estate turned into bushes. Being rather clever at it, birds have settled in the estate in drovers: both in numbers and species. I would imagine it would be quite an experience for an experienced Birder.<br><br>It has in the meantime been sold and subdivided into residential plots but the buyers are yet to start developing but I expect they could start anytime soon. It would be pity if the developments happen before the current tenants of the estate are documents somehow. I&nbsp; happen to be one of the buyers and I already have a place where I can accommodate (in a camp site) - with prior arrangement - an interested Birder(s). <br><br>Anyone out there interested can get in touch:0722-359190.<br><br>Merry all,<br><br>Kingori Wathobio<br><p><span><br class="yui-cursor"></span></p>
