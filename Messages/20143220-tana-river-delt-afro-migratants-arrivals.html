  Early&nbsp; June number of Cuckoos(African / not quite sure as i was driving and the bird were to shy when i make a stop it will fly away ) seen around Moa and on the highway Witu Garsen road. Just yesterday a group of 8 northern Carmine bee eaters on the tree around Mijila Tarasaa junction. they were foraging near wetlands within roadside.<br>since it has been raining the Wetlands are filled with water and there is a need to explore the species of birds which may inhabited the area.<br>Good birding<br><p><span><br class="yui-cursor"></span></p>
