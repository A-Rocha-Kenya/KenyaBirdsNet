  <pre>Greetings birders

It was an exciting morning for the 40+ bird watchers of Nature Kenya&#39;s
Wednesday Morning Birdwalk at the Karen Blixen Museum on March 12.

In addition to a good variety of forest birds, we saw two species rarely
recorded in Nairobi:

Shikra - a small goshawk with a pale front and a large red eye. In the past
I have only seen Shikra at Kasarani Stadium and Sukari Dam at the other end
of the city. Later we also saw a Little Sparrowhawk.

Golden-tailed Woodpecker - the spots on the forehead of the female and near
the neck of the male were clearly seen. We heard the woodpecker calling, and
played the App to be sure. I have only recorded this species once in Nairobi
before Â­ in a garden just across the road from the Karen Blixen Museum, some
years ago. We also saw a Brown-backed Woodpecker.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
