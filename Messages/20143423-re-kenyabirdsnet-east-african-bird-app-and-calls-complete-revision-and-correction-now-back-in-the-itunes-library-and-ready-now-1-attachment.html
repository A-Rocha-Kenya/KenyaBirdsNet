      <p>Deal All,<br>
I have just this very moment heard from John Fanshawe, who said that<br>
Apple have got our completely revised East African App available on<br>
the ITunes library now.<br>
<br>
All those who have the App from the original version, will be notified<br>
that the update is ready for a free download.<br>
<br>
I have also attached a image I just took this evening of Eurasian<br>
Bee-eaters in our back paddock, sunning themselves in very low sun<br>
(the first for four days I think), it shows colours you don&#39;t usually<br>
see on bee-eaters electric being one of them!<br>
<br>
best to all<br>
Brian<br>
