  <pre>Hi Tom,
I believe that the Oribi came from the Krugers Farm at Eldoret some
years ago when the habitat was under threat. Oribi have not been a
native to the area, but of course are found both in the west and the
east where they are common at Kipini on the coast.
At least they are a native Kenyan mammal which cannot be said for White Rhino,
Best for now

&gt; I don&#39;t believe that Oribi are native in the Nairobi. They are present in
&gt; Mara (although possibly not common) and  certainly common in Ruma NP. It is
&gt; far from clear to me why they were introduced at all since unlike the
&gt; exotic south African White Rhino they are not globally threatened
&gt;

&gt; PS: We seem to see far less Black Rhino in in NNP these days. A few years

&gt;
&gt; Are Oribi Ourebia ourebi also an &#39;introduced species&#39; to Nairobi National
&gt; Park?  I thought that this species was brought into NNP from SW Kenya (i.e.,
&gt; O. o. cottoni).
&gt;
&gt; I am not aware of any earlier records of Oribi for the Nairobi area.  Are
&gt; there any such records?

&gt;
&gt; Dear Paula and all,
&gt; This is horrifying, and shows why we have to keep an eye on actions
&gt; taken by KWS in all sorts of their underhand manners, as you said in
&gt; your previous correspondence they are so secretive in what they do. Of
&gt; course what they do is completely illegal, and it&#39;s time that the
&gt; conservationist minded public were fully aware of the mishandling of
&gt; Nairobi National Park. It&#39;s so difficult nowadays to write anything
&gt; complementary about KWS in Nairobi, but I suppose there must be
&gt; something somewhere.
&gt; From my own standpoint the integrity of Nairobi National Park as a
&gt; reserve for native wildlife was breached when (and I am sure only for
&gt; a tourist attraction) White Rhinos were introduced to the Park. As
&gt; Kenya has never been the home for these beasts, (which I am very fond
&gt; of by the way), they have as little right to call NNP home as House
&gt; Crows in Mombasa, they are an exotic, never native to Kenya and should
&gt; not have been introduced into what up to then was a natural ecosystem
&gt; as far as mammalian species were concerned.
&gt; Had the White Rhinos not had been introduced, we would probably not
&gt; have had the associated problems that we have now, with them being a
&gt; magnet to poachers. They can only bring us trouble and the time is now
&gt; to relocate them in a safe area elsewhere.
&gt;
&gt; Do you know that on Sunday, with Fleur and some visitors, we were
&gt; birding along the Cheetah Gate Road. We have always been exceedingly
&gt; suspicious of the great area of land along the Mbagathi in that little
&gt; visited SE corner, being fenced off. Whilst I don&#39;t think that
&gt; anything honest from KWS has satisfactorily explained the fencing of
&gt; this portion of the Park, now the road to Cheetah Gate has been
&gt; blocked with the electric fence continuing across the road from the
&gt; Cement Factory. This definitely looks like an Illegal Excision of a
&gt; large part of the Park to me, what do others feel?
&gt;
&gt; Then of course there is the mystery fence at the back of Hyena Dam,
&gt; another Excision?, and what about the Pylons????
&gt; Best to all

&gt;&gt; Dear friends,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I was horrified today to see that KWS have started fencing off a huge
&gt;&gt; piece
&gt;&gt; of the Nairobi National Park for the major expansion of the Nairobi
&gt;&gt; Orphanage. See attached photo. The fence follows the main road from the
&gt;&gt; entrance all the way to the club house - which is almost to the ivory
&gt;&gt; burn
&gt;&gt; site.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I am writing to request that you help me to demand an immediate halt
&gt;&gt; these
&gt;&gt; plans. I have identified the following arguments; you may have others
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1. Expanding the orphanage violates the very original purpose of the
&gt;&gt; orphanage - to home orphans and act as a half way house before they are
&gt;&gt; released. The orphanage was never intended as a zoo which is what it
&gt;&gt; seems
&gt;&gt; KWS wants to create. The Safari Walk on the other hand was created as a
&gt;&gt; zoo
&gt;&gt; - there is no need for two zoos in the same place in Nairobi. Moreover,
&gt;&gt; wilderness in the National Park should not be sacrificed for the creation
&gt;&gt; of or expansion of a zoo, instead a wholesome education experience
&gt;&gt; through
&gt;&gt; visitation to the park should be promoted as it is far more valuable.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 2. The area for expansion will require the destruction of a sizeable
&gt;&gt; piece
&gt;&gt; of Nairobi Park. We are not aware of any EIA having been conducted, nor
&gt;&gt; are we aware of any stakeholder consultation having taken place. As you
&gt;&gt; know, FoNNaP which is 19 years old, has always defended the park and
&gt;&gt; although our board meets regularly with the warden, there has been no
&gt;&gt; consultation of these plans, and we have not been informed of these or
&gt;&gt; any
&gt;&gt; other plans for developments in the park.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 3. We believe that these developments are in violation of the management
&gt;&gt; plan of the park which is already out of date having expired a few years
&gt;&gt; ago. It is also therefore a violation of the new Act which requires parks
&gt;&gt; to have management plans that are developed through a stakeholder
&gt;&gt; consultative process.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 4. The area of land that is being fenced off will result in the
&gt;&gt; destruction
&gt;&gt; of highly endangered tropical highland forest including habitats for
&gt;&gt; endangered add endangered species, as well as species of concern
&gt;&gt; including
&gt;&gt; lions, jackals, leopard, Crowned eagle (one of the only 2 nesting pairs
&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt; Nairobi nests in these trees), Suni, duiker, black rhino and forest hog
&gt;&gt; all
&gt;&gt; live in this part of the forest. I am sure there are also plants, birds
&gt;&gt; and other animals that will also be threatened. By degrading this habitat
&gt;&gt; and alienating it from the park the KWS will be violating the EMCA, and
&gt;&gt; failure to consult the stakeholders is in violation of the constitution.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have written to the Director KWS, NEMA Director and the CS to
&gt;&gt; respectfully request the immediate halt to the ongoing fencing of the
&gt;&gt; park,
&gt;&gt; as it is not too late to restore any damage already caused.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have also asked for an investigation to be initiated into how this
&gt;&gt; proposal was developed and passed without any stakeholder consultation or
&gt;&gt; EIA.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Please help by sending your own letter to the Cabinet Secretary, KWS
&gt;&gt; Director (Director@kws.org) and NEMA DG &lt;gmwahungu@gmail.com&gt;on this
&gt;&gt; issue
&gt;&gt; so that they can see how serious this is.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Kind Regards
&gt;&gt;
