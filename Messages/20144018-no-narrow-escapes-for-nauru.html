  <DIV><U>Dear BIOPLANNERS,</U></DIV>
  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
  <DIV><U>Environmental, or ecological economics has presented with endless, 
  larger and larger estimations of the value of biodiversity and ecosystem 
  services, but sometimes a simple example can speak more eloquently and clear 
  about what the loss of natural capital can mean.</U></DIV>
  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
  <DIV><U>As part of my preparation for a combined work/vacation trip to the 
  Pacific, I re-discovered this succinct revelation of the difference between 
  "hard" and "soft" sustainability.</U></DIV>

  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
  <DIV><U>As David Orr points out, the current financial meltdown has, among 
  other things, exposed the absurdity of the economic notion of sustainability. 
  Standard economics uses a financial model to translate “nature” into 
  money-producing assets (Arrow et al. 2004). An economy is sustainable if at 
  least as much money can be added to the balance sheet by transforming the 
  natural world into money than by leaving it alone. By this logic people in the 
  future will be better off because they will have enjoyed a greater rate of 
  return (more GDP) on their capital investments (manufactured, human, and 
  natural capital). There is no need to worry about running out of any 
  particular thing because money is a perfectly fungible substitute for anything 
  (Gowdy 2000).<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;</U></DIV>
  <DIV><U>The ephemeral nature of financial capital and the irreversibility of 
  the destruction of nature were lessons learned the hard way by the small 
  island nation of Nauru, located just south of the equator between Australia 
  and Hawaii. The recent history of Nauru provides a sobering perspective from 
  which to judge the current global transformation of nature into financial 
  capital.</U></DIV>
  <DIV><BR><U>&nbsp; Until the beginning of the last century Nauru was a 
  pleasant South Sea island with a stable population and a bountiful 
  environment. But around 1900 it was discovered that the island was made almost 
  entirely of phosphate, a valuable and essential ingredient for fertilizer. 
  Over the course of the last 100 years or so most of Nauru has been rendered 
  uninhabitable by mining, leaving only a narrow strip of land around the 
  island’s perimeter.</U></DIV>
  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
  <DIV><U>Today the island is impoverished and it seems certain that Nauru’s 
  population will have to be relocated.</U></DIV>
  <DIV><U>But according to the economic model of sustainability the people of 
  Nauru made the correct decision when they decided to continue phosphate mining 
  after independence in 1968 (Gowdy &amp; McDaniel 1999; McDaniel &amp; Gowdy 
  2000). At that point Nauru was saving over 20% of its annual phosphate income, 
  apparently assuring its continued prosperity after the phosphate was gone. 
  Nauruan financial wealth reached its peak in the mid 1980s as the value of its 
  trust fund reached one billion Australian dollars and annual phosphate 
  revenues were still about US$100 million. Per capita income was the highest in 
  the world and most services - education, health care, utilities - were free 
  and Nauruans paid no taxes.</U></DIV>
  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
  <DIV><U>But as history has shown time and again, financial capital can 
  evaporate overnight. Nauru’s trust fund was decimated by bad investments, 
  predatory financiers, and the Asian financial meltdown of the late 1990s. 
  Today the US$1 billion trust fund is nonexistent. The people of Nauru face a 
  bleak future with no source of income other than foreign aid. The island’s 
  educational and health care systems are in disarray. Nauru’s once bountiful 
  environment is no longer capable of supporting even a fraction of the island’s 
  current population. Foraging and fishing skills that supported the population 
  for thousands of years have been forgotten. Nauru traded its biophysical 
  environment for money and now it has neither.</U></DIV>
  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
  <DIV><U>The current worldwide economic crisis, which began with the burst of 
  the housing bubble, has exposed a labyrinth of financial instruments totally 
  unfamiliar to most of us. The sheer size of the alphabet soup of these 
  financial concoctions—ABXs, CDOs, CDSs—is staggering. For example, the value 
  of credit default swaps (CDSs), intended to insure against bonds and other 
  debt instruments going into default, amounted to more than US$50 trillion 
  (Soros 2008). This is many times the value of the assets CDSs were supposed to 
  insure and about 3 times the annual U.S. GDP.</U></DIV>
  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
  <DIV><U>As we watch the collapse of the financial bubble it is easy to dismiss 
  the evaporation of these assets as “imaginary.” But like Nauru’s trust fund 
  these assets were created by trans-forming nature’s bounty (cheap energy, 
  biodiversity, and a stable climate to name a few) and human ingenuity and 
  labor power into what was thought to be safe investments. The guiding idea is 
  that one form of capital is as good as another and in aggregate can expand ad 
  infinitum.</U></DIV>
  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
  <DIV><U>The damage we are doing to the Earth’s climate and biological 
  diversity will not be repaired for tens if not hundreds of thousands of years 
  (Archer 2009). The logic of this destruction makes sense only within one 
  peculiar and parochial value system (market capitalism) which, like all other 
  human social systems, will come and go in a geological instant. But within 
  this geological instant, as a consequence of our value system and its 
  misguided myths, the human experience on Earth will be diminished forever if 
  we do not somehow gain control of the forces destroying the biophysical basis 
  of human 
prosperity.&nbsp;</U></DIV></DIV></DIV><BR></DIV></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></FONT></DIV></FONT></BODY></HTML>
