  <pre>Thanks for this Peter, I think I know exactly where you mean. There
are some nice unwatched hills in there, I think you can get through to
the Machakos-Wote road? It will be very interesting to see if you find
any more there.
Best for now
Brian

&gt; From Mombasa road you turn left immediately you get to Salama town then
&gt; drive about
&gt; 15km. We started hiking from Mukaa High School heading eastwards,that is
&gt; where I spotted the AP Flycatcher.
&gt; You will be kept company by several Augur Buzzards hovering above you,not to
&gt; mention the scenic landscape which is just amazing!

&gt; Thanks for this James it will be very nice to see the images. But I
&gt; wonder where the birds down here are originating from, it&#39;s difficult
&gt; to conceive that they would wander down here from Ethiopia, but
&gt; stranger things have happened.
&gt; Best for now

&gt;&gt; The race ferreti, is common and widespread here in Ethiopia, especially,
&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt; the SW. I will check through my pics and attach some for your perusal and
&gt;&gt; records too.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Happy birding always,

&gt;&gt; Dear Peter,
&gt;&gt; This is an exciting find, it is the race ferreti. I have only seen the
&gt;&gt; bird as you describe twice, and both were in Nairobi NP. They are
&gt;&gt; otherwise unreported, and this is the most beautiful of all the
&gt;&gt; Paradise Flycatcher forms. Stevenson and Fanshawe do not mention the
&gt;&gt; race at all, and have no illustration. Zimmermann &amp; Turner seen to
&gt;&gt; have something askew, as they do mention ferreti, and even say it is
&gt;&gt; widespread in our region however in the description they mention white
&gt;&gt; on the wing, but nothing of that long white tail that you saw. So I
&gt;&gt; think it is a bit mixed up in the literature and needs some revision.
&gt;&gt; Where exactly are the Kilome Hills?
&gt;&gt; Best for now
&gt;&gt; Brian

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Birders!
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Over the weekend I was hiking in Kilome hills where I observed
&gt;&gt;&gt; one African Paradise Flycatcher with two morphs i.e rufous and white.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It looked like the common rufous morph with the glossy black head,blue
&gt;&gt;&gt; eye
&gt;&gt;&gt; wattle,
&gt;&gt;&gt; greyish part below and the mantle was rufous. However the wings and the
&gt;&gt;&gt; long
&gt;&gt;&gt; tail were
&gt;&gt;&gt; all in pure white morph. Unfortunately I did&#39;n carry my camera with me
&gt;&gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt;&gt; the photo though.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Could it be a resultant of interbreeding and is it confined to a
&gt;&gt;&gt; particular
&gt;&gt;&gt; region perhaps?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Regards,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
