      <p>NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 6th May 2014<br>
<br>
Dear All,<br>
On 6th May, Heather Elkins, Adam Kennedy and myself met up at the Main<br>
Gate to Nairobi National Park about 6.45am, and Karen Plumbe kindly<br>
provided the transport for our full day in the Park.<br>
<br>
It had not rained overnight, but the roads were terrible with jams on<br>
both Magadi Road and Langata Road, causing our late arrival. We<br>
entered the gate and went to KWS Mess, primarily for Suni for Adam, as<br>
it turned out as a very rare event, there were no signs of Suni, and<br>
no birds of interest apart from a pair of Pale Flycatchers. Ivory<br>
Burning Site was equally uninteresting, there was an Emerald Cuckoo en<br>
route, and a strange sight here was a Suni!!!!<br>
<br>
By now it was very overcast and dull, and starting to sprinkle, it<br>
continued like this on and off for much of the day, clearing<br>
mid-afternoon, and there was a heavy downpour as we left Eland Hollow.<br>
<br>
In the drift at Nagalomon Dam were a pair of Spotted Thicknees, whilst<br>
at the dam were another three. Also here there were two Darters, a<br>
Squacco Heron, Yellow-billed Duck, a female Little Sparrowhawk flew<br>
through, a single Swamphen fed along the edge, but the prize was a<br>
female Painted-snipe.<br>
<br>
