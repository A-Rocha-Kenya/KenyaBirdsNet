  <p><span>I would be grateful if somebody could confirm the identity of the two birds and comment on my Black Cuckoo-shrike observation.</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>My first query is a nightjar seen in the Mara, roosting on a hippo path beside a river&nbsp;with quite thick vegetation and trees at the beginning of August this year.&nbsp; When the bird flew it revealed white sides to the tail and also strong white markings on the wings although it all happened so quickly that I could not be certain of what was where.&nbsp; I think it was a square-tailed nightjar but my photo does not seem to fit with the images in the bird guides that I have looked in.</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>My second query is a Cuckoo - I suspect that it is a female Common Cuckoo but again my observations and images do not seem to fit with the bird guides, and also I don&#39;t think it ought to be in Nairobi yet !&nbsp; I have seen it for the first time on Saturday 30th August in Rosslyn, Nairobi feasting on fat hairy caterpillars.</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>Finally, also in my Rosslyn garden, I am seeing what I am sure is a black Cuckoo-shrike but it has no other colours or markings at all.&nbsp; No yellow gape or shoulder but it is associating with another bird that looks like a female BCS.&nbsp; Is this unusual - I see there was a thread earlier about BCS but I was uncertain if they were referring to just the lack of a yellow shoulder or also no yellow gape.</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>If this is the wrong group to be referring this type of question please feel free to redirect me to the correct place.</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>regards</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>Ben</span></p>
