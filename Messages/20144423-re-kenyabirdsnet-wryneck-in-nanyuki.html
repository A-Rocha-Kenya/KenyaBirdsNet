&gt; Saw a red throated wryneck on the grounds of Cape chestnut should anyone
&gt; want to try to see her / him. Had a mountain greenbul also at our place at
&gt; burguret which was a first for our list there.
&gt; On the subject of storks I forgot to report the incredible numbers I saw
&gt; during the 10 to 4 Mt bike race. Thousands roosting in the ngare ndare and
&gt; foraging in the wheat by day. I hope their stay with our brothers in Lebanon
&gt; goes ok but I must say i still dismay after seeing videos like the one Bryan
&gt; shared. Cheers jamie
