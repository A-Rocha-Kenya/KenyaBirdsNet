  <pre>Hi Chege,
Thanks for the info on the Leeser Jacanas breeding at Molo. Is this
the swampy area with the background of the railway bridge, on the road
towards Molo from Njoro?
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Hi Brian
&gt; Nice to hear from you and thanks for your notes on the sunbird.
&gt; Yes the Piapiacs are still in the rubbish is in Mumia.....just around
&gt; the town opposite the the Mumias Sugar Company&#39;s main gate. They were
&gt; two though.
&gt;
&gt; Great spotting of the Lesser Jacanas. Two year ago they had chicks in
&gt; Molo and in fact now seen twice with chicks. Then the open farm past
&gt; your jacana dam last year in August had a Red-chested Flufftail
&gt; Good day

&gt;&gt;Hi Chege,
&gt;&gt;And a very Happy New Year to you. The Mumias Piapiacs are still on the
&gt;&gt;rubbish tip?
&gt;&gt;In the past before the wholesale destruction of the habitat, I used to
&gt;&gt;see Superb Sunbird at Mungatsi with some regularity. The last Superb I
&gt;&gt;have seen in Kenya is at Alupe where there is still a lot of habitat
&gt;&gt;suitable for them, but that sighting was four years ago, and I don&#39;t
&gt;&gt;think there has been one recorded in Kenya since.
&gt;&gt;Best for now

&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi all
&gt;&gt; &gt; Just to report that while guiding for Exotic Birding on 1 Dec at
&gt;&gt; &gt; river Mungatsi we had a male Superb Sunbird. The dark maroon on the
&gt;&gt; &gt; belly to side running down the flanks were quite visible especially
&gt;&gt; &gt; when the bird came out in the light. We had him for about a dozen
&gt;&gt; &gt; minutes and occasionally he came out to the sunlight otherwise bigger
&gt;&gt; &gt; portion of the time spent watching him, he fed right inside the tree
&gt;&gt; &gt; bushes where canopy seemed thick. Frequently he raised a blue crest
&gt;&gt; &gt; kind off at the back from the top of the nape reminding me the old
&gt;&gt; &gt; punk hairstyle. Non of us had brought the camera on the walk but at
&gt;&gt; &gt; lunch having picnic i went back to the same place and spend about
&gt;&gt; &gt; 30min in search but in vain.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Same day we had 2 Piapiacs at Mumias and the previous day we had a
&gt;&gt; &gt; Black-billed Turaco in Kakamega Forest
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Cheers and best wishes for the year 2014
&gt;&gt; &gt; chege
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; With Kind Regards
