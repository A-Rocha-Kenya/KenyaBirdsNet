  <pre>Hi Brian,

Yes... Have also looked at it a bit more as well and whilst the first 
image has more the jizz of a White-backed, in fact the second image is 
less so and your comments on the detail of the plumage make a lot of sense!

White-faced Whistler...

&gt; Hi Colin,
&gt; I must admit that I did not spend much time with the duck image, so I
&gt; downloaded it again and had another look. I still came to the same
&gt; thoughts though, that of a young White-faced Whistling Duck.
&gt; My reasons were that on looking at Doris&#39;s images, a White-backed that
&gt; age would be showing signs of tiger-banding on back and probably on
&gt; the flanks. This bird shows a uniform back with no indication of any
&gt; pattern forming, even the rump should be barred for White-backed.
&gt; White-backed ducklings still show a white blaze at the base of the
&gt; bill from an early age (younger than this bird) like adults, but there
&gt; is no sign of this here. White-backed have pale underparts but with
&gt; dark barring, but already the unmarked dark maroon breast of WFWD is
&gt; present on this bird. The flanks show the start of the fine barring on
&gt; each breast feather of WFWD, that at a distance look vermiculated,
&gt; White-backs progress from uniform flanks to banded, but not
&gt; vermiculated. On the image of the bird out of the water, you can see
&gt; the pattern of WFWD more clearly.
&gt; The images also give the impression of a bird having been diving, but
&gt; young Whistling Ducks habitually dive for food but maybe less
&gt; elegantly than a normal diving duck.
&gt; That it why I still opt for the WFWD option,
&gt; Best for now

&gt;&gt; Jizz looks much more like a White-backed Duck, Brian... Haven&#39;t checked
&gt;&gt; in the books what a juv looks like, but that would be my immediate take
&gt;&gt; on it...

&gt;&gt;&gt; This is a young White-faced Whistling-Duck, they must have bred there,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear All,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Found this duck at Nguuni NS (North of Mombasa) a few days ago &amp;
&gt;&gt;&gt; would be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; happy if somebody could help to identify it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Due to the fading sunlight shortly before sunset I couldn&#39;t get a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; better
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; photo!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you &amp;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Greetings
