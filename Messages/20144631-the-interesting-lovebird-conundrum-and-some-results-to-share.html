  <pre>Dear All,
Because I was getting way out of my depth in the Lovebird issue, I
wrote to a professional Evolutionary Biologist in the US, sending him
all of the files and correspondence relevant to this issue.


I have now received his very interesting response to the documentation
supplied….

Hi Brian,
I&#39;m very sorry for the delay. …..
I can give you a general assessment of how I would view the
circumstances according to
the evidence you&#39;ve gathered, but I&#39;m sure I haven&#39;t yet absorbed all
of the details, so
hopefully I won&#39;t be too wrong about some of it.
