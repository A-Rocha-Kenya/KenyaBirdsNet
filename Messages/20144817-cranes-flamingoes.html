<body class='hmmessage'><div dir='ltr'>A friend of mine who lives out near Athi River has seen large groups of Grey-crowned Cranes (still prefer the Golden-crested name better). The group today numbered 43. I believe he saw 30-some before that, sometime last week. Today they were gathered by a large pond on one of the ranches out there. Is this normal and is it related to rains &amp; breeding, or perhaps migratory movements? <br><br>Also, where would one go these days to see large #'s of Flamingoes? With all the Rift Lakes being so high recently, are the usual sites of Elementeita, Nakuru, and Bogoria any better or worse than Magadi? Some friends are coming out in June/July and would like to see the large flocks of flamingoes if possible. <br><br>Thanks!<br><br>Jeff<br> 		 	   		  </div></body>
