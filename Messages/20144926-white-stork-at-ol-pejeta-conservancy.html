  Dear Birders,<br><br>Greetings and hope this finds you all well.<br>For birders, Christmas gifts came early at the Conservancy with a large flock of migrants - White Stork. A total counts of 93 Storks some resting while other keenly walking as they feed which somehow left Black-winged Lapwing wondering what mission the huge &#39;black and white feathered&#39; had in Lapwing&#39;s territory.<br><br>Attached are two photos of the storks and one for Black-winged Lapwing<br><br>Happy birding festive season.<br>Best regards,<br><br>Joshua Wambugu <br><p><span><br class="yui-cursor"></span></p>
