  <pre>Greetings birders

In April a two-week bird survey was carried out in Boni and Dodori National
Reserves and the Awer Community Conservancy between them, in the extreme
eastern corner of Kenya. The expedition was led by John Musina of the
National Museums of Kenya, sponsored by the Zoological Society of London,
and coordinated by World Wide Fund for Nature, in partnership with National
Museums of Kenya, Kenya Wildlife Service, Northern Rangelands Trust, A Rocha
Kenya and Nature Kenya.
 
The Boni and Dodori National Reserves and Awer Community Conservancy
comprise diverse habitats, ranging from coastal forest, dense thicket and
acacia woodland to a scenic mosaic of palm savanna, grassland and groves of
trees and shrubs. Small seasonal and semi-permanent wetlands dot the sandy
landscape, and now, in the rainy season, much of the area is likely to
become extensively flooded. African Fish Eagles turned up in nearly every
habitat in April, presumably anticipating the rains.
 
Boni-Dodori is proposed as an Important Bird Area, as it shelters
populations of threatened bird species as well as 16 of the 30 species of
the East African Coast biome. The threatened birds seen in April include -
Near-threatened: Southern Banded Snake Eagle, Bateleur, Crowned Eagle,
Martial Eagle, Fischer¹s Turaco, Plain-backed Sunbird, Malindi Pipit and
Eurasian Roller. Vulnerable: Lappet-faced and White-headed Vultures.
Endangered: Basra Reed Warblers on migration.

Birding highlights included seeing the brilliant all-red Juba race of the
Red-headed Weaver building a nest in the village, and many males of the
white-bellied race of the Variable Sunbird feeding on Combretum flowers;
comparing Northern Brownbuls and Terrestrial Brownbuls caught in mist nets;
and watching Amur Falcons, Eurasian Hobbies and Eurasian Rollers flying
north in large numbers.
 
Over 225 species of birds were seen, heard or caught in mist-nets, ringed
and released. These included characteristic coastal forest birds such as
Forest Batis, Tiny Greenbul and Red-tailed Ant Thrush. The mystery of the
Red-naped Bush Shrike with no (or hardly any) red nape was investigated;
three birds were caught and photos, measurements and tissue samples taken.

This new IBA, however, is already under threat. There is a land rush,
because of the area¹s proximity to the LAPSSET project. Oil and gas deposits
have been found offshore, in the area of Kiangwe. A wide new road is being
cleared through the Dodori National Reserve.
 
To protect their land and resources, the Awer (Boni) people set up the Awer
Community Conservancy with help from the Northern Rangelands Trust. WWF is
working with the Awer people on livelihood improvement and habitat
conservation. The Awer people, NGOs and government conservation agencies,
however, now face an uphill struggle to mitigate the threats that come with
the land rush.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
