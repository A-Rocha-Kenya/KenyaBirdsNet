  <pre>Hi Marlene,

Simon saw an Albatros out at sea on Friday 24th January, the first one we have seen 
for ages. The usual Albatros we get here is the Shy. We used to see them regularly 
from about August onwards and Don Turner was out with Pat on one occasion and 
had one right up to the boat, they were throwing fish to it and he identified it as a 
Shy. Pat also saw a Masked Booby in the first week of January.

&gt;  
&gt; Bird Walkon 18th Jan at Haller Park: South Quarry:
&gt; 
&gt; First bird was African Fish Eagle flying overhead but the quarry was pretty quiet. The ponds seem 
&gt; to be somewhat polluted and water birds were few. In fact a tidal puddle was more interesting 
&gt; with Three banded Plovers, Ringed Plover (unusual away from the beach), Little Stints and 
&gt; African Pied Wagtails. The only other migrant wader was a solitary Common Sandpiper at one of 
&gt; the ponds; a splendid Malachite Kingfisher did give us all a very good view. Purple Heron taking 
&gt; off was just a brief glimpse. As there was so little about and as we were being harassed by a very 
&gt; determined male Giraffe, tact seemed to be the better part of valour and so we adjourned to 
&gt; Haller Park. There we saw another 15 species which included Black Capped Night Heron, African 
&gt; Harrier Hawk, two more African Fish Eagles (one may have been the one seen earlier) Giant 
&gt; Kingfisher, another common Sand and an amazing 4 Black Herons who very obligingly did their 
&gt; umbrella fishing together right in the eye of Doris&#39;s camera. A total of 34 species in all.
&gt; 
&gt; Last week spending 5 days at Tiwi Beach was very happy to see for the first time in ages a good 
&gt; number of migrant waders. They all seemed to be in species groups: 60-70 Grey Plovers, 18 
&gt; Whimbrels, large group of Great with a few Lesser Sand Plovers, a couple of Little Stints and 2 or 
&gt; 3 Ruddy Turnstones. Latter 2 groups I just saw once and then in ones and twos but the Plovers 
&gt; stayed together all the time and moved up and down the beach together; maybe they are 
&gt; preparing to migrate? Lots of large shoals of small fish jumping so a delight to watch the Lesser 
&gt; Creaster Terns feeding. Best birding I have had at the beach for ages.
&gt; 
&gt; Today was delighted to wake to the sound of Carmine Bee-eaters feeding over Tudor Creek, a 
&gt; very rare event. What better way to start the week!
&gt; 
&gt; Did anyone manage to ID Doris&#39;s duck? Best guess I could come up with was Northern 
&gt; Shoveler. Would love to hear from some more expert birder.
&gt; 
&gt; Have heard there has been a sighting of an Albatross around Likoni and just got a text from a 
&gt; Shanzu resident that it has been seen there. He was IDing it as a &#39;Wandering&#34; but according to 
&gt; book that seems unlikely. Anyone on Birdsnet at the Coast - please keep an eye open and a bino 
&gt; ready.
