&gt; Good news, the NEMA boss just called me to tell me that after an inspection they issued a stop order as no 
&gt; EIA or stakeholder consultation has taken place. Hopefully this is a new opportunity to engage with and 
&gt; support KWS in improvements - afterall we are their customers and the rightful owners of the park.

&gt;     &#34;While Kenya has not been a White Rhino range state in the last two 
&gt;     hundred years; evidence from fossils and cave paintings in Kenya and 
&gt;     northern Tanzania suggests that the White Rhinoceros, presumably 
&gt;     similar 
&gt;     to the northern race (C. s. cottoni), was widespread and a part of the 
&gt;     East African savanna fauna until 3,000 years ago or less (M. Leakey 
&gt;     pers. comm.), when it was probably displaced by pastoralists who could 
&gt;     easily kill such tame animals (Brett RA [ed] 1993). This is based on the 
&gt;     White Rhino subfossil documented by Maeve Leakey from 3,000 year 
&gt;     from 
&gt;     Rift Valley (Lake Nakuru area). Thus at one stage Kenya was once a 
&gt;     White 
&gt;     Rhino range state (subspecies unknown) and hence the White Rhino as 
&gt;     a 
&gt;     species but not C. s. simum as a subspecies has probably been 
&gt;     reintroduced to Kenya (with the latter being an introduction of a 
&gt;     probable out of range subspecies). A recent report of a white rhino 
&gt;     hunting trophy from Kenya in an Austrian Museum still has to be 
&gt;     confirmed but merits further investigation.&#34;

&gt; Hi Tom,
&gt; I believe that the Oribi came from the Krugers Farm at Eldoret some
&gt; years ago when the habitat was under threat. Oribi have not been a
&gt; native to the area, but of course are found both in the west and the
&gt; east where they are common at Kipini on the coast.
&gt; At least they are a native Kenyan mammal which cannot be said for 
&gt; White Rhino,

&gt; &gt; Are Oribi Ourebia ourebi also an &#39;introduced species&#39; to Nairobi 
&gt; National
&gt; &gt; Park? I thought that this species was brought into NNP from SW 
&gt; Kenya (i.e.,
&gt; &gt; O. o. cottoni).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am not aware of any earlier records of Oribi for the Nairobi area. 
&gt; Are
&gt; &gt; there any such records?

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Dear Paula and all,
&gt; &gt; This is horrifying, and shows why we have to keep an eye on 
&gt; actions
&gt; &gt; taken by KWS in all sorts of their underhand manners, as you said 
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; your previous correspondence they are so secretive in what they 
&gt; do. Of
&gt; &gt; course what they do is completely illegal, and it&#39;s time that the
&gt; &gt; conservationist minded public were fully aware of the mishandling 
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; Nairobi National Park. It&#39;s so difficult nowadays to write anything
&gt; &gt; complementary about KWS in Nairobi, but I suppose there must be
&gt; &gt; something somewhere.
&gt; &gt; From my own standpoint the integrity of Nairobi National Park as a
&gt; &gt; reserve for native wildlife was breached when (and I am sure only 
&gt; for
&gt; &gt; a tourist attraction) White Rhinos were introduced to the Park. As
&gt; &gt; Kenya has never been the home for these beasts, (which I am very 
&gt; fond
&gt; &gt; of by the way), they have as little right to call NNP home as House
&gt; &gt; Crows in Mombasa, they are an exotic, never native to Kenya and 
&gt; should
&gt; &gt; not have been introduced into what up to then was a natural 
&gt; ecosystem
&gt; &gt; as far as mammalian species were concerned.
&gt; &gt; Had the White Rhinos not had been introduced, we would probably 
&gt; not
&gt; &gt; have had the associated problems that we have now, with them 
&gt; being a
&gt; &gt; magnet to poachers. They can only bring us trouble and the time is 
&gt; now
&gt; &gt; to relocate them in a safe area elsewhere.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Do you know that on Sunday, with Fleur and some visitors, we 
&gt; were
&gt; &gt; birding along the Cheetah Gate Road. We have always been 
&gt; exceedingly
&gt; &gt; suspicious of the great area of land along the Mbagathi in that little
&gt; &gt; visited SE corner, being fenced off. Whilst I don&#39;t think that
&gt; &gt; anything honest from KWS has satisfactorily explained the fencing 
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; this portion of the Park, now the road to Cheetah Gate has been
&gt; &gt; blocked with the electric fence continuing across the road from the
&gt; &gt; Cement Factory. This definitely looks like an Illegal Excision of a
&gt; &gt; large part of the Park to me, what do others feel?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Then of course there is the mystery fence at the back of Hyena 
&gt; Dam,
&gt; &gt; another Excision?, and what about the Pylons????
&gt; &gt; Best to all

&gt; &gt;&gt; Dear friends,
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I was horrified today to see that KWS have started fencing off a 
&gt; huge
&gt; &gt;&gt; piece
&gt; &gt;&gt; of the Nairobi National Park for the major expansion of the Nairobi
&gt; &gt;&gt; Orphanage. See attached photo. The fence follows the main road 
&gt; from the
&gt; &gt;&gt; entrance all the way to the club house - which is almost to the 
&gt; ivory
&gt; &gt;&gt; burn
&gt; &gt;&gt; site.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I am writing to request that you help me to demand an immediate 
&gt; halt
&gt; &gt;&gt; these
&gt; &gt;&gt; plans. I have identified the following arguments; you may have 
&gt; others
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; 1. Expanding the orphanage violates the very original purpose of 
&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; orphanage - to home orphans and act as a half way house before 
&gt; they are
&gt; &gt;&gt; released. The orphanage was never intended as a zoo which is 
&gt; what it
&gt; &gt;&gt; seems
&gt; &gt;&gt; KWS wants to create. The Safari Walk on the other hand was 
&gt; created as a
&gt; &gt;&gt; zoo
&gt; &gt;&gt; - there is no need for two zoos in the same place in Nairobi. 
&gt; Moreover,
&gt; &gt;&gt; wilderness in the National Park should not be sacrificed for the 
&gt; creation
&gt; &gt;&gt; of or expansion of a zoo, instead a wholesome education 
&gt; experience
&gt; &gt;&gt; through
&gt; &gt;&gt; visitation to the park should be promoted as it is far more 
&gt; valuable.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; 2. The area for expansion will require the destruction of a sizeable
&gt; &gt;&gt; piece
&gt; &gt;&gt; of Nairobi Park. We are not aware of any EIA having been 
&gt; conducted, nor
&gt; &gt;&gt; are we aware of any stakeholder consultation having taken place. 
&gt; As you
&gt; &gt;&gt; know, FoNNaP which is 19 years old, has always defended the 
&gt; park and
&gt; &gt;&gt; although our board meets regularly with the warden, there has 
&gt; been no
&gt; &gt;&gt; consultation of these plans, and we have not been informed of 
&gt; these or
&gt; &gt;&gt; any
&gt; &gt;&gt; other plans for developments in the park.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; 3. We believe that these developments are in violation of the 
&gt; management
&gt; &gt;&gt; plan of the park which is already out of date having expired a few 
&gt; years
&gt; &gt;&gt; ago. It is also therefore a violation of the new Act which requires 
&gt; parks
&gt; &gt;&gt; to have management plans that are developed through a 
&gt; stakeholder
&gt; &gt;&gt; consultative process.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; 4. The area of land that is being fenced off will result in the
&gt; &gt;&gt; destruction
&gt; &gt;&gt; of highly endangered tropical highland forest including habitats for
&gt; &gt;&gt; endangered add endangered species, as well as species of 
&gt; concern
&gt; &gt;&gt; including
&gt; &gt;&gt; lions, jackals, leopard, Crowned eagle (one of the only 2 nesting 
&gt; pairs
&gt; &gt;&gt; in
&gt; &gt;&gt; Nairobi nests in these trees), Suni, duiker, black rhino and forest 
&gt; hog
&gt; &gt;&gt; all
&gt; &gt;&gt; live in this part of the forest. I am sure there are also plants, birds
&gt; &gt;&gt; and other animals that will also be threatened. By degrading this 
&gt; habitat
&gt; &gt;&gt; and alienating it from the park the KWS will be violating the 
&gt; EMCA, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; failure to consult the stakeholders is in violation of the 
&gt; constitution.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I have written to the Director KWS, NEMA Director and the CS to
&gt; &gt;&gt; respectfully request the immediate halt to the ongoing fencing of 
&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; park,
&gt; &gt;&gt; as it is not too late to restore any damage already caused.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I have also asked for an investigation to be initiated into how this
&gt; &gt;&gt; proposal was developed and passed without any stakeholder 
&gt; consultation or
&gt; &gt;&gt; EIA.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Please help by sending your own letter to the Cabinet Secretary, 
&gt; KWS
&gt; &gt;&gt; Director (Director@kws.org) and NEMA DG 
&gt; &lt;gmwahungu@gmail.com&gt;on this
&gt; &gt;&gt; issue
&gt; &gt;&gt; so that they can see how serious this is.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
