    Thanks, Neil - I know that caged lovebirds were released from cages
    in Malindi about 15 years ago by the guy who ran the croc farm there
    (and who was apparently a KWS Honorary Warden!!!). He proudly told
    me and showed me the boxes he'd put up for them to come and roost in
    - but was sad that they hadn't really come in very much... There are
    lovebirds nesting in building cavities around Malindi now - probably
    offspring from those that were released.<br>
