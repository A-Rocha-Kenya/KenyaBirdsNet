  <pre>Dear Martin,
A very nice photograph, but i am afraid it is a juvenile Great
Sparrowhawk and not an Ovampo. Look at the long graduated tail, and
the overall size etc.
Thanks for sharing the image with us,
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Hello Birders,
&gt; I encountered this sparrowhawk two weeks ago at Wasini Island as it tried to
&gt; catch a chicken. I identified it as a Juvenile Ovambo Sparrowhawk mainly due
&gt; to the prominent eye stripe, dark eyes. I was not able to get a good look at
&gt; the toes. Can anyone confirm my id? I don&#39;t know if there are many sightings
&gt; of this species from the coast, it&#39;s definitely my first at the coast.
&gt;
&gt; Best,
&gt; Martin
