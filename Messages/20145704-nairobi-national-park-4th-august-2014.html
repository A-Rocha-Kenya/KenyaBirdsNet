  <pre>NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 4th August 2014

Dear All,
Karen Plumbe, Fleur Ng’Weno, Jennufer Oduori and myself all met up at
Main Gate at 6.45am. The passage through the gate was speedy and
efficient. There were some Meyer’s Parrots calling.

It was an extremely gloomy morning, and there had been some drizzle
earlier on, but no proper rain. It stayed overcast for most of our
time in the Park.

We decided that we would give KWS Mess Garden a miss, and go straight
to Ivory Burning Site. From when we entered just to IBS, we had no
less than nine Suni on the road, and a tenth at the site. It was not
very birdy, there were numerous Grosbeak Weavers still leaving their
roost in Nagalomon Dam, and five Golden-breasted with one
Cinnamon-breasted Bunting feeding on the grass. There was a nice adult
Great Sparrowhawk sitting up in a tree.
