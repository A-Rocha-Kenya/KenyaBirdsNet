&gt;
&gt; Very interesting ringing recovery...question though..do you think it
&gt; migrated at all, or perhaps stayed in Nairobi throughout 2013 till now ??

&gt;
&gt; Hi Birders and Ringers. on tuesday 28/01/14 at Nairobi ringing we ring 22
&gt; individuals from 12 species, 5 were migrants (1 willow warbler, 2 Blackcap
&gt; and 2 Garden warblers). This was the happiest day for Nairobi ringing
&gt; group,
&gt; why? We capture major site control of Garden warbler sylivia borin (ring
&gt; No.
&gt; k72255) which was ringed here on 29/01/2013 this means it&#39;s exactly the
&gt; same
&gt; time and location, the bird was a year ago; interesting
&gt;
