  <pre>Dear All,
James Culverwell has already sent in images he has taken from Manga
Gardens near the International School.  Out of seven images, five are
of the unidentified form, one is a perfect Kikuyu, and one leans
towards Abyssinian, there is definitely no intrusion breaking the
eye-ring, and the birds are yellow.
I have attached the two singles, and just one of the unknowns,
Best for now
Brian
