  <pre>It sure turned into one of the great ones. I am writing to Bill Clark
on the Vulture and copying you in. Very much looking forward to seeing
the images. When you send it to the net, can you please include me as
a cc as well.

I have suffered these vultures for far to long, it has to get sorted
once and for all.

Best for now
Brian

&gt;&gt; Dear All,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 26th May 2014
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; ….and so it was now 5.40pm and we were hurrying towards the Langata
&gt;&gt; Gate to be checked out by 6.00pm. A quick check of the small Langata
&gt;&gt; Forest Dam not far from the gate rewarded us with a very nice
&gt;&gt; Madagascar Pond Heron, and an extremely attractive breeding plumaged
&gt;&gt; extravert Lesser Moorhen. Leaving here although now only one and a
&gt;&gt; half kilometres for the gate we stopped at the small bridge over the
&gt;&gt; Mokoyeti River, and there peering at us from under the cover of the
&gt;&gt; overhanging vegetation was a sub-adult Black Stork (it’s 26th
&gt;&gt; May!!!!), and within another minute we were on time exiting Langata
&gt;&gt; Gate.
&gt;&gt; That is how our day in Nairobi National Park finished with a bang, but
&gt;&gt; now back to the start…..
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It had been dry the past few days and the rains have so far let us
&gt;&gt; down rather badly, but the traffic along Magadi Road and on to Langata
&gt;&gt; Road was rather light, and we managed to get from my house to the Main
&gt;&gt; Entrance of Nairobi National Park in less than ten minutes.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Here Adam Kennedy, Karen Plumbe kindly acting as the days chauffeur
&gt;&gt; and myself met up with Jennifer Oduori, and we were processed through
&gt;&gt; the gate by 6.50am.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Being a dull day, we could not build up the enthusiasm to visit the
&gt;&gt; KWS Mess gardens which of late have not been too rewarding, and so
&gt;&gt; opted for Ivory Burning Site complete with new incredibly hideous
&gt;&gt; monument designed by people with no knowledge of art or beauty. If you
&gt;&gt; find this comment a little harsh, then I suggest you pay a personal
&gt;&gt; visit to this new addition. Birdwise, nothing happening at all, so we
&gt;&gt; boarded for Nagalomon Dam, with a Spotted Thick-knee in the drift, and
&gt;&gt; another two on the waters edge. There was a young Jacobin Cuckoo along
&gt;&gt; the causeway, on the “island” were many Long-tailed Cormorants with a
&gt;&gt; young Great, and a male Darter. Just one Black-crowned Night-Heron was
&gt;&gt; in the trees.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Leaving here we set off on the back road to Hyena Dam (which now
&gt;&gt; doesn’t get there because of the new swamp), it was quiet on the road
&gt;&gt; with a Slender Mongoose running along ahead of us and the first of so
&gt;&gt; many Sunis today, an African Firefinch was in full voice, a pair of
&gt;&gt; Brown Parrots were in the fig, and a Laughing Dove was unusual in this
&gt;&gt; part of the Park. The new swamp was not the same with no palearctic
&gt;&gt; waders seen all day, African Water Rails called from concealment,
&gt;&gt; there were two Yellow-billed Ducks and eight Red-billed Teal and that
&gt;&gt; was it. We retraced our route back and headed to Hyena Dam. Four
&gt;&gt; Egyptian Mongooses were playing in the road shortly before the dam,
&gt;&gt; however they were all adult sized, and two lionesses were in the
&gt;&gt; grass.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It was quiet at Hyena Dam, not the hive of activity we had been used
&gt;&gt; to in the past few months. There were a number of Plain Martins
&gt;&gt; feeding over the water, and a late Barn Swallow joined them and six
&gt;&gt; Banded Martins also came in for a brief period. Water Rails were
&gt;&gt; calling from the typha but stayed in cover. Following the creek we
&gt;&gt; found the small Great Egret, and were delighted to see that the pair
&gt;&gt; of Long-toed Plovers are still present.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Now heading out to Karen Primary School Dam we had a young
&gt;&gt; white-headed Martial Eagle on the run-off, the first of six
&gt;&gt; Black-shouldered Kites, and the first of six Secretarybirds. In the
&gt;&gt; grass were many Cisticolas, a Red-faced sang along the Mokoyeti and
&gt;&gt; there were a few Orange-breasted Waxbills. Just beyond Lone Tree a
&gt;&gt; very late Black Stork was seen flying in the distance, it seemed to
&gt;&gt; have a black neck. The bird in the evening near Langata Gate had a
&gt;&gt; buff head and upper neck and did not look the same individual but to
&gt;&gt; have two Black Storks in the Park at this time of year would be to say
&gt;&gt; the least extraordinary (just one is!).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Karen Primary School Dam still had the large young Spur-winged Goose,
&gt;&gt; and Eland Hollow held on to its African Jacana, and the usual Hippo.
&gt;&gt; Continuing in the direction of Athi Dam we found a nice male Namaqua
&gt;&gt; Dove right out in the plains, several Rosy-breasted Longclaws, a
&gt;&gt; Long-billed Pipit, a scattering of Quail-finch, but the biggest
&gt;&gt; surprise was a party of six Cut-throats, only the second documented
&gt;&gt; record for the Park.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; There were three Chandler’s Reedbucks resting in their usual place,
&gt;&gt; and soon we arrived at the murrum pits at the top of Athi Basin. The
&gt;&gt; vultures were in, there were 37 White-backed and nine Ruppell’s and a
&gt;&gt; bird that looked like an immature Eurasian Griffon Vulture (see image
&gt;&gt; attached). There was a pair of White-bellied Bustards, that were our
&gt;&gt; only bustards of the day.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; At the top of the descent road was a male, collared Lion. Athi Dam is
&gt;&gt; not quite as interesting now the palearctics have departed, leaving
&gt;&gt; just one lone White Stork. There were some eighty Marabous which
&gt;&gt; entertained us for a while. Three were in extremely attractive (if you
&gt;&gt; could imagine it possible), breeding plumage. The birds were big, and
&gt;&gt; yet we were surrounded with what appeared to be undersized Marabous.
&gt;&gt; Are there any populations of small Marabous that might be visiting us,
&gt;&gt; because the size difference was dramatic? Other birds present were an
&gt;&gt; adult Pink-backed Pelican, eight African Spoonbills, a pair of
&gt;&gt; Yellow-billed Duck, eight Spur-winged and fifteen Kittlitz’s Plovers,
&gt;&gt; and a new high of eleven Speckled Pigeons. On the causeway five
&gt;&gt; Black-crowned Night-Herons roosted in the trees and whilst we had our
&gt;&gt; lunch three Black-faced Sandgrouse came in and drank at the waters
&gt;&gt; edge. This is the fifth record of the species in the Park, and all
&gt;&gt; within the past year. A lone Lesser Masked Weaver fed in the acacias.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Continuing back to the main road from the causeway two of the
&gt;&gt; Sandgrouse were now on the track in front of the car, and no sooner
&gt;&gt; had we turned on to the main road (from Cheetah Gate), there was the
&gt;&gt; first Eastern Chanting Goshawk in the Park for eight years, a
&gt;&gt; beautiful adult attacking a fully hooded Black-necked Spitting Cobra.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Now heading in the direction of the Hippo Pools were the trio of
&gt;&gt; female, teenager and baby Black Rhinos, an attractive pair of
&gt;&gt; Black-faced Waxbills, and there were at least 900 Marabous roosting in
&gt;&gt; the trees along the Mbagathi.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; We were now travelling faster towards Kingfisher, there was an
&gt;&gt; immature (different bird to earlier) Martial Eagle just above Hippo
&gt;&gt; Pools and a Pangani Longclaw near the exit to Maasai Gate. The burnt
&gt;&gt; area was disappointing but we did have two beautiful Cyrtanthus
&gt;&gt; lilies.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Now heading for a departure out of Langate Gate we stopped at the
&gt;&gt; forest edge dam near the gate finding the only Little Grebe of the
&gt;&gt; day, and the Madagascar Pond Heron and Lesser Moorhen which is where
&gt;&gt; this report started.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Mammals were mainly confined to the edge of the Mbagathi River, but
&gt;&gt; species like Zebra and Wildebeest have come back in now it is drying.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; A slow start to a very spectacular day, with species very rarely
&gt;&gt; recorded in the Park, and an easy return by road,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Best to all
&gt;&gt; Brian
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; KEY TO ACCOMPANYING MONTAGE

&gt;&gt; BOTTOM RIGHT CLOSE UP OF GREATER COVERTS.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; OTHERS
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; TOP RIGHT MARABOU STORK
&gt;&gt; This is evidently a comfortable resting position for this individual.
&gt;&gt; It would persistently rest on one leg, whilst the free legs claw would
&gt;&gt; grip the ankle of the supporting leg. Never heard of this before.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; SECOND ROW SECOND FROM RIGHT MARABOU STORK
&gt;&gt; One of the attractive birds in full breeding plumage and very large.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; SECOND ROW FAR RIGHT
&gt;&gt; A cute filler of a family of Bush Hyrax.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; BOTTOM ROW MIDDLE Black Stork
&gt;&gt; The buffy-headed sub-adult near Langata Gate
