I saw a few new species and Kenya-firsts during my time away as well as some of the more interesting regulars. These included:</div><div id="yui_3_16_0_1_1427271928063_23011" dir="ltr"><br></div><div id="yui_3_16_0_1_1427271928063_23011" dir="ltr">At the Ragati I saw a Fine-banded Woodpecker, Brown Woodland Warblers, and some Brown-capped Weavers (that I have seen before).</div><div id="yui_3_16_0_1_1427271928063_23011" dir="ltr"><br></div><div id="yui_3_16_0_1_1427271928063_23011" dir="ltr">In both the Ragati, Aberdares and on Mount Elgon now I have heard a bird calling that I have been unable to identify. It is clearly a skulking/ground favouring species so I am guessing that it is something in the Robin/Chat/Thrush family but I could be wrong. It favours dense forest undergrowth and emits a repetitive high pitched call that is very reminiscent of a cricket calling. Almost Bru-bru like. Any ideas on what this might be?</div><div id="yui_3_16_0_1_1427271928063_23011" dir="ltr"><br></div><div id="yui_3_16_0_1_1427271928063_23011" dir="ltr">In the Podocarpus riverine forest along the Honi River abutting the northern edge of the Aberdare Country Club's land I saw two White-Eared Barbets. There were 5 of us and we all got a good look at the second one as it was sat on a power line in full view for a good 5 minutes with a very obvious white ear and rump. I have never seen these before and I note from the distribution maps in Birds of Kenya by Zimmerman et al that they are not known from here although they are found further north and east.&nbsp;</div><div id="yui_3_16_0_1_1427271928063_23011" dir="ltr"><br></div><div id="yui_3_16_0_1_1427271928063_23011" dir="ltr">In the Aberdare Salient I saw Brown-Chested Alethe on the road below Rhino Retreat. I also saw a Grey-Headed Negro Finch, a first for me in Kenya. I am also convinced that I saw a Common White Throat along the park boundary but the distribution would suggest that these are only found in dry acacia/commiphora woodland below 1200m which is well below the height of the Salient. Any thoughts on this? I didn't get the longest of looks at it but have seen them enough times in the UK to be able to recognise them.&nbsp;</div><div id="yui_3_16_0_1_1427271928063_23011" dir="ltr"><br></div><div id="yui_3_16_0_1_1427271928063_23011" dir="ltr">Best wishes</div><div id="yui_3_16_0_1_1427271928063_23011" dir="ltr"><br></div><div id="yui_3_16_0_1_1427271928063_23011" dir="ltr">Patrick</div></div></body></html>
