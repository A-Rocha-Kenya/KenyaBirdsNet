  <pre>Wow John,
This is very impressive, it should be a bird reserve that tolerates golfers!
Best for now

&gt; *Karen Country Club bird walk, 23 January 2015*
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; On a glorious, sunny, mild morning, myself, Alastair Campbell, Karen
&gt; Plumbe, Sarah Chiles and Barb Schlegel set off to explore the avian
&gt; delights of Karen Country Club. The first sighting was a Silvery-cheeked
&gt; Hornbill, and other “big birds” were to follow.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The wetlands were alive with birds, and it was hard to know where to look
&gt; next. We had clear views of Tropical Boubou, Rueppell’s Robin Chat, Willow
&gt; Warbler and African Citril, and a good sighting of a Grey-headed Kingfisher
&gt; was soon followed by a Giant Kingfisher flying across the reedbeds. Two
&gt; Grey Crowned Cranes flew past emitting their distinctive call. The
&gt; highlight, though, was an immature Purple Heron, the first sighting of that
&gt; species for Karen Club.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; At the dams, the usual Reed Cormorant, Common Sandpiper and Three-banded
&gt; Plovers were joined by three Black-winged Stilts, which treated us to a
&gt; flying display, and a single Green Sandpiper, the first of the season at
&gt; that site. And intriguingly, there were two Yellow-billed Ducks sitting
&gt; next to each other in perfect light, at the same angle to the sun, one with
&gt; an obvious green speculum and the other with an obvious blue speculum. I am
&gt; convinced there are real differences out there, and not just tricks of the
&gt; light.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; On our walk, a number of the “usuals” were strangely absent – no
&gt; Yellow-whiskered Greenbul, or Hamerkop, or Great Cormorant, or barbets, or
&gt; Streaky Seedeater. But we did get excellent views of a flock of 20+ Rock
&gt; Martins mixed with some Plain Martins, as well as Hartlaub’s Turaco, Cape
&gt; Robin Chat and Pale Flycatcher.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The total of 48 species was very satisfying, and we thoroughly deserved our
&gt; bacon and egg baps washed down with coffee.
