  <pre>NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 14th November 2015

Dear All,
Nigel Hunter and myself entered the Main Gate at 6.45am and were
proficiently processed. It was a very gloomy day, and there had been
good rains.

Along the entrance road both Common and Thrush Nightingales were
singing, and were widespread in the northern sector. We first visited
Nagalomon Dam, which was quite full, however it was not supporting
much in the way of birds, possibly some of the reeds are returning but
compared to former self it looks quite naked. There were a Little
Grebe, the only African Spoonbill of the day, Black-crowned
Night-Herons have returned and will no doubt be nesting soon, four
Darters, a sentinel adult Fish Eagle, adult African Jacana, just two
Green Sandpipers and the first of over ten Rosy-breasted Longclaws
encountered today.

We managed to go through the day without a single migrant Warbler or
Spotted Flycatcher, nor any migrant Wagtails and Pipits, the migrants
were abysmal for mid November, even very few Barn Swallows.

As the area at the back of Hyena Dam was impassably muddy, we returned
round to the main road playing safe. At the dam were three Red-billed
Teal, another Little Grebe, an adult Purple Heron, single Great Egret,
another Fish Eagle this time a sub-adult, only one African Water Rail
feeding out in the open, but others heard, two Swamphen, a pair of
Black-winged Stilt, four Long-toed Plovers and one pair mating so it
could be a new county breeding record soon, three Spur-winged Plovers,
an adult and two large young African Jacanas, two Common Snipe, a few
each of Green and Wood Sandpipers, the first of only two Whinchats and
a few Red-collared Widowbirds in the grassland, some in full dress.

We missed out Hyena Run-off and headed to the south-east. On the way
there was a Spotted Thick-knee at Karen PS Dam, whilst the plains had
male and immature Pallid and a male Montagu’s Harrier. Also a pair of
White-bellied Bustards, three Red-tailed Shrikes of which one was a
male Turkestan, just one Banded Martin, the first of four Northern
Wheatears (the only wheatears of the day), six Yellow-crowned Bishop
in non breeding dress, a party of Orange-breasted Waxbills and one
male Parasitic Weaver.

There is water in the murrum pits above Athi Basin and the large hippo
is back in its exposed residence, though no terrapin on its back as
yet. There were two Greenshank here, but nothing else of note. In Athi
Basin were two Kori Bustards, but the Dam was exceedingly
disappointing. It has overfilled and there is no edge any more as it
has reached the grassland. All we had were a few Red-billed Teal, yet
another Little Grebe, one Yellow-billed Stork, a couple of Spur-winged
and solitary Kittlitz’s Plovers, whilst the entire palearctic wader
presence consisted of two each of Greenshank and Common Sandpiper.

We drove out to Cheetah Gate, and were astonished to see that a cable
had dropped from the pylons and was lying on the ground across the
road. There were no sparks flying so it would appear that nothing is
going through at present (just as well!). There was nothing on Rhino
Circuit, but along the Mbagathi were a Steppe Eagle and Martial
Eagles, but the real surprise was a pair of African Hawk-Eagles, rare
enough in NNP but I have never encountered a pair before. Maybe they
are interested in staying in the area, although a Drongo was being
persistent. Additionally were three Chestnut Sparrows and a couple of
Speckled Weavers.

Closer to Hippo Pools, a pair of Lesser Striped Swallows had returned
in stunning breeding dress and were singing from the bushes. As an
interjection our first Lesser Striped Swallow got back to the house on
Friday (20th). I know it was the usual bird because it has a favourite
perch on a projecting branch of a Silky Oak (Grevillea). It sat around
singing but no sign of the female, but she was there with him the
following morning. This is the first Lesser Striped around the house
since 14th August (which is an absence of just over three months),
when the pair suddenly disappeared having fledged two young. It would
be interesting to hear of other observers arrivals and absences.

The southern road was not too exciting, with the days only
Secretarybird on the burnt area and a Pangani Longclaw in the
grassland. At Kingfisher were a few Eurasian Bee-eaters but nothing
else in the migratory line.

We decided to leave via Langata Gate, finding the only pair of Grey
Crowned Cranes of the day below Impala Lookout, the days only Common
Buzzard and a compact flock of forty Greater Blue-eared Starlings
which were flying over. On the vlei near the gate the hoped for pipits
and wagtails did not materialise, the only wader was a Green
Sandpiper, but there was a Saddle-billed Stork which has been
secretive lately. We were through the gate at 3.45pm.

Mammals were in fairly good numbers, Zebra are mainly in the Athi
Basin. There were two White Rhinos near the Beacon, three Lions in
Athi Basin and a pair of Black-backed Jackals at the top of Athi
Basin.

The rains have certainly had an effect on the bird population, with
most dams full, but Hyena Dam still very rewarding.

Best to all
Brian
