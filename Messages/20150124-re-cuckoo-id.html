  <pre>Hi Titus,
Do you have any more images showing undertail-coverts, undertail
pattern and the tips of wings and tail, these are very important
features in Cuckoo ID, but cannot do it from this image,
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Dear Birders,
&gt; I hope all is well with birding. Please help with the id of the attached
&gt; cuckoo. It was taken in Gwassi Hill forest edge in Homabay in mid November.
&gt; Thanks.
