  <pre>Hi Darcy,
That&#39;s a pretty stunning image, was it near the airstrip, as that is
the only area I have seen them in Samburu (on the Buffalo Springs
side),
Best for now

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; Just a couple things to mention.
&gt;
&gt; On 28 November in Nanyuki town there was a flock of circa 100 Open-billed
&gt; Storks passing overhead.
&gt;
&gt; Also on 27 Nov in Samburu NR I photographed a male fire-fronted bishop in
&gt; full breeding plumage.  Image attached.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, Darcy
