  <pre>Greetings birders

A successful waterbird count on Lakes Naivasha, Oloidien and Elmenteita last
weekend, organized by National Museums of Kenya, Kenya Wildlife Service,
Nature Kenya and other partners. Highlights included:

Over 40 African Darters among the cormorants in the flooded trees in our
sector on the south shore of the lake. Some were nesting pairs, others
immatures. I&#39;m told there were nesting pairs last year, too.

African Skimmers seen by other counters on Lakes Elmenteita and Oloidien.

A family of four Southern Ground Hornbills on a farm on the north shore of
the lake. Very happy to see them after many years!

Thanks to all involved, and wishing you good birding, Fleur
