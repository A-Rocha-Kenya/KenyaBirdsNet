I&#39;m a birder from South Africa and will be in Nairobi this weekend.=20

Can anyone suggest some birding locations in and around Nairobi that I can r=
each by taxi and where I can bird on foot safely?

I&#39;m also open to joining a birding excursion further afield if any birders p=
erhaps have space in their vehicle.=20

Many thanks,
David
