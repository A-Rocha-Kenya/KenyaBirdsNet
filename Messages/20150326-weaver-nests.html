  <pre>Hi all

Pieter Cronje has been travelling in Kenya and found some weaver nests 
built on the edge of a thatched roof at Rongai Main Gate. The site was 
not active, so the identification is uncertain. If anyone has seen these 
weavers there before, or is able to visit when the weavers are breeding, 
please let me know the species. Or even better still, take a photo and 
submit a repeat record to PHOWN (PHOtos of Weaver Nests, 
http://weavers.adu.org.za/phown.php)! (see how below).

Photo and details of the nests may be viewed at: 
http://weavers.adu.org.za/phown_vm.php?vm=15557

To upload any weaver nest photos with details on date, place, etc go to 
http://vmus.adu.org.za/ where there are details on how to register and 
take part. You can also browse records and summaries for all our Virtual 
Museum projects.

PHOWN is going very well in Kenya - see a summary of all records at
