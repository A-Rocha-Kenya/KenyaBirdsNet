      <p>Dear All,<br>
Further to my email this morning on visible migration from my time in<br>
our paddock from 6.40-10.45am (apart from breakfast), I returned again<br>
at 3.00pm staying until 5.00pm. It was again interesting  and gave me<br>
good reasons why birders should both look UP whilst birding and of<br>
course the importance of looking DOWN. (See attached).<br>
The first Eurasian Hobby came through, and there were six falcons very<br>
high that were quite likely Amurs. Barn Swallow passage E, the huge<br>
flock of White Pelicans was followed by a smaller flock a haf-hour<br>
later, all heading W to the Rift. Four Tree Pipits were down feeding<br>
but probably were entirely different to the passage birds this<br>
morning. Both of the winter resident Common Buzzards were still<br>
present. Needless to say the DOWN bird was a first for here, there has<br>
only been one NNP record and that in the great drought four years ago,<br>
and only one other Nairobi county record,<br>
Best for now<br>
Brian<br>
