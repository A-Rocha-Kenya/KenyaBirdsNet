The variety of habitats attracts different species of birds, from shrub land,rocky &amp; patches of grasslands. One of the spectacular views of birds I ever saw was Eastern Paradise Whydah, Pin-tailed Whydah,Steel-blue Whydah and a big flock of Red-billed Quelea on their bright plumage on the same tree. Bat hawks making fast hunts before dark will also add your checklist.</div><div id="yui_3_16_0_1_1442564053048_3032" dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to lack of enough rain for vegetation during dry season somali herders from as far as Moyale travels with their camel in to Isiolo-meru area in search of vegetation, they go purchasing Euphombia tirucalli planted around homesteads by Ameru community members. The purchase act as a source of income when there is no crops in their farms.</div><div id="yui_3_16_0_1_1442564053048_3379" dir="ltr"> While recording birds in a company of a local guide we saw a herd of about 250 camels the biggest I had never seen before. Using my binoculars I noticed two of them were doing something strange on a dry leafless Acacia tortilis, at a close range I noticed that they were actually enjoying White-browed Sparrow Weaver's nests, hurriedly picked my phone to capture the moment but wasn't enough! Had a brief conversation with herder who mentioned that the big herbivores will go for the nests whenever they have an opportunity. What happens to eggs and the chics inside the nests??</div><div id="yui_3_16_0_1_1442564053048_3697" dir="ltr">Happy birding,</div><div id="yui_3_16_0_1_1442564053048_3848" dir="ltr">John Gitiri.<br></div><div id="yiv3346069588"><div><div style="color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;"><div id="yiv3346069588"><div><div style="color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
