  <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>October is White-eye month here in Nairobi. This morning we first had a big bunch of Yellow White-eye coming to bathe, often several together.</p>
<p>The eye-ring is only slighty wider on the lower side, crenelated and interrupted by the black lore.</p>
<p>Then a few Montane kikuyuensis came, not as social, usually only a single one on the bath at a time, the group was less large also and less vocal.</p>
<p>The eye-ring is huge and wider on the lower side, the forecrown is bright yellow, the rest of the bird, including the underparts mostly olive, not yellow.</p>
<p>We did not get Abyssinian this morning but a few pics from last year in October (the three birds to the left of the Kikuyensis centrally in the back)</p>
<p>can show that the eye-ring is more uniform in width (and less than the diameter of the eye everywhere), not interrupted by a lore and the birds are</p>
<p>yellowish.  </p>
<p>We are not too sure about the wet bord on the right but I guess it is a Montane (though Brian Finch thinks it might be a Yellow)</p>
<p> </p>

<p>&gt; Dear Neil and Melissa,<br />&gt; The smaller image from Magambua I am sure is Abyssinian. The eye-ring<br />&gt; very narrow, and no-where bisected by the blackish loral line. The<br />&gt; bird from Arusha appears to be Yellow, eye-ring width of eye, and<br />&gt; <br />&gt; clearly bisected by blackish loral line. Yellow White-eye on Mt Meru,<br />&gt; is this something that is known, or are you also having three<br />&gt; sympatric white-eyes there? I'm not at all familiar with eurycricota,<br />&gt; but this bird does not look at all like a member of the Montane group,<br />&gt; Best for now<br />&gt; Brian<br />&gt; <br />&gt; On 10/3/15, Neil and Liz Baker tzbirdatlas@yahoo.co.uk [tanzaniabirds]<br />&gt; &lt;tanzaniabirds@yahoogroups.com&gt; wrote:<br />&gt; &gt;<br />&gt; &gt;<br />&gt; &gt; Melissa is on the edge of the Miombo belt SSE of Singida in Acacia dominated<br />&gt; &gt; habitat with Ashy Starlings.<br />&gt; &gt; So one would expect Abyssinian in this habitat.<br />&gt; &gt; and one would expect Abyssinian as a non-breeding dry season visitor to the<br />&gt; &gt; edge of Arusha NP.<br />&gt; &gt; single birds in edge habitat can be confusing and I'm not at all sure the<br />&gt; &gt; fieldguides have these as well defined as they could be.<br />&gt; &gt; I'll look at the maps again soon.<br />&gt; &gt; NeilNeil and Liz Baker, Tanzania Bird Atlas, P.O.

The photo<br />&gt; &gt; in which the bird is smaller was taken here in Magambua, the other was<br />&gt; &gt; taken near Arusha National Park.  I had thought we had the Yellow<br />&gt; &gt; White-eye here but as I compare the various photos that I have from<br />&gt; &gt; different places, the eye ring seems very small on the photos of the<br />&gt; &gt; Magambua birds and I think we may be just on the edge of the Abyssinian<br />&gt; &gt; White-eye's range.  If it is the Abyssinian, you will need to correct it<br />&gt; &gt; in the records that I have sent you as I think I have it listed at the<br />&gt; &gt; Yellow White-eye on the data sheet. Thanks for your help and again,<br />&gt; &gt; sorry to be bother but want to make sure you have the right info for here.<br />&gt; &gt;<br />&gt; &gt;<br />&gt; &gt; Melissa<br />&gt; &gt;<br />&gt; &gt;<br />&gt; &gt;<br />&gt; &gt;<br />&gt; &gt;<br />&gt;</p>
