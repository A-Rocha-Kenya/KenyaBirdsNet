  <div dir="ltr"><div><div><div><div>Hi All,<br><br></div>I&#39;m interested to learn what this localised form really looks like and would be especially grateful if anyone could share an image or two of it - perhaps in the hand? <br><br></div>A quick heads up on the form involved; it is referred to as race <i>olivaceiceps</i> of Stripe-cheeked Greenbul (<i>Andropadus milanjensis</i>) in Stevenson &amp; Fanshawe but is now separated by some authors as Olive-headed Greenbul (<i>Arizelocichla olivaceiceps</i>), in the same <i>new</i> genus as the various Mountain Greenbuls.<br><br></div><div>I am not looking to use the images for anything other reference material and will not share without expressed permission. <br></div><div><br></div>Many thanks in advance,<br></div>Adam<br><div><div><br><br></div></div></div>
