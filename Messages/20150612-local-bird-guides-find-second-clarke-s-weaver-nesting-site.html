  <pre>Greetings birders

Julio Mwambire and Japhet Garama of Dakatcha Woodland Conservation Group
(DWCG) have found the second confirmed breeding site for Clarke¹s Weavers in
the world. Like the first breeding site, it is in Dakatcha Woodland
Important Bird Area northwest of Malindi.

During monthly bird monitoring organized by Nature Kenya, Mwambire and
Garama recorded large flocks of Clarke¹s Weavers at Munyenzeni wetland near
Bore viewpoint in late April, but no breeding activity.

Then on 9 May 2015, Mwambire and Garama found Clarke&#39;s Weavers building
nests among the sedges in a pool of the seasonal Gandi River.
 
On May 21 and 22, Rupi Mangat, Catherine Ngarachu, Brian Wambua, Albert Baya
and I joined Mwambire, Garama, Peter Wario and Samson Katisho of DWCG on to
view this second Clarke¹s Weaver breeding site. The sedge-filled pool in the
Gandi River was busy with weavers. We could see male and female Clarke¹s
Weavers sitting in the tops of the sedges, and estimated about 80 Clarke¹s
Weaver nests. Some of the birds were shivering their wings, apparently in
display. There were also a number of Grosbeak Weavers with nests, and flocks
of Red-headed and Red-billed Queleas.
 
Male and female Clarke¹s Weavers flew and off and soon returned with food in
their beaks to feed the young in the nests. The adults brought mainly
insects, including caterpillars and grasshoppers. They continued to bring
food all morning, and the next day we watched them bringing food in the
afternoon. 
 
Yesterday, June 11, Julio Mwambire reported &#34;Now young ones flying around
perching on the shrubs in the wetland and the bushes, in small flocks
joining adults flying to the feeding grounds&#34;.

It seems that we can report a successful Clarke&#39;s Weaver breeding event in
Dakatcha Woodland IBA.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
