<BR>
To the best of my knowledge, Clarke&#8217;s Weavers have only been caught and ringed twice &#8211; by John Fanshawe many years ago and by Colin Jackson some years ago.<BR>
<BR>
They are difficult to catch, as they forage mostly in the treetops, and fly fairly straight up out of the sedges where they nest.<BR>
<BR>
So their movements remain a challenging mystery. <BR>
<BR>
For instance, in March this year Albert Baya in Arabuko-Sokoke Forest noted Clarke&#8217;s Weavers flying across the Sabaki towards Dakatcha in the evenings, and back to Arabuko-Sokoke in the mornings. &nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
We still have much to learn!<BR>
<BR>
Best wishes, Fleur<BR>

Hi Fleur,<BR>
<BR>
That is very good news to hear about Clarke's Weaver nesting site.<BR>
<BR>
Have the Clarke's Weavers ever been ringed?<BR>
<BR>
Happy birding.<BR>

Greetings birders<BR>
<BR>
Julio Mwambire and Japhet Garama of Dakatcha Woodland Conservation Group<BR>
(DWCG) have found the second confirmed breeding site for Clarke&sup1;s Weavers in<BR>
the world. Like the first breeding site, it is in Dakatcha Woodland<BR>
Important Bird Area northwest of Malindi.<BR>
<BR>
During monthly bird monitoring organized by Nature Kenya, Mwambire and<BR>
Garama recorded large flocks of Clarke&sup1;s Weavers at Munyenzeni wetland near<BR>
Bore viewpoint in late April, but no breeding activity.<BR>
<BR>
Then on 9 May 2015, Mwambire and Garama found Clarke's Weavers building<BR>
nests among the sedges in a pool of the seasonal Gandi River.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
On May 21 and 22, Rupi Mangat, Catherine Ngarachu, Brian Wambua, Albert Baya<BR>
and I joined Mwambire, Garama, Peter Wario and Samson Katisho of DWCG on to<BR>
view this second Clarke&sup1;s Weaver breeding site. The sedge-filled pool in the<BR>
Gandi River was busy with weavers. We could see male and female Clarke&sup1;s<BR>
Weavers sitting in the tops of the sedges, and estimated about 80 Clarke&sup1;s<BR>
Weaver nests. Some of the birds were shivering their wings, apparently in<BR>
display. There were also a number of Grosbeak Weavers with nests, and flocks<BR>
of Red-headed and Red-billed Queleas.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Male and female Clarke&sup1;s Weavers flew and off and soon returned with food in<BR>
their beaks to feed the young in the nests. The adults brought mainly<BR>
insects, including caterpillars and grasshoppers. They continued to bring<BR>
food all morning, and the next day we watched them bringing food in the<BR>
afternoon. <BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Yesterday, June 11, Julio Mwambire reported &quot;Now young ones flying around<BR>
perching on the shrubs in the wetland and the bushes, in small flocks<BR>
joining adults flying to the feeding grounds&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
It seems that we can report a successful Clarke's Weaver breeding event in<BR>
Dakatcha Woodland IBA.<BR>
<BR>
Wishing you good birding, Fleur<BR>
