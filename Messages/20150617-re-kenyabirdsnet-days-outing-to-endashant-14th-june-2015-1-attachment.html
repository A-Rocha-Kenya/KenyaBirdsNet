  <P>Dear All,<BR>On 14th June, Ben Allen kindly conveyed Fleur Ng&#8217;Weno, 
  Jennifer Oduori<BR>and myself on a local trip to Endashant. This is an 
  excursion that<BR>usually smacks of harassment, outrageous demands by the 
  residents, and<BR>causes bad feeling so at the end of the day you leave not as 
  happy as<BR>you really want to be. Not so on this occasion as I will relate 
  a<BR>little later, we met only the nicest of people and made friends, 
  also<BR>a contact for anyone who wants to camp on our friends site and what 
  a<BR>view.<BR><BR>We met up at Galleria and set off for Ngong, with hardly any 
  traffic<BR>we were through Kibiko and on the edge of the Rift in no time. 
  Amongst<BR>the species we hoped to see here was the race albicaudus 
  of<BR>White-headed Barbet. There were a couple in some figs and they 
  really<BR>spoilt us (see images). Now this is not the same as what we have 
  been<BR>calling White-headed Barbet in Nairobi. That bird is the race 
  senex,<BR>but BirdLife have elevated it to a species Lybius senex, no 
  longer<BR>White-headed Barbet but the birds on the Ngongs are real 
  White-headed<BR>Barbets living mere kilometres from senex. Very unfortunately 
  BirdLife<BR>called the bird Brown-and-White Barbet, could you possibly be any 
  more<BR>boring for such a startling all white bird apart from all 
  blackish<BR>wings and a narrow dark brown line across the upper back, it is 
  now<BR>Snowy Barbet which gives a real description that makes this 
  barbet<BR>unique in the world, the whiteness!<BR>The differences between the 
  albicaudus on the Ngongs (and into the<BR>rift south to Shompole and north to 
  Nakuru, and in west Rift Oloololo<BR>Escarpment in Mara patchily north to 
  Malaba), is that the breast to<BR>lower belly is all dark brown, but this is 
  all pure white in Snowy,<BR>the wings are brown rather than blackish of Snowy, 
  which lacks the<BR>large white blotches on the shoulders and coverts of 
  albicaudus<BR>instead being all uniform dark. Whereas the Snowy has a very 
  thin<BR>brown band across the extreme upper back, albicaudus has 
  an<BR>extensively brown back from just below the nape almost to the start 
  of<BR>the rump. There are claims of hybridisation between the two, but 
  this<BR>seems to be erroneous and the two forms living so close, you 
  would<BR>expect to see a strange mixture, but plumages of each is 
  constant.<BR>Other birds here were Lyne&#8217;s Cisticola, Abyssinian Black Wheatear 
  and<BR>Cardinal Quelea (but they were everywhere and abundant at the 
  swamp).<BR>At the bottom of the hill was a strange sight of a pair of 
  Anteater<BR>Chats! The road was not nearly as bad as anticipated, as this can 
  be a<BR>very difficult road after downpours and we continued to the 
  lava<BR>cliffs just before Endashant. Very birdy, and from the one spot 
  quite<BR>a good representation of chats and thrushes with a showy 
  Bare-eyed<BR>Thrush, White-browed Scrub-Robin, Spotted Morning Thrush, 
  Cape<BR>Robin-Chat, Cliff-Chat and more Abyssinian Black Wheatears. It 
  was<BR>quite a noisy spot! We had a White-headed Saw-wing here, but had 
  them<BR>at two other places during the day, including a group of four. This 
  is<BR>quite an incursion for this western species, six birds in a day 
  would<BR>usually amount to three years of observations around Nairobi in 
  normal<BR>years!<BR><BR>The first marsh at Endashant was a huge sedge bed 
  shallow basin,<BR>Yellow-crowned Bishops found this much to their liking. We 
  met some<BR>herders here, and they were most pleasant, and Jennifer took time 
  to<BR>explain the Pentad Atlas Project. After a short walk we continued 
  on<BR>to the main swamp and spent a couple of hours on the lakeshore. It 
  too<BR>was an enormous sedge bed, but the water was deeper and there 
  were<BR>open patches. Ducks included both Whistling-Ducks, many 
  Red-billed<BR>Teal, half-dozen Yellow-billed and a dozen Knob-bills. But this 
  is a<BR>seasonal wetland and we were too early, after it had not so long 
  ago<BR>been a dry basin it had not had time for all the small organisms 
  to<BR>multiply and was quite sterile. In all the time there we did not 
  hear<BR>or see a frog, the only heron was a Black-headed, the only waders 
  were<BR>a pair each of Blacksmith Plover and African Jacana, and the 
  only<BR>rails were numerous noisy but secretive Common Moorhens. There 
  were<BR>three Crowned Cranes. The sedges though were teaming with 
  Cardinal<BR>Queleas and Yellow-crowned Bishops.<BR>The only dragonflies we saw 
  were the four on the image. But the<BR>standard was very high, and they were 
  resting on fallen acacia twigs<BR>in the shade of an acacia next to an open 
  area of water. The<BR>threesome, top is a young male Broad Scarlet 
  (Crocothemis erythraea),<BR>below this on the left is Barbet (Philonomon 
  luminans) called this in<BR>South Africa because the colour and pattern 
  resemble Crested Barbet,<BR>and right a young male Strong Skimmer (Orthetrum 
  brachiale). The image<BR>to the right from the same place is a male Deceptive 
  Widow<BR>(Palpopleura deceptor). So what was lacking in numbers made up 
  in<BR>quality. There were a few Global Skimmers (Pantala flavescens) in 
  the<BR>general area.<BR><BR>The butterflies were not very varied, but there 
  were clouds of Zebra<BR>Blues (Leptotes) on the mud along the shore. Flying 
  with these were a<BR>few Blue or Eyed Pansy (Junonia orythia), such a stunning 
  butterfly,<BR>the image is below the Deceptive Widow. Keeping to the right on 
  the<BR>montage, just below the Pansy is another species of blue that 
  was<BR>associating with the Zebra Blues. I took a photo believing at the 
  time<BR>that it was the only species of Pied Pierrot found in the 
  Nairobi<BR>region (sorry no common name for this one) Tuxentius calice, when 
  I<BR>downloaded the images it just did not look right and so I 
  consulted<BR>three different publications and all three confirmed that this 
  was the<BR>Black Pied Pierrot (Tuxentius melaena). However it is more 
  exciting<BR>than that. Larsen states the butterfly is coastal, extending 
  inland to<BR>Yatta Plateau and Taita Hills! This would appear to be a first in 
  this<BR>whole region, but Larsen was produced in 1991 and reprinted in 
  2000.<BR>Nothing has been published on the regional butterflies since then, 
  but<BR>maybe it has since been found in this area.<BR><BR>If you look on the 
  montage, second row far left is a frog. This is<BR>another story. Ten years 
  ago I found an identical frog to this one in<BR>IUCN near a flooded rock pool 
  but low in some vegetation. It is a<BR>Leptopelis Tree-Frog, readily 
  identified by the vertical pupil. I sent<BR>the image around to the experts, 
  and they could not identify it. The<BR>closest they could get was Leptopelis 
  bocagei, which is a dull brown<BR>frog, and suggested this was a green form. 
  Nothing happened until<BR>about four years ago when Fleur with her Wednesday 
  Bird Walk found one<BR>at Uhuru Gardens, and although images were sent off to 
  the right<BR>people, it came to the same result. Now this at Endashant is 
  the<BR>third. You would imagine that if this is a species that is 
  usually<BR>brown, why have we never seen brown individuals, just these 
  bright<BR>green animals. It does suggest that this is still an 
  undescribed<BR>species. An interesting thing about bocagei, which could 
  equally apply<BR>to this beast is that it cocoons itself underground and 
  aestivates for<BR>long periods of drought.<BR><BR>The last image bottom left 
  is the view from the proposed campsite, and<BR>it is truly quite stunning. 
  Whilst we were on the lakeshore, a Maasai<BR>gentleman greeted us and was a 
  pleasure to meet. We talked much about<BR>the region, and he obviously enjoyed 
  nature (even carried a pair of<BR>binoculars). We could see that this man was 
  a great contact for anyone<BR>wanting to visit the area. On the walk back he 
  showed us the site he<BR>proposed for camping, and had us tasting some fruit, 
  which were very<BR>tart. We did not know what the bush was.<BR>Stephen was his 
  name and he was the regional Pastor, and owned a<BR>sizeable portion of land. 
  We arranged that we would advise just how<BR>interesting his area was, and as 
  you can see it really is, for all<BR>branches of wildlife, and that we would 
  publicize his details as a<BR>contact.<BR>So anyone wishing to visit 
  Endashant, and not having hassles should advise<BR><BR>Stephen Parmuat Ole 
  Mparingoi<BR>&lt;stempar@yahoo.com&gt;<BR>Phone 0722-397351 or 
  0732-018919<BR><BR>&#8230;..of their intended visit.<BR><BR>Fleur researched the 
  fruit we ate, and advised it was Zizyphus, this<BR>is the only known 
  food-plant of Dark Pied Pierrot butterflies!<BR><BR>Best to 
  all<BR>Brian<BR></P></DIV><!-- end group email -->
