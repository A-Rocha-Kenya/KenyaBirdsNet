  <pre>Dear Birders

I&#39;m hoping someone can assist me in getting back in touch with Chege wa 
Kariuki, and at least confirm for me that something bad has not befallen 
Chege. I was in regular contact with him last year and up to February 
this year, but since then his email correspondence has gone dead and his 
phone has been off on the numerous occasions I&#39;ve tried to call him. Is 
Chege still operating his business? Is he okay?

Many thanks
Michael Mills
