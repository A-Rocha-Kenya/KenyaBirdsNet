The appeal below is about whales and people, not birds, but I thought it is a worthy cause.<BR>

Wishing you good birding, Fleur<BR>

&nbsp;<BR>
Can you help us make a dream come true for two young Kenyan researchers. <BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Since 2011 Watamu Marine Association has been studying endangered humpback whales which make an impressive annual migration of around 4,000km from the Southern Ocean in Antarctica to the East African coast. Our two young researchers &nbsp;Mike Mwang&#8217;ombe and Kahindi Charo who are both members of our Watamu Community Groups have been tracking their movements and recording their numbers to provide the first ever data on humpback whales from the north Kenyan coast. We now know that this breeding population of whales number up to 500 individual animals. This data is important for developing regional and international conservation strategies.<BR>
In recognition of this valuable conservation work, Mike and Kahindi have been invited to present their data at the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0F8DC8"><FONT FACE="Arial">Humpback Whale World Congress - Madagascar</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT COLOR="#666666"> &lt;<a href="https://hwwc2015.org/index.php">https://hwwc2015.org/index.php</a>&gt; <BR>
</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">This will be the first time</FONT></SPAN><FONT FACE="Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><SPAN STYLE='font-size:11pt'> that Kenya has been represented at this global conference. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE='font-size:12pt'> <BR>
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE='font-size:11pt'>To get them there next Saturday 27th June &nbsp;we need to raise GBP600 / KSh87,000 for flights and accommodation <BR>
&nbsp;Both Mike and Kahindi are extraordinary as they only have a secondary school education and are self taught in using GIS mapping, photographic ID techniques and data analysis.<BR>
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE='font-size:12pt'>For them to attend the Congress would be a huge personal achievement and a national accolade. It would also encourage other young Kenyan scientists to excel in conservation.<BR>
