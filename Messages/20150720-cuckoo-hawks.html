  <pre>Greetings birders

Grey skies and drizzle greeted birders on Nature Kenya&#39;s Sunday Birdwatch on
19th July. However, the huge fig tree at Rura in Karen was full of
Hartlaub&#39;s Turacos and Green Pigeons to cheer us up.

When the skies lightened a little at midday, a bird of prey flew directly
towards us and landed on a nearby tree. An African Cuckoo Hawk! Soon another
arrived, an immature this time, and then a third one. They spent half an
hour or so catching prey among the branches.

It was also in mid-July that we saw an African Cuckoo Hawk at the same place
in 2013.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
