  <pre>Dear All,
A closer look at the flying image reveals a White-eyed Slaty! It was
very close to the Semi-collared,

Best for now

&gt; Dear All,
&gt; Although I had a clear view of the flycatcher this morning, it was for
&gt; about two seconds in morning gloom, and it flew off. I spent an hour
&gt; looking for it, but to no avail. At 11.30am it got brighter and I went
&gt; out for another 45 minutes, but the only passerine migrant I saw was a
&gt; few Barn Swallows.
&gt; At 3.00pm I tried again, and there it was in the Grevillea robustas
&gt; hawking from the highest branches. I phoned Nigel Hunter and he came
&gt; around and had a successful twitch as it was a lifer for him.
&gt; Attached are two images, one perched and a really strange one in flight.
&gt; Best to all
&gt; Brian
