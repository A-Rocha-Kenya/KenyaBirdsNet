  <pre>Greetings Birders


It was quality rather than quantity on Nature Kenya&#39;s Wednesday Morning
Birdwalk to the Nairobi Arboretum on August 5:


We had good views of two Turaco species: the resident Hartlaub&#39;s Turaco (at
least two, perhaps four individuals) and the unusual Purple-crested Turaco,
who has been resident in the Arboretum for the past three years.


Also good views of Silvery-cheeked Hornbill, Black Cuckooshrike and several
brilliant male African Paradise Flycatchers.


The Arboretum itself had been battered and littered by last weekend&#39;s freak
hailstorm. There were fallen trees, broken branches, shredded leaves, and
the riverbanks were wall-to-wall plastic bags, all from the recent storms.
We met the Forester, who was busy trying to organize repairs to the damage.


Wishing you good birding, Fleur
