      <p>NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK  11th July 2015<br>
<br>...<br>
<br>...   Also here was a strange raptor<br>
which defied identification and its images are attached. It was shaped<br>
like a Black Kite, and twisted its tail whilst flying. It was also of<br>
similar size, however it had a rounded, almost wedge-shaped tail. The<br>
bill was grey with a black tip. The upperwing had a curios white mark<br>
present on both wings, this was located across the wing-coverts rather<br>
than the margin, and the inner edge of the wing-coverts was paler than<br>
the leading edge. The tail like the back and wing-coverts were<br>
considerably paler than all of the dark flight-feathers. The<br>
underwings were as dark as the upper side of the flight-feathers, but<br>
the head appeared paler than the breast and the rest of the<br>
upperparts. It is a mystery any suggestions as to what it was most<br>
appreciated, but also the reasons why you think it is what you<br>
suggest.<br></p></div></div></div></div></blockquote><div><br></div><div>Brian and all,</div><div><br></div><div>Dark morph Booted Eagle is a potential candidate that leapt to mind when I read Brian&#39;s description and saw his photos.  Perhaps a partially melanistic immature individual?   But I am not sure how far-fetched the presence of an immature (non-breeding) Booted Eagle would be in Kenya this time of year.  Do immatures regularly stay on the wintering grounds and skip the return to northerly breeding areas during their second year?</div><div><br></div><div>Features generally consistent with dark morph Booted Eagle in Brian&#39;s photos are the fairly long + wedge-shaped tail, dark coloration above and below, pale marks near the leading edge of the upper wing, size and appearance roughly similar to Black Kite.</div><div><br></div><div>But some features of dark morph Booted Eagle do not match Brian&#39;s bird.  It lacks a pale rump patch, lacks the significant buffy band across the wing coverts, lacks buffy scapular patches, plus a few other issues.  But partial melanism might explain darker-than-normal coloration and missing or smaller-than-normal pale plumage areas.   And buffy plumage patches often fade to whitish when certain bird species are in heavily worn plumage.  And worn / missing feathers can <span></span>give the appearance of whitish plumage patches.  Maybe extensive feather wear explains the small whitish upper wing patches.</div><div><br></div><div>So perhaps Brian&#39;s bird is a melanistic immature Booted Eagle spending the season in Kenya?</div><div><br></div><div>I am by no means confident of this ID possibility, but it was the only thing that seemed remotely feasible to me...</div><div><br></div><div>Nathan Dias - Charleston, South Carolina, USA</div><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex"><div style="background-color:#fff">
