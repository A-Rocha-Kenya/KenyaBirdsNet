  <pre>Dear All,
There are interesting observations in NNP from FONNAP, getting posted
to their Facebook page. On 12th there was a Cheetah at 27, which is
fantastic news, and on the 5th August a superb adult Palm-nut Vulture
was photographed at Hippo Pools.
On the home front I have not seen the Bat Hawks since Sunday morning,
so hopefully they are tied up with domestic duties in IUCN,

Best for now
Brian
