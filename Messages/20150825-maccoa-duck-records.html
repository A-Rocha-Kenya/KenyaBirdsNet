  <div dir="ltr">Dear all,<div><br></div><div>For the past six months or so, I have been trying to gather information on where  Maccoa Duck currently roost (current distribution) and possibly their approximate population in the country (particularly the Rift valley and Central Highlands). I visited  small wetlands within Molo and Kinangop grasslands where the species has been recorded in the past, but saw none.Instead, of the 45 dam I visited in Molo, 95% had little or no water in them in June- maybe this has change by now because of the recent rains. Actually most of the dams were being rehabilitated by the County government at the time; well, Maccoa Duck does not like disturbed wetlands at all.</div><div><br></div><div>The only records I know of this year are those observed during the waterfowl Counts in February at Lake Sonachi (5 individuals) and Lake Ol Bolossat (4 individuals). The Maccoa Ducks have also recently returned in Manguo Swamp- 5 individuals were counted during the Sunday Potluck (15th August, 215) led by Fleur. I also observed a male at the same swamp during a random visit on 4th July.</div><div><br></div><div>All in all the Maccoa Duck population seems to be decreasing drastically in the Country. If you have seen the species recently (between January and now), kindly share the information with me through &lt;<a href="mailto:gkungu5@gmail.com">gkungu5@gmail.com</a>&gt;. I shall highly appreciate.</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you,</div><div>Gladys Kung&#39;u. </div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>
