  <pre>Dear Jonathan,
Madagascar Plover is not likely to make Kenya, I think you probably
mean Pratincole?
Best wishes

&gt; Hi birders i am back to Tana and hope to give out my sightings time to
&gt; time.
&gt; i and my two friends have been to the delta by boat from northern side of
&gt; the rive, Onkolde harbor,
&gt; The birds population has real reduce as the land has been so dry from over
&gt; grazing and water level has real reduced.
&gt; list of few
&gt; Goliath heron, African spoonbill ,spur-winged plover, wool necked stork,
&gt; yellow bill stork,fish eagle,and Madagascar plover were arround with few
&gt; Northen carmine bee eaters.
&gt; the list has common birds and time we visited was brief and hot.
&gt; Thank you
