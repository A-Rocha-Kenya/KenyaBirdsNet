  <hr/>
  <div dir="ltr">Greetings all,<div><br></div><div>On Tuesday 22nd September, I was at the Nairobi National Museum and decided to check on the Great Sparrowhawk nest. Here I was fortunate enough to observe not just both adults but also a rufous-breasted juvenile on the nest. One of the adults flew off and returned about 10 mins later with what looked like a Red-eyed or Dusky Turtle Dove. It then dropped the kill at the nest and flew off to a nearby branch allowing the young one to enjoy the meal alone. Meanwhile the second adult had flown off by this time and I didn&#39;t see it again for the 30 minutes or so that I spent at the nest. I told the Nature Kenya and Kenya Bird Map offices about it and both were unaware that the juvenile is there. It seems to be very young and has not been at the nest for long.</div><div>I&#39;ve attached some photos of the juvenile and one of an adult. They are not so clear as the birds were very high up a large Eucalyptus tree and my camera&#39;s zoom is quite weak.<br><br></div><div>Regards,</div><div>Sidney Shema<img src="cid:ii_15000d4701e2cf3d" alt="Inline image 2" width="544" height="378"><img src="cid:ii_15000d45b06b6916" alt="Inline image 1" width="544" height="489"><img src="cid:ii_15000d4c096070aa" alt="Inline image 4" width="544" height="306"><img src="cid:ii_15000d4a5cc836ef" alt="Inline image 3" width="544" height="456"></div></div>
