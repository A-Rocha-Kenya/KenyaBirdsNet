  <pre>Dear All,
Early this morning (7th) there were five Eurasian Golden Orioles in
the paddock, one male was singing which I have never heard here
before, also at least five Willow Warblers, Eurasian Bee-eaters in 4,2
and 3 but as they were not particularly going anywhere could all
relate to the same four. Largest flock this week so far is of 18. Also
a pair of lone Violet-backed Starlings, their presence is very
confusing, because there are no morning or evening flocks at present,
Best to all
Brian
