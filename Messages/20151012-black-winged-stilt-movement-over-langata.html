  <pre>Dear All,
This evening proved a very special day for Stilt observation. We had
our first short shower of the season, and just before 6.00pm in broad
daylight I could hear Black-winged Stilts somewhere close. I looked
out of my bedroom window, and to my utter satisfaction there was a
compact flock of 25 Stilts calling well. I watched them through
binoculars and having crossed the garden they continued NW, as I have
always thought they did. In three years of a century of records for
the species here, this is only the second time I have seen them! The
other was in the light of a full moon. Twenty-five is a larger number
than I had considered. Of course whilst it was a lovely sighting it
doesn’t add any information as to why they make this regular two-way
trip over the house every palearctic period Oct-April! The mystery
still continues…..
Best to all
Brian
