    The autumn migration 2015    of Lesser Spotted Eagles has started in September



SATELLITE TELEMETRY 


    The movements of birds have been investigated for the past 100 years mainly by ringing. In recent times    satellite telemetry has provided us with a new device which makes possible the permanent and worldwide automatic location of birds over an extended period of time.
    
    In view of the rapid development of this technique, a Yahoo Group for ‘Satellite Telemetry in Ornithology’ has been created for discussion and to help disseminate information on this technique    and its results among researchers and other interested individuals to overcome the problem of the long time-lapse involved in the publication of articles in scientific journals.

    This group had 518 members as of 20 September 2015.

    For a    breakdown of the Lesser Spotted Eagles  tracked now see the text below. This will be more and more    updated (breeding success etc., see the German version which is already more up to date). The archive shows earlier migrations.


    Arrival in spring 2015 has been very late this year. As expected at least in some areas the breeding success has been low or even very low, e.g. only 5 out of 32    pairs present in northwestern Pomerania (former district of Rostock) in Germany this year reared a young eagle. We shall try to get more data from other areas and countries. Any informtion would    be more than welcome.

     

    We shall compare the migration, spring arrivial with the breeding success of satellite-tracked eagles and will try to correlate the data with the ecological    conditions in the wintering areas of the birds concerned.
     

    Collaboration with other LSE trackers abroad would be very interesting and might lead to a joint publication.
     

    www.Satellite-Telemetry.de is the website of the World Working Group on    Birds of Prey (WWGBP) where some of the results of satellite telemetry studies are presented. Using this technique, studies of 15 different bird of prey species have been conducted since 1992, in    Germany and abroad.

    The    birds are individually designated by their transmitter number and in most cases they have also been given a name, some of them by the eyrie monitor. All birds are marked with GPS transmitters,    the last ones (Ulf, Marta and Jan) with GSM tags supplying often several hundred GPS fixes (plus altitude, speed and direction) per day.

     

    For reasons of time, only the course of migration of the Lesser Spotted    Eagle (Aquila pomarina), in cooperation with the BirdLife Germany federal office, is dealt with here,    with a very rough presentation of the course of migration. In order to show this online in as near as possible to real time, only one fix per day will bee used, although many more than 100 fixes    are received daily from some birds. Migration within Germany is not shown, in order to guarantee the anonymity of the eyrie sites of this extremely rare species.
