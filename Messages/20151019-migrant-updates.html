  <pre>Greetings birds

A Common (Steppe) Buzzard at Ngong Road Forest (Lenana section) on 17
October, and a Spotted Flycatcher near Yatch Club Island on Lake Naivasha on
18 October.

Otherwise, I fully agree with Brian that migrants seem to be late in
arriving this year. Lesser Striped Swallows, however, were sighted on a
couple of birdwalks since late September.

Good birding to all, Fleur
