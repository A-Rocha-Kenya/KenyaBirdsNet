  Hi birders the phenomena has happen today 25th October 2015. it is always been a story to tell others on what you see. To day at the back yard of the Ticket office Gede Forest station at 14hrs me and my fellow two Guides Alex Mwalimu and Johnson Kafulo watching for the Spotted ground thrush.<br>What has been amazing is that the bird is too shy and it has been feeding following the Golden rump Elephant shrew and the red capped robin chat. this is a good siting for the bird without straggling to go for a drive or start at dawn. the bird has been pausing for us at a time and then fly when it realize something is happen the binos set to its body with a whispering sound we have been making to show the direction it is feeding or it has patched on.<br>Great for Kafulo who has been reporting to us that he has seen it since September but each time we go for a search we did not succeed to support him, today we have confirm it is here and we encourage people to come and see it<br>Good birding<br>Regards<br>Jonathan Mwachongo &nbsp; <br><p><span><br class="yui-cursor"></span></p>
