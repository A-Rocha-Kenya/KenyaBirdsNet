  <pre>Hi Darcy,
The yellow eye, dark underparts with neat whitish rounded tips suggest
these are Brown Babblers which are the babbler you would expect at
Kitale. It&#39;s north of the equator all across to the highland parts of
the Ewaso Nyiro above Isiolo.
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; For years I&#39;ve been seeing babblers at our farm near Kitale.  I&#39;ve waivered
&gt; on their ID.  The attached photos suggest they are Arrow-marked, which
&gt; would be significantly out of the range for this species as indicated in
&gt; Zimmerman et al.
&gt;
&gt; The location of our farm is

&gt;
&gt; I&#39;d be grateful if someone could confirm this.  Assuming these are
&gt; Arrow-marked, is this population well known?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks, Darcy
