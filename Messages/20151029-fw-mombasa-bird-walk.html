<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Dear Birders</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>We decided to find out how many migrant waders had 
arrived.&nbsp; We went to Jumba La Mtwana Beach and although the tide was not at 
the best for looking at waders we were able to position ourselves top of the 
beach and wait for the birds to fly up to the still uncovered sand.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>The largest number were Grey Plovers, those landing 
and other large groups flying on past must have been about several 
hundred.&nbsp; One still had quite a lot of&nbsp;its summer plumage. Groups of 
mixed smaller waders also went zipping by but too far out for id.&nbsp; The ones 
landing near us were mostly Grey Plovers, with a couple of Whimbrels, two 
Sanderlings, Lesser and Greater Sand plovers, mostly lesser, one Little Stint, 
about 6 Ringed Plovers, 2 Common Sandpipers and a single Curlew Sandpiper.&nbsp; 
This beach used to be the&nbsp;best place to see Curlew Sandpipers there were 
always so many&nbsp;but &nbsp;now there are so few.&nbsp; I had hoped we would 
see a Terek Sandpiper but no luck maybe it was&nbsp;with the passing 
birds.&nbsp; No other Eurasian migrants,not even a Barn Swallow!</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Jumba Forest very quiet.&nbsp; Silvery-cheeked 
Hornbills were absent and all the other birds on our list were 'heard' 
only.&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>A special treat was the several turtles we saw 
popping up their heads in the sea.&nbsp; Jumba is one of their breeding sites so 
no doubt they would be waiting for the darkness to fall before coming out of the 
sea.&nbsp; There is a community turtle watch scheme here to make sure eggs are 
not predated or flooded.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Wishing you all happy birding!</FONT></DIV>
