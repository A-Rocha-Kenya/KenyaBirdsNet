  <hr/>
  <pre>  hallo everyone.while going through my work my supervisors requested me to check for this information.this is in relation to climate changes and effects to abiotic and biotic factors

1.does anyone knows of any data collected in regards to the status eg in size,levels  etc  of the following mt kenya lakes(terns)in the past 15years in relation to higher temparatures and climate changes that effects the glacier in mt kenya.?has the levels changed with time,remained the same over the same period?.some of these lakes are as of formation from glacier too.
            Lake holtan
            Lake honel
            Lake Airis
            Lake microsones.etc
2.Temparatures rise sometimes can result to some animals species hybanating to cooler areas etc or cause estivation.in mt kenya highest peak mackinders eagle owl (Bubo capensis mackinderi)still breed and roost in the same higher elevations and the population remains an affected.in relation to breeding can change of temparatures affect this species behaviors?or any other bird in this elevation.?.mackinders can roost on the grounds,on trees but when it comes to breeding they are selective due to some factors like security,prey prefences etc.
