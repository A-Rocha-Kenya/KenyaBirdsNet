Hi,
 
This is good...and  interesting!
 
BTW, Nigel Hunter, Brian Finch, and  I observed a landed flock of ca. 50 
Steppe Eagles on Lolldaiga Hills  Ranch, central Kenya, yesterday morning...in 
passage with at least two Lesser  Spotted Eagles. Good numbers of Steppes 
and Lesser Spotteds observed elsewhere  on the Laikipia high ground over the 
past  week. 
 
Best  regards,
 
Tom

Dear all,  
 
 

Congratulations and thanks to  Igor, Elvira and all friends and colleagues 
in Russia and elsewhere who have  worked so hard to provide the information 
that has led to this  decision.  

 
 
 
 
Hopefully this new  categorisation will increase the likely success of 
research funding  applications for researchers who are working to better 
understand the  vulnerabilities of Steppe Eagle populations in breeding and 
wintering areas,  and along migration routes.



Very best wishes 

Bernd Meyburg
