  <pre>Dear All,
Recently Nigel Hunter and myself went to stay with Tom Butynski on
Lolldaiga Hills Ranch. Whilst there we were joined by Paul and Eleanor
Benson for the 31st Oct, Chris Thouless joined us on 1st Nov in
Mukogodo, and he and Caroline kindly put the three of us up at their
house for the nights of 31st Oct and 1st Nov., and for both these
dates we enjoyed the company of Lawrence, the bird-guide at Borana
Lodge. For our full day on Lolldaiga on 2nd Nov., Paul spent the
entire day with us.
The more interesting observations follow, but this is far from the
full list which exceeded 200 on Lolldaiga alone in spite of the
relatively short time we were there,
Best for now
Brian

There is a full size montage which is large and the choice of one at
50% for those who are frightened by the size of the first one!

BIRD SURVEY OF LAIKIPIA… LOLLDAIGA, OLE NAISHU, BORANA, MUKOGODO FOREST.

ITINERARY
30th Oct 2015 Drove Nairobi to Lolldaiga, birded as far as old Maize
Paddock in late afternoon
31st Oct Drove from TB house out through Ole Naishu ranch and across
Borana arriving at Mukogodo Forest in early afternoon.
1st Nov All day in Mukogodo Forest, and just four kilometres down the
main descent road in afternoon.
2nd Nov All day on Borana, back across Ole Naishu to Lolldaiga.
3rd Nov All day outing on Lolldaiga to Black Rock, Ngainitu Kopje
(North Gate), Sinyai Lugga and evening near the Monument.
4th Nov Morning on descent road to Main Gate, Lolldaiga and forest
along Timau River, leaving 11.15am for Nairobi.

On 30th October 2015, Nigel Hunter and myself visited Lolldaiga to
stay with Tom Butynski for a few days, with a visit to Mukogodo Forest
for two of those days. We returned to Nairobi on late morning on 4th
November.

During the six days we recorded the birds on Lolldaiga, Ole Naishu,
Borana and the forest of Mukodogo. A number of new species were found
for the area, and equally importantly some records given in the past
for the Forest were found to be erroneous and require correction,
before they sneak into historical repetition.

Migrants were poor, apart from Wheatears but there were some
interesting species. A summary of the more interesting observations
are as follows:


STONE PARTRIDGE
One party called late afternoon from scree slopes on the descent road
through Mukogodo Forest, but recorded by multiple observers there in
the past. A party calling mid-morning at Black Rock on Lolldaiga was
the first confirmed record of the species on that ranch, although TB
thought he had heard them there before, which is why we were visiting
that site.

LESSER KESTREL
As we left Borana there were just three birds feeding over the grassland.

EURASIAN HOBBY
In five days, only four birds were recorded in the area.

TAITA FALCON
A major surprise whilst we were waiting for Stone Partridge to call at
Black Rock on Lolldaiga. There was a small falcon perched on an
overhanging bush at quite a distance and attempts were made to get
some images (attached). This bird flew off and was replaced by another
bird that was entirely white below. Immature Taita Falcons can be
white below, but lightly streaked, however this bird was plain white
with no markings. The first bird was also pale, but the trousers and
belly were cinnamon washed, and this too was otherwise unmarked below.
Both the views were distant, and the images not clear, but the
features include very short tail, with tail and wings the same length,
the tail slightly shorter in length than the width of the wing at the
base, and taking the distance between the start of the
undertail-coverts at the middle of the tail, and the tip of the centre
of the tail, the undertail-coverts account for between 60-65% of that
length.

All of the regional guides only depict Taita Falcons with deep rufous
underparts, but a check on the internet shows images that are almost
whitish below, and the underpart colouring is far more variable than
the literature would have us believe.

The images in the top left area show the small male bird on top of the
bush, and the larger and whiter female, under the bush (upper
left-most two). The flying bird has just taken off and is flying
through the branches, which is why it appears broad-winged at this
time. This image is a blow up of the bird flying through the bush,
bottom middle of the falcon section, which gives an idea of the
distance from us.
The three insets of good images are there for comparison.

The identification of very pale and a white breasted Taita Falcon has
come about by a process of elimination for all other falcon species,
accipiters and other small birds of prey. Firstly other falcons with
yellow legs, all have tails longer than wing projection with the
exceptions of the much larger Sooty and Eleonora’s Falcons, which
extend beyond the tail in the first, and are equal length in the
latter. Most falcons have prominent dark markings on the underparts.
Every Accipiter has the tail projecting well beyond the wing tips.

BROWN SNAKE-EAGLE
Only a recent addition to the Lolldaiga list, one was perched in the north-east.

EURASIAN SPARROWHAWK
This very nice individual was soaring over the Monument on Lolldaiga.
In the morning one was seen from Tom’s lawn flying south following the
valley but very high.
So few East African records, only recorded with anything like
regularity at Ngulia.

LESSER SPOTTED EAGLE
Small numbers were mixed with Steppe Eagles flying over Lolldaiga and
Mukodogo Forest. A new species for Lolldaiga.

STEPPE EAGLE
Commonly seen, but fifty sitting together in the early morning near
the farm on Lolldaiga.

WAHLBERG’S EAGLE
One pale-ish bird on the edge of Mukogodo Forest was a bit unexpected there.

HARTLAUB’S BUSTARD
One seen in the evening, and on the second morning, a bird some
kilometres away on Borana not far from the large dam. It’s really
beginning to look like Hartlaub’s is the commoner of the two
black-bellied type Bustards on Laikipia in spite of past observations.

COMMON RINGED PLOVER
Three were on the large dam on Borana.

COMMON SNIPE
Four were on the large dam on Borana.

COMMON GREENSHANK
One was on the large dam on Borana.

GREEN SANDPIPER
Scattered in small numbers on various water bodies.

WOOD SANDPIPER
Five were on the large dam on Borana, and singles elsewhere.

COMMON SANDPIPER
One was on Lolldaiga, and two were on the large dam on Borana.

LITTLE STINT
Four were on the large dam on Borana.

RUFF
One was on the large dam on Borana.

COMMON SWIFT
Small numbers over Lolldaiga, Borana and Mukogodo Forest.

NYANZA SWIFT
Flying around the sheer wall at Black Rock on Lolldaiga, in aerial
chases with the more numerous African Black Swift, returning again and
again. This was a new record for Lolldaiga.

AFRICAN BLACK SWIFT
Noisy parties at Black Rock on Lolldaiga flying around the cliff.

EURASIAN ROLLER
One bird in northern Lolldaiga was the only individual.

EURASIAN BEE-EATER
A party of thirty near the north gate on Lolldaiga were the only birds
recorded there, also heard on Borana.

VIOLET WOOD-HOOPOE
Whilst this is resident along the lower Ewaso Nyiro in Samburu region,
all records on Laikipia appear to list Green Wood-Hoopoe. Personally I
have never seen Green on Lolldaiga only Violet, and attached are
images to support this, showing that this is not the northern race
marwitzi of Green. It would be interesting to see other images of
either species for Laikipia, because the Green must be close by. It
appears that in the absence of Green, the Violet have not restricted
themselves to riverine and are wide ranging right up to the tall Cedar
woodland.

SPOT-FLANKED BARBET
We saw several on the descending road through Mukogodo Forest.
Interestingly O’Brien in his study of the area in 2011 failed to
record it in twelve days of bird survey in the area, however Coverdale
et al 2009 did also record it.

RED-THROATED WRYNECK
It’s abundance on Lolldaiga after the rain when it becomes very vocal,
is impressive.

THREE-STREAKED TCHAGRA
North Gate on Lolldaiga, is the lowest elevation on the ranch at 1700m
(5,577 feet) which is still quite high for many species. Here in a
short space of time we had five species not recorded on Lolldaiga
before. There is a large granite and lava kopje there called Ngainitu
where Acacia mellifera and Commiphora species are the dominant cover.
On this hill were a pair of Three-streaked Tchagras, the habitat
looked suitable in spite of the altitude. The usual ceiling given for
the species is 1,100m, but on NW Laikipia at Sosian they extend much
higher than this. This was a new species for Lolldaiga.

NORTHERN PUFFBACK
A common species from most of Lolldaiga including the Timau River
woodland. Numerous in Mukodogo Forest, where mis-identified as
Black-backed Puffback in O’Brien et al 2011 (Northern not recorded),
but identified correctly as Northern by Turner 1983 &amp; Coverdale et al
2009. Black-backed should not be anywhere near the forest, although
with Northern on the Timau River and on Lelwel, and only Black-backed
in Mt Kenya forests, this suggests that the two species might indeed
meet.

BLACK CUCKOO-SHRIKE
Widespread but several in Mukodogo Forest where Coverdale 2009 and
O’Brien 2011 failed to record it, but both did see Grey Cuckoo-shrike,
which we also recorded. This suggests that it might be a seasonal
thing, but one of our males was territorial.

RED-BACKED SHRIKE
One female in the large inhabited clearing in Mukodogo Forest was the
only individual seen.

ISABELLINE SHRIKE
One near Main Gate on Lolldaiga was the only individual seen.

TAITA FISCAL
At least three birds were on the plains past the big dam on Lolldaiga.
Apparently they have only recently arrived here. They are more
numerous in the northern parts of Lolldaiga, both places exceeding the
ceiling of 1500m.

EURASIAN GOLDEN ORIOLE
Only two birds seen, one around the house on Lolldaiga, and one in
Mukodogo Forest.

BLACK-HEADED ORIOLE
Very common in Mukodogo Forest, and although in habitat that might
appear suitable for Montane Oriole, this species was entirely absent.

FAN-TAILED RAVEN
Frequent over the area, especially near cliffs, but twenty in the air
together at Black Rock on Lolldaiga.

GREY-RUMPED SWALLOW
Three birds were on the large dam at Borana.

BARN SWALLOW
Seen throughout, but more of a trickle migration and no concentrations.

ANGOLA SWALLOW
Several on the Timau River on the Lolldaiga Main Gate, may have
recently arrived for breeding.

ETHIOPIAN SWALLOW
One at the farm, and one on a small dam on Lolldaiga, and several
around the farm on Borana. Possibly newly arrived for the breeding
season.

COMMON HOUSE MARTIN
Small parties frequent in Lolldaiga and Mukodogo Forest.

LESSER STRIPED SWALLOW
Not recorded, which follows the current pattern in Nairobi.

BORAN CISTICOLA
Potentially this has to be one of the most abundant birds on Lolldaiga.

GREY APALIS
Common in the Mukogodo Forest.

GREY WREN WARBLER
Only seen on Lolldaiga where confined to the scrub on Ngainitu kopje.
CABANIS’S GREENBUL
This was the only Greenbul species recorded in Mukodogo Forest. We did
not encounter either the Zanzibar Sombre reported by Coverdale et al
2009, nor the Montane reported by Turner 1983. O’Brien 2011 also only
found Cabanis’s in the high forest.

EASTERN NICATOR
Encountered several times in Mukogodo Forest, and its presence is very
surprising. Odd birds sang and called from the vicinity of dry luggas
in the forest and along the descent road. O’Brien 2011 research did
not detect it, but in Coverdale 2009, independently he and Patrick
Plumb saw one briefly but it was chosen to keep the unusual record
notated as follows…. “This bird was seen very briefly by Patrick Plumb
and myself separately. It appeared grey above with pale whitish
panels. This needs confirmation.”
We can confirm that Eastern Nicator as unlikely as it may seem is
present in small numbers in Mukogodo Forest.

EASTERN OLIVACEOUS WARBLER
Although usually a common migrant and winter visitor, one along the
Sinyai Lugga near North Gate on Lolldaiga was the only bird
encountered and new for Lolldaiga.

WILLOW WARBLER
Ridiculously only three birds encountered in the six days.

BROWN PARISOMA
Common in Cedar on Lolldaiga where not seen in Acacia, on Borana in
Acacia near the Mukogodo exit gate, but in Cedar in the forest.

BROWN BABBLER
Rather in parallel with African Thrush, this is a western species that
has a tongue of distribution across southern Laikipia. On Lolldaiga it
is numerous, and on Borana it fed on the Thouless’s bird table on the
western side of the ranch.

BLACK-LORED BABBLER
Only the form vepres is in the region, where it is quite common. Birds
near the Main Gate were calling, and I thought that they sounded
extremely like Northern Pied Babbler rather than Black-lored, and so
we played recordings of Northern Pied to them and they reacted
immediately and with the Northern Pied and the vepres calling at the
same time it was not possible to see the difference. So as to what
these birds really are, is still unresolved. However O’Brien 2011
included Northern Pied in his Mukogodo Forest survey, and these were
undoubtedly vepres.

YELLOW WHITE-EYE
Examination of birds on Lolldaiga, Borana and Mukodogo Forest shows
only Yellow White-eye present and not Montane or Abyssinian as claimed
in the past. O’Brien 2011 recorded only Montane White-eye in Mukodogo
Forest. We closely examined and photographed white-eyes in the forest
and only found Yellow. By contrast Coverdale et al 2009, realised that
the birds of Mukodogo were not Montane, and put them to Abyssinian. It
is important to remember that Yellow was not suspected as occurring in
this area in those days, and I have photographed Yellow on Lelwel near
Timau. Now it would be interesting to identify the birds in Imenti
Forest, which I suspect might turn out to be Yellow.

AFRICAN THRUSH
Resident around the farm and gardens on Lolldaiga, side by side with
Olive Thrush. Maybe the species, with southern Laikipia as its only
known distribution east of the Rift, is still spreading eastwards.

WHITE-BROWED ROBIN-CHAT
A common species from most of Lolldaiga including the Timau River
woodland. Numerous in Mukodogo Forest, where mis-identified as
Ruppell’s Robin-Chat in O’Brien et al 2011 (though White-browed was
also recorded), but the only Robin-Chat mentioned in Coverdale et al
2009 is Red-capped and some were sight records. From our observations
where we only recorded White-browed, we would suggest that any
reference to Ruppell’s is an error, although we never had a sign of
Red-capped it must be noted that the piece of research was in June.

WHINCHAT
Just one bird in the old maize paddock on Lolldaiga.

ISABELLINE WHEATEAR
Probably very slightly more numerous than Northern, and widely
encountered in the open country.

NORTHERN WHEATEAR
Frequent and widespread.

PIED WHEATEAR
About eight birds encountered.

BROWN-TAILED ROCK CHAT
Perhaps the strangest range extension of all, and another treasure
from Ngainitu kopje near North Gate at 1700m. Walking along a dramatic
erosion gulley near the base of the hill, I could hear Brown-tailed
Rock-Chat singing. We located a pair of birds in the bottom of the
gulley singing from small rocks. The usual ceiling given for this
species is 1200m. They do occur on kopjes in Shaba Game Reserve, and
one place I know on a boulder ridge in Samburu. This is the first
record for Lolldaiga.

COMMON ROCK-THRUSH
There were two (male and female) close to North Gate on Lolldaiga.

PALE FLYCATCHER
There cannot be anywhere where Pale Flycatcher can be commoner, and on
Lolldaiga it is one of the most frequently encountered species. On Ole
Naishu and Borana it was frequent even in sparsely bushed country, in
Mukodogo Forest it was very common and was even photographed well out
in the grassy clearings feeding on the ground.
In O’Brien 2011, Pale Flycatcher was not recorded, but Grey Flycatcher
was, and this is an obvious mis-identification. We did encounter Grey
Flycatcher near the large dam on Borana and a few in the dry acacia
scrub in northern Lolldaiga. Coverdale et al 2009, only identified
Pale Flycatcher in Mukodogo Forest as would be expected.

SPOTTED FLYCATCHER
Together with Northern and Isabelline Wheatears this would be the most
numerous land migrants encountered, and was widespread.

SEMI-COLLARED FLYCATCHER
Five days prior to this I had had a Semi-collared Flycatcher in my
garden in Langata. Any record east of the Rift is noteworthy, but we
were stunned to see one in Acacia scrub near Ngainitu kopje. This was
a new bird for Lolldaiga.

HUNTER’S SUNBIRD
How to explain this one! On the edge of Mukogodo Forest, along a dry
lugga, were several flowering Erythrina abyssinica, and these were a
great magnet for sunbirds. Feeding here were the expected Amethyst,
Scarlet-chested, Northern Double-collared and Variable, but also a
young male Golden-winged Sunbird. Lower down on flowering Carissa was
another male sunbird with a scarlet chest, but it was showing very
conspicuous violet shoulder patches. It then proceeded to hover
revealing the entire iridescent violet rump. It remained in the area
all the time we were there and was present again the following day.
There was also a female present. It’s actually the first time in my
life I have seen Scarlet-chested and Hunter’s feeding together.
The location was over 1700m (5,577 feet) roughly the same elevation as
North Gate on Lolldaiga. The species is very common at the lowest
levels in Acacia/Commiphora scrub, especially the three Samburu
reserves, but also in riverine where Scarlet-chested do not occur. The
usual ceiling for this species is given as 1200m.

SHINING SUNBIRD
Whilst climbing Ngainitu at 1700m at the base, and looking for the
calling Three-streaked Tchagra, imitations of Pearl-spotted Owlet (not
recorded on Lolldaiga) brought in a stunning male Shining Sunbird. A
half-an-hour later a female appeared. This was a new species for
Lolldaiga. It is known from the Ewaso Nyiro in the three Samburu
reserves, and also occurs on the hills in N Samburu. The ceiling for
this species is given as 1000m, so again whilst very high for them,
the habitat looked ideal. It was a new species for Lolldaiga.

BLACK-NECKED WEAVER
Whilst birding the base of Ngainitu, we encountered a mixed feeding
party, which contained a pair of Black-necked Weavers. These were the
first ever recorded on Lolldaiga.

CHESTNUT WEAVER
In the scrub at the base of Ngainitu we encountered a small party of
Chestnut Weavers. Strangely this was the first record for Lolldaiga.

JACKSON’S WIDOWBIRD
In the old maize paddock on Lolldaiga, an unplumaged male was singing
from a shrub on the first and last dates, but no other birds were
seen.

AFRICAN QUAILFINCH
Stopping in long grass not far from Lolldaiga Main Gate we found
several of these birds, and it constituted a new species for
Lolldaiga.

VILLAGE INDIGOBIRD
In the same place as the Quailfinch, there was a male and four females
of this species, which surprisingly was a new species for Lolldaiga.

YELLOW WAGTAIL
Apart from three on grassland in Mukodogo Forest, one at the large dam
on Borana was the only other individual encountered.

TREE PIPIT
A few appeared both in Mukodogo Forest and Lolldaiga with the arrival
of the rain.

BUSH PIPIT
A secretive species, but Laikipia does seem to be a major part of the
Kenyan distribution. On Lolldaiga we chanced on three feeding around a
rain-puddle along the road to the north, and three in grass near the
Monument. We also had one on Ole Naishu. There are undoubtedly many
more in the bushland.

THICK-BILLED SEEDEATER
We had three birds feeding in low bushes in a clearing in Mukodogo
Forest. O’Brien 2011 did not record the species, neither was it seen
in Coverdale et al 2009.
