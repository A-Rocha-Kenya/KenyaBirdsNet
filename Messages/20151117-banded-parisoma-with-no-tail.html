  <hr/>
  <div dir="ltr">Dear all,<div><br></div><div>On a short bird mapping expedition last week at Ol Donyo Orok (Namanga Hill) for Kenya Bird Map, we came across a strange sight. A Banded Parisoma without a tail! At first we thought it was a crombec but on closer inspection we realized it was a parisoma. Does anyone have any similar previous experiences or know how it could have possibly lost its tail? A close shave with a predator maybe? A ringing session gone wrong??<br><br>See the pictures attached below.</div><div><br></div><div>Best,Â <br><br></div><div>Sidney Shema</div></div>
