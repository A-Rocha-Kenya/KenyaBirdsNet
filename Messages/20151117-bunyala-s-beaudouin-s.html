  <div dir="ltr">Dear everyone,<div><br></div><div><p class="MsoNormal">My first elaborate photograph of an adult Beaudouin’s Snake Eagle
at Bunyala (far western Kenya) was in October 2012. Since then different juveniles
of the species have turned up yearly or a little longer (2014, 2015) from which
I posit that there have been at least 2 successful breeding seasons, having
photographed the subsequent young birds. Other subjects captured in photographs
include a nicely barred possible female with a nearly complete dark hood to the
gular region during 2012. There was also a possible male during 2013 with an
incomplete hood ventrally, with paler gular region merging into the pale
breast/rest of underside.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal">Yesterday’s subject was a lucky shot that found me with my
pants down but I managed some nice shots anyway, I think. Bunyala is currently
all soggy and flooded. Any good birding (I mean on foot) means you must be
ready to endure the leeches’ bites and bear considerable degree of foot rot.
Yesterday morning’s survey with my scouting team against bird poisoning ended
at about 11am, compelled by a stormy downpour. An hour later I found myself
perched on higher ground that is an embankment that prevents irrigation/flood
water from flowing over into my camping grounds (but not the underground
seepage of course). Bored at staring into the scope in bad light, I walked back
a few metres into camp to examine our chicken pen that is also now on soggy
grounds. I was startled by a shadow that flew over my camouflaged ‘watch tower’
severally getting obscured by foliage; just turned out that he was a Juvenile
African Harrier Hawk. However, looking in the distance about half a kilometre away
I saw a Black-breasted raptor &amp; at first thought he must be a Black-chested
Snake Eagle &amp; I was going to key in the species into ARDB shortly. She
hovered &amp; I knew that was inconclusive behaviour. However, the ferocious ambushing
of the pigeons that ensued shortly after raised my concern having seen that of
the Beaudouin’s here in Bunyala. The Black-chested SEs that I have encountered
here have tended to be inclined to eating the numerous Nile monitor babies
&amp; snakes, hunting generally more gracefully compared to the rather nimble
tactic I see employed by the Beaudoin. Well the photos confirm that she was
Beaudouin’s even though again this was odd for me as I had presumed that many
of these raptors turn up when it is not as flooded as it is at the moment save
the African Fish Eagle. Ideally, hunting is easier for the other terrestrial raptors
in the absence of the water and even the doves/pigeons would keep off from the
flooded plantation. But again with quite a number of overgrown bushes, small
birds are still able to perch within the flooded fields so it makes perfect sense.
Other raptors included a resident Grey Kestrel, Gymnogene and Peregrine Falcon.
Two days ago we had a Red-necked Falcon and Booted Eagle.</p>
