I recently visited the woods adjacent to the Kitale Forest offices and unlike two years ago where indigenous trees covered considerable acreage, today a sizeable chunk has been encroached to pave way for farming. Naturally, while &nbsp;a few years ago it was common to see the Ross's Turaco, the black and white-casqued hornbill and some raptors this is not so today. I was only treated to flycatcthers, sunbirds, finches, white-eyes, weavers. Nonetheless, I was assured that reclamation efforts are under way through re-introduction of indigenous trees in encroached area.&nbsp;</div><div id="yiv1146596281yui_3_16_0_1_1449511830344_2679" dir="ltr"><br></div><div id="yiv1146596281yui_3_16_0_1_1449511830344_2679" dir="ltr">NB: I spotted the attached bird but could not quite place its ID. Figured it could be a juvenile fiscal or a shrike but which one?</div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
