  <p>What would be the really logical thing to do is to take the SGR through the illegal housing estates that have been built on the edge of the Park, just flatten them and use them for the raised bed, they have no legal existence so it is a win win.</p>

<div id="ygrp-text">
<p>&gt; NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 12th DECEMBER 2015<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Dear All,<br />&gt; This is Nairobi National Parks darkest hour. A couple of years ago<br />&gt; when President Kenyatta and the Chinese Premier hosted the ceremonial<br />&gt; burning of Elephant and Rhinoceros ivory at Ivory Burning Site, they<br />&gt; revealed a monument pledging joint efforts to protect the wildlife for<br />&gt; future generations. At this time it appears that they were also<br />&gt; negotiating a deal to construct a railway line right through the Park<br />&gt; causing major excision of a large part. It would seem duplicity on the<br />&gt; part of the Kenya Government to show to the world that it was serious<br />&gt; in protecting wildlife and the environment, whilst at the same time<br />&gt; planning the demise of one of the countries most important wildlife<br />&gt; centres. We can only hope that they see the error of this judgement,<br />&gt; and find the alternative wholly outside of NNP.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; The projected intrusion will cut a great swathe through the northern<br />&gt; parts from Ole Sereni Hotel, through Hyena Dam, through Nagalomon Dam,<br />&gt; through Kisembe Forest, through Kingfisher Picnic Site and exit near<br />&gt; the Sheldrick Elephant Orphanage. All of the above named will be<br />&gt; changed forever, whether through the massive irrecoverable destruction<br />&gt; during construction, the loss of habitat and the disturbance to<br />&gt; wildlife caused by high speed trains speeding through the Park.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Hyena Dam, Nagalomon Dam and the Kisembe and Mokoyeti Rivers are the<br />&gt; water sources that keep the Park alive, the construction will alter<br />&gt; the water catchment of the Park and affect the entire western area.<br />&gt; Hyena and Nagalomon Dams are the most important wetlands for birds as<br />&gt; well as Hippos and other wildlife in the entire Park.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; The Kisembe Forest is the most important area for globally Critically<br />&gt; Endangered Black Rhinoceros as well as the most important area for the<br />&gt; very local Brachylaena and Olive forest in Kenya, which has all but<br />&gt; disappeared outside of its borders. The face that the Kenya Government<br />&gt; will be showing to the world is that it has no concern about the<br />&gt; continued existence of Black Rhinos in Kenya, and that any resemblance<br />&gt; to caring for the environment is merely façade.<br />&gt; The Kisembe Forest has a good variety of birds, and is now the major<br />&gt; area of White-backed Vulture breeding in East Africa. This is now a<br />&gt; critically endangered species, poised on the brink of extinction.<br />&gt; Notwithstanding that the forested areas along the Kisembe River is<br />&gt; without doubt the most scenically beautiful part of the entire Park.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; The Nairobi Pipit Anthus kisembensis, is found nowhere else in the<br />&gt; world, other than in this forest which is why its scientific name<br />&gt; bears the name of the forest and river. Ocassionally found in IUCN,<br />&gt; the population is endemic to Kisembe Ridge with the eastern limit just<br />&gt; beyond Ivory Burning Site. This entire species range is along the<br />&gt; proposed path for the railway. It may have been more widespread at one<br />&gt; time, but now has its only refuge in the Kisembe Forest, and only a<br />&gt; handful of pairs. No bird on the planet faces such a dire threat to<br />&gt; their continued existence, and its disappearance will be a suppurating<br />&gt; stain on the reputation of Kenya, as a country dedicated to the<br />&gt; protection of wildlife, …for ever.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; The dams in the glades around Kisembe Forest hold several pairs of the<br />&gt; Globally threatened Grey Crowned Cranes, fast disappearing throughout<br />&gt; their range as the habitat is changed, Nairobi National Park is a very<br />&gt; important and currently secure breeding habitat for this iconic<br />&gt; species with very high breeding success rate.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Returning to Vultures, throughout the range of the species the decline<br />&gt; in numbers over the past ten years has been between 90-95%. Everywhere<br />&gt; that is except for Nairobi National Park. Over these same ten years in<br />&gt; spite of the tumbling numbers of these once common birds, NNP has<br />&gt; remained stable. The vultures are still a common species, many pairs<br />&gt; successfully raise young in the Kisembe Forest requiring the tall<br />&gt; trees for nesting. The importance as a refuge for this species cannot<br />&gt; be overemphasised, the construction of the railway line, is this going<br />&gt; to be the nail in the coffin of White-backed Vulture in East Africa?<br />&gt; <br />&gt; On 12th December, I saw fourteen Ruppell’s Griffon Vultures together<br />&gt; which is a very encouraging sight. This species has suffered the same<br />&gt; fate as White-backed with 95% drop in numbers. In Kenya one of the<br />&gt; only two colonies at Hell’s Gate, has all but disappeared through<br />&gt; disturbance to the breeding site. Fourteen now represents a large<br />&gt; percentage of the birds that exist, and whilst they do not breed in<br />&gt; the Park, it is obviously an exceedingly important feeding refuge for<br />&gt; them. In other National Parks where vultures where once a common site,<br />&gt; very few to none are reported now.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; The gravity of the situation facing continued existence of all of<br />&gt; these species thanks to the sanctuary of Nairobi National Park must<br />&gt; not be taken lightly.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; The disturbance of the wildlife to the high-speed trains within the<br />&gt; Park cannot be calculated, but will certainly have a very drastic<br />&gt; series of repercussions that will detrimentally and adversely affect<br />&gt; them. Visitors to the Park will have to endure the sight and sounds<br />&gt; associated with the intrusion, the peaceful ambience will be shattered<br />&gt; never to return. The Park will receive fewer visitors as its<br />&gt; reputation as an eyesore with diminishing wildlife will<br />&gt; internationally pervade, and what then?<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Should you be able to contribute in making this a globally aware<br />&gt; crisis, please do endeavour to circulate because the Kenya Government<br />&gt; must be stopped from taking this huge step which will irreversibly<br />&gt; threaten the very existence of globally endangered species, as well as<br />&gt; the iconic Nairobi National Park itself.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Now the latest news……..<br />&gt; <br />&gt; At 6.40am Nigel Hunter and myself entered Nairobi National Park<br />&gt; through the Langata Gate where we rapidly completed the formalities<br />&gt; and were in the Park in no time having been expertly processed. There<br />&gt; had been no rain in a week, and everything was returning back to<br />&gt; normal enabling us to reach all the intended destinations. Throughout<br />&gt; the Park there was abundant verdant and tall pasture. Most of the day<br />&gt; was bright and sunny, getting hotter in the afternoon just before<br />&gt; there were a few heavy but brief showers.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Our first stop was the Vlei near the entrance, the grass was a bit<br />&gt; high for swamp species, although twenty Wood Sandpipers were present<br />&gt; and at least one Yellow Wagtail. Whilst looking at the open area, we<br />&gt; also found a Blackcap and two Willow Warblers in the bushes. There was<br />&gt; nothing at all on Hippogrebe Pond, when we continued the small circuit<br />&gt; back to the Kisembe bridge through the forest, our passage was<br />&gt; temporarily blocked by an enormous Black Rhinoceros which trotted off<br />&gt; into the bush, instantly fading from view.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; There was also nothing on the Langata Dam, although the days only<br />&gt; Common Whitethroat was along the road, and descending to Nagalomon Dam<br />&gt; we had our first of four Tawny Eagles, the first of two Bateleurs, and<br />&gt; first of four pairs of Grey Crowned Cranes. At the dam there was a<br />&gt; great deal of Sacred Ibis activity where the birds were nest building,<br />&gt; the Black-crowned Night-Herons which might also be nesting were more<br />&gt; discrete. In the typha was a female Little Bittern of unknown race,<br />&gt; and scattered Wood and Green Sandpipers along the margin. A Spotted<br />&gt; Thick-knee was back in the usual spot on the drift and from here to<br />&gt; the adjacent Ivory Burning Site there was a pale Booted Eagle (what<br />&gt; was probably the same bird was seen twice more during the morning).<br />&gt; This is my first for the season, and I have not heard of others. As a<br />&gt; visitor it is nearly two months late. In the bushes were several<br />&gt; Nightingales, a brief Spotted Flycatcher which was the only one today,<br />&gt; and a couple of Eurasian Bee-eaters with sunning Klaas’ Cuckoo and<br />&gt; male Variable Sunbird for close company (see image), and one Eastern<br />&gt; Honeybird was also present.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Taking the back road to Hyena Dam, there was a Sprosser singing along<br />&gt; the road in thick cover, but little else, nor was there actually much<br />&gt; on the new swamp, but Hyena Dam whilst it has lost some recent species<br />&gt; was still interesting. In the duck line were four White-faced<br />&gt; Whistling-Duck and a pair of Red-billed Teal, whilst wading birds<br />&gt; included the only African Spoonbill for the day, and although no<br />&gt; egrets other than Cattle, there were three Squacco Herons which could<br />&gt; very well be the first time three have been seen together in the Park.<br />&gt; Waders were few, apart from numerous Wood and Green Sandpipers there<br />&gt; were no other palearctic species, but the dam still held the five<br />&gt; Long-toed and three Spur-winged Plovers and two African Jacanas. The<br />&gt; days only Darter was flying over, they seem to have been displaced by<br />&gt; the crowding Sacred Ibis on Nagalomon Dam. Other birds were two<br />&gt; African Fish Eagles, two Purple Swamphen, though after the extravert<br />&gt; show last week, African Water Rails were neither seen nor heard, the<br />&gt; typha held two Sedge Warblers, one of which was in remarkably good<br />&gt; voice.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; We drove around to the Mokoyeti Bridge, where in the acacia woodland<br />&gt; were several Eurasian Bee-eaters, a noisy pair of Red-faced Cisticolas<br />&gt; (all ten species were seen again this week), a Brown Parisoma and the<br />&gt; only other Willow Warbler of the day. Continuing to Olmanyi Dam, the<br />&gt; only species was our only Little Grebe, and heading round to<br />&gt; Kingfisher were the only two Whinchats found today, but it was quite<br />&gt; quiet.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; By the burnt area were three confiding Shelley’s Francolins, but no<br />&gt; hoped for migrants here, and the murrum pits near Maasai Gate gave us<br />&gt; the first of only two Northern Wheatears, and first of five Turkestan<br />&gt; Shrikes. We stopped for lunch by the Mbagathi River below the Baboon<br />&gt; Cliffs, and the first Hildebrandt’s Francolin for a long time was<br />&gt; calling, although I hear they are regular at Emma-Coco just outside<br />&gt; the Park. The days only Common Buzzard was here and a couple of<br />&gt; Long-billed Pipits. On the flooded ford near the Mbagathi was an<br />&gt; attractive adult Striated Heron.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; The vulture-bathing pools above Athi Dam had just four White-backs but<br />&gt; it was too early for the main arrival, Horace Hippo was here but the<br />&gt; only bird was a Greenshank that seems to be here permanently.<br />&gt; Continuing on to Athi Dam was another Shelley’s Francolin, single<br />&gt; White-bellied and Hartlaub’s Bustards, a male Pied Wheatear and the<br />&gt; numerous open grassland species. Red-collared and Jackson’s are in<br />&gt; good numbers almost throughout the Park, but White-winged are very<br />&gt; scarce at present. Rosy-breasted Longclaws are also quite numerous and<br />&gt; we had three Pangani Longclaws. Athi Dam was accessible, and some mud<br />&gt; is starting to appear, there was a solitary White Stork, two Fish<br />&gt; Eagles that were not the birds seen at Hyena Dam in the morning, some<br />&gt; six Spur-winged and two Kittlitz’s Plovers, but with them a moulting<br />&gt; adult Little Ringed Plover, with seven Greenshank and four Common<br />&gt; Sandpipers.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; We looked at Rhino Circuit but did not find anything of note, then<br />&gt; continued to Cheetah Gate as far as the fallen Electricity Cable<br />&gt; across the road. Many vultures were congregating on the tops of trees<br />&gt; along the river, a remarkable sight of fourteen Ruppell’s Vultures<br />&gt; closely huddled amongst the White-backs. Nairobi National Park is very<br />&gt; likely the single most important refuge for these two vultures whose<br />&gt; populations continue to drop out of sight. Also it is fairly certain<br />&gt; that more White-backed Vultures nest in NNP that anywhere else in East<br />&gt; Africa (if not Africa), and they are very successful here.<br />&gt; Three Open-billed Storks were feeding in a flooded lugga, a Eurasian<br />&gt; Hobby appeared after the first shower, then a Kori Bustard was along<br />&gt; the roadside, one Laughing Dove was associating with Ring-necks, a<br />&gt; pair of African Hoopoes were cavorting, a pair of Red-and-Yellow<br />&gt; Barbets were duetting, and a pair of d’Arnaud’s Barbets were seen,<br />&gt; (all seven Barbet species were recorded today), the only Red-backed<br />&gt; Shrike of the day was a male, a Speckle-fronted Weaver was carrying<br />&gt; nest material, a stunning breeding pair of Lesser Masked Weavers fed<br />&gt; in acacia mellifera, and the days only Tree Pipit looked out of place<br />&gt; on top of an acacia mellifera as well.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Time now to return to Main Entrance, near the beacon in the grassy<br />&gt; valley an male Amur Falcon was attacking a female Montagu’s Harrier,<br />&gt; both male and female Pallid Harriers were skimming over the swathe,<br />&gt; the only Black-shouldered Kite today was here, and a pair of<br />&gt; Lappet-faced Vultures posed on a Balanites. A check of both Karen PC<br />&gt; Dam and Eland Hollow failed to produce, but nearby on the more<br />&gt; recently burnt area (last year) were three Temminck’s Coursers. A last<br />&gt; stop at Hyena Dam before leaving resulted in a Lesser Kestrel flying<br />&gt; by, what looked like last weeks female Western Marsh Harrier was<br />&gt; hunting over the area, but the nicest find was an adult Great Spotted<br />&gt; Eagle which is almost certainly the bird that lived here early in the<br />&gt; year from January to March.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Barn Swallows were scattered but no large concentrations, only a few<br />&gt; pairs of Lesser Striped Swallows and not many Red-rumped. The<br />&gt; grasslands are teaming with small Cisticolas with Desert being heard<br />&gt; throughout, but of course Pectoral-patch greatly outnumbered them.<br />&gt; However the commonest bird of the day was in all likelihood Siffling<br />&gt; Cisticola, which come out of the woodwork when breeding season in<br />&gt; here, although undoubtedly present all year. The total number of<br />&gt; species recorded today was 207, though some amazingly common birds<br />&gt; were just never encountered. Just to put the Parks diversity into<br />&gt; perspective, last Saturday we recorded a staggering 51 species not<br />&gt; recorded today!!!<br />&gt; <br />&gt; We were through the gate at 5.40pm having had a superb day albeit with<br />&gt; a slow start.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Mammals were largely along the Mbagathi, and as is usual many had left<br />&gt; the Park after the rains. Last week the place appeared full of Eland,<br />&gt; but today we did not see one! The only Lion was right near the Hippo<br />&gt; Pools. A Serval crept through long grass near Maasai Gate, and Suni<br />&gt; were plentiful in the forest, although repeatedly reported as<br />&gt; Dik-Diks!<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Best to all<br />&gt; Brian<br />&gt; <br />&gt; MONTAGE FOR 12TH DECEMBER 2015-12-12<br />&gt; <br />&gt; TOP LEFT<br />&gt; An amazingly colourful assemblage of unrelated species at Ivory Burning Site.<br />&gt; (Eurasian Bee-eater, Klaas’ Cuckoo and Variable Sunbird.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; TOP MIDDLE<br />&gt; Unusual front view of female African Hoopoe.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; TOP RIGHT<br />&gt; Welcome back to the adult Great Spotted Eagle!<br />&gt; <br />&gt; BOTTOM LEFT<br />&gt; Part of the congregation of globally important numbers of Ruppell’s Vultures.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; BOTTOM MIDDLE<br />&gt; Moulting adult Little Ringed Plover at Athi Dam.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; BOTTOM RIGHT<br />&gt; Croaking Cisticola male with diagnostically heavy bill.<br />&gt;</p>
