    The <a href="http://kenyabirdmap.adu.org.za/">Kenya Bird Map</a>
    project is nearing the end of its first full calendar year since it
    has been running with the management office set up in the Museum,
    Nairobi. All those who have taken part have contributed to now
    almost 400 atlas squares ('pentads') covered in total (we need just
    8 more) and 300 pentads for 2015 (only 14 more needed) and 60,000
    records submitted (only 434 records needed... and there are still 10
    days left in the year for anyone reading this in Kenya to be able to
    help meet those targets!). <br>
    <br>
    This is a superb effort and sets an excellent baseline and challenge
    for the next year to see how quickly we can better it - but more
    than that it provides an solid basis of data upon which to build for
    analysing and tracking changes in bird populations. A <a
      href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2989/00306525.2015.1089333">recent
      paper in Ostrich</a> highlights how the data collected in the
    South African Bird Atlas Project really does allow for accurate
    assessment of population declines in Martial Eagles. This is exactly
    the same protocol that is being used for Kenya Bird Map - and thus
    the data you have collected will allow for similar such assessments
    of threatened species. <br>
    <br>
    An additional reason why the Kenya Bird Map is important is
    illustrated in the recent submission of a record of an Egyptian
    Vulture (now officially (?) considered 'Critically Endangered' since
    Darcy et al's paper on vulture declines) on the shores of Lake
    Turkana. This record makes twelve records of this species in the
    database<b><font color="#cc0000"></font></b> - data which are openly
    available to anyone visiting the website. Click on <a
      href="http://kenyabirdmap.adu.org.za/species_info.php?spp=111">this
      link to see the species map</a>Â  - turn the different protocol
    layers on and off using the 'Tools' icons (the pop-up label is
    correct only for the first icon "Show the pentads layer". The second
    icon shows / hides the 'Ad hoc' records layer, the third shows /
    hide the 'Incidental records' layer). <br>
    <br>
    Another example of a species map is this for the <a
      href="http://kenyabirdmap.adu.org.za/species_info.php?spp=430#menu_left">Southern
      Ground Hornbill</a> - you will note on this one when turning the
    'incidental record' layer on that there are lot of records showing
    in Tanzania. If you zoom out to the map of Africa level, you'll see
    the distribution of records for wherever they've been submitted -
    mostly southern Africa and Kenya. <br>
    <br>
    Thank you again to all who have contributed so far - this is an
    incredible resource for conserving our birds in Kenya. Don't stop
    now and we would welcome all and anyone else to join in as well -
    write to <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:kenyabirdmap@naturekenya.org">kenyabirdmap@naturekenya.org</a> to register. The free Android
    smart phone app by BirdLasser designed specifically around atlassing
    with the KBM protocol is a superb resource for making the atlassing
    significantly easier - again, write to the same email address to be
    sent the link for it (it will soon be available on the Google store
    but for now can be obtained through the KBM office). <br>
    <br>
    Wishing all a wonderful Christmas.<br>
    <br>
