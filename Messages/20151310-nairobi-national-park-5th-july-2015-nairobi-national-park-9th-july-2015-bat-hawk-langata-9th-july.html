  <pre>NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 5th July 2015

Dear All,
On 5th July Rupert Watson kindly escorted Fleur Ngâ€™Weno, Jennifer
Oduore and myself for a full day in the Park. We all met up at Langata
Gate which was fully operational and were expertly processed and soon
in the Park.

The weather was magical, bright and sunny all day, but there was a
coolness in the air so it remained comfortable all day. Grey Crowned
Cranes were on nests at both Langata Gate Dam and Forest Edge Dam,
additional birds were only at the latter with a Little Grebe and large
young, a Yellow-billed Egret and a single Lesser Moorhen reduced from
the six there a few weeks ago. We continue through the forest with a
single Brown-backed Woodpecker, few small parties of Violet-backed
Starlings, the surprise of an obliging Pygmy Kingfisher enjoying the
sunlight and a White-starred Robin. From here we descended to
Kingfisher where there was nothing until a flock of 120 Open-billed
Storks appeared and continued on. Certainly the largest gathering of
this species I have ever seen in the Park, but a pair of
Speckle-fronted Weavers here looked a bit out of place.
