  <pre>OK, it&#39;s not a bird

Nevertheless, delighted to report that we saw a cheetah on the murram stacks
between numbers 7 and 8 in Nairobi National Park on 5 September, the first
in many years. When we reported it at the gate, we were told it had been
seen several times in the past three days. Did KWS translocate it, or did it
arrive on its own?

Also, to celebrate Vulture Awareness Day, some 20 White-backed Vultures
roosting in the acacias near the salt lick between 13 and 14.

Good birding, Fleur
