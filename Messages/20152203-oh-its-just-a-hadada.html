  <pre>Dear All,
“Oh, it’s just a Hadada.” How often we hear that, given with a voice
reflecting both scorn and disappointment. I am guilty myself.

Now look at the image of a bird I took this evening in the garden, the
sun is low but fully illuminating it, and the bird is also perched up
on a small stack of hay, just slightly lower than the camera. Take a
look at the image in fine detail, from tail to shoulders and tell me
if this underated and such familiar bird is not in fact worthy of
ranking amongst the top most attractive birds in Africa!

Best for now
Brian
