  Hi all, it has been good time with me here at Tana Delta with my fellow staff working At Tana Delta.<br>The reason for is that i am on my way out from Tan delta after my accomplishes of my contract of 3 years with Nature Kenya, hoping to be updating the birds of Arabuko Sokoke forest as my home area. what i have achieved is i have my two fellow bird lovers at office who are quite keen on birding, stops me to identify the bird on the tree, Wire, ground and at the river bank. after identify the bird the first thing they do is refer from guide book at the office then they add to their list.<br>This has real encouraged me alot and i feel happy at least i have pass my knowledge to others.<br>Today as we were crossing the river Tana from Kipao village where we drover on the other side we stop on the stream with little water where a common sand piper was feeding on the sand and left after identify it then came a collared Pranticole this real fascinate me to see it as it was drinking water. my friends shouted look which bird is that. The two birds of today the 6th of March were their lifers.<br>Good birding<br><p><span><br class="yui-cursor"></span></p>
