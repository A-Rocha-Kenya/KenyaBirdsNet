  <hr/>
  on the 22 of may i and my three friends left Gede heading to Tana Delta to do research on Malindi pipit. what were keen on is to do transects and counting the numbers this was done by two people and the other people were dealing with questioners on the Malindi pipit to local community living near the sites we find the bird.<br>The Villages we worked with are Duru village in chalaluma where the two community Pokomo and Orma leaving opposite side divided by roat Tarasaa Ozi road. The questioners were filled and we had eleven elders for Focus group discussion. the knowledge of birds was existing and culture of the importance of birds in the culture were well defined.<br>The second village was Ozi village where we had the same sessions and here the members of site support group who have knowledge of bird was real fascinating and encouraging to see what we talk being known.<br>Our last day which was on 26 th may we went for Boat trip from Ozi to mbililo and back to ozi. this tim the water was high as the river was flooding, were had number of birds on our way. our most interest was to reach at Mbililo where grassland is found to see if we can see Malindi pipit, it was waoo we set one transect and found seven malindi pipits. we tried to move around and we had a challenge of floods on grasslands all over.<br>what else observed was cattle camps at high marks. <br>My question to all is that from the communitytalks about the birds of Delta, where ducks such as whistling ducks are being shoot by hunters with license by KWS is this true and if so what measure should be done.<br>please lets help<br>Good birding<br>Jonathan Mwachongo <br><p><span><br class="yui-cursor"></span></p>
