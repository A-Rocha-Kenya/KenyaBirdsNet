  i have been observing on this swallows during my visits at Moa since last year between 3pm 6pm the different species roost on the electric wire. the difference i saw yesterday is that the number has increased than before.<br>lots of barn swallows, lesser striped swallows and wire tail swallows.<br>I hope the next time i try to estimate the number in order to monitor the population as well the activity they do most<br>Thank you<br>Good birding<br><p><span><br class="yui-cursor"></span></p>
