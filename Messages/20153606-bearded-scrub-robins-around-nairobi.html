  <div dir="ltr"><div><div><div><div><div>Hallo all,<br><br></div>This afternoon we were all amazed at what Kelvin Gichuki had found at the National Museums of Kenya. At the bushes below the lower Nature Kenya office, was a Bearded Scrub Robin. The first known record from the NMK.<br></div>The excitement was real, and many birders from the Ornithology section came to witness the new visitor, after Peter Muriithi of Nature Kenya invited us to the sighting. <br><br></div><div>This sighting comes less than a month after my sighting at Ol-donyo Sabuk, not far from Nairobi, kindly see the photo below. I saw two birds on separate trips last month, which could well be the same individual seen on both trips. My bird seemed older and brighter than this one from NMK though.<br><br></div>Now, the major question is, are there BSRs in Nairobi that we had not discovered before? Or are they here because it is warmer and drier in Nairobi now? Or are they just extending their ranges?<br><br></div>Kind regards,<br></div>Washington Wachira. <br clear="all"><div><div><div><div><div><div><br>-- <br><div class="gmail_signature"><div dir="ltr"><div><div dir="ltr"><div><div dir="ltr">Washington Wachira<br><br><a href="http://washingtonwachira.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://washingtonwachira.blogspot.com/</a><br><br>P.O Box 1930-20117<br>Naivasha, Kenya<br><br>+254 711 706 450<br></div></div></div></div></div></div>
