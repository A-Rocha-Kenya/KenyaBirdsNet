<DIV>Greetings birders</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Nature Kenya held four days of field training in bird identification for 
members of the Tana Delta Conservation Network March 17-20, 2015. It was very 
dry and dusty and water levels in wetlands were low, but many birds were 
observed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Migrants included Grasshopper Buzzards, Eurasian Rollers, Northern Carmine 
and White-throated Bee-eaters, Barn Swallows and Sand Martins (all Eurasian or 
intra-African migrants) feasting on roast grasshoppers and other insects at a 
grass fire.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Red-capped Robin-Chat, migrants from the south, were clearly seen Buboya 
Forest in Ndera Conservancy on 19 March. Forest birds in this forest fragment 
included Fischer’s Turaco, African Pygmy Kingfisher, Scaly-throated Honeyguide, 
Square-tailed Drongo, Little Yellow Flycatcher, Black-headed Apalis, Eastern 
Nicator, Black-bellied Starling, Red-tailed Ant Thrush, Bearded Scrub Robin and 
Dark-backed Weaver. The group also had excellent views of Tana River Red Colobus 
monkeys.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The boat trip up the River Tana was amazing as always, despite the low 
water levels. Over one thousand Spur-winged Plovers lined the sandbanks. The 
banks of “lake” Mbililo included a pond with sedges and were teeming with birds: 
an estimated 100 Spur-winged Geese, 120 Yellow-billed Storks, 150 African 
Open-billed Storks, over 70 African Spoonbills, 350 Cattle Egrets (including 
those seen on the way), 30 Pink-backed Pelicans, 3 immature Greater Flamingo and 
best of all, 52 African Skimmers.</DIV>
