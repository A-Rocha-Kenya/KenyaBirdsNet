 was rather hoping to join Fleur and other birders on Sunday for the 
potluck as they were in my larger neighbourhood.  However, my son vetoed
 that plan so I decided to bird around my compound where I live in 
Thika. <br><br></div>At the end of the morning I had recorded 
approximately 50 species.  I&#39;m closing in on recording 100 species 
within the compound.  <br><br></div>Although I didn&#39;t record anywhere 
near a daily high number of species, some were Thika specialties (at 
least they are easiest to see in Thika if you live around Nairobi) and a
 couple were particular highlights.<br><br></div><div>The usual Thika group included African golden weaver and Hinde&#39;s babblers. <br></div><div><br></div>The
 first species of note was Red and Yellow Barbet.  I have seen a pair 
around this compound about 4 years ago, but its not a species I see with
 any regularity. <br><br></div>I then mucked through a wetland only to 
find some pools of small fish.  The biggest being at most 10 cm.  I&#39;ve 
attached a photo if anyone know which species they may be. <br><br></div>Then
 two great sparrowhawks, one of which was a juvenile, were calling 
loudly from a very small remnant forest patch.  I tried tracking them 
down for a photo, but in vain. <br><br></div>At least they lead me in 
the direction of the find of the day, which caught my attention as it 
was calling, but it was certainly a call I didn&#39;t not recognise.  It was
 a male Narina Trogon and it made my day!  I&#39;m wondering if any have 
been recorded recently in and around Thika?<br><br></div>While walking 
back to my house, thirsty but elated, a large shadow appeared on the 
ground in front of me.  Suspecting it to be a crow, I was happily 
surprised to see it was a Lanner falcon. <br><br></div>I can&#39;t imagine there&#39;s too many pentads that have both R&amp;Y barbets and Narina Trogons.<br><br></div>I
 also photographed this female white-winged widowbird?  see 3 attached 
photos.  I&#39;d appreciate if anyone could identify it with certainty. <br><br></div>The
 white butterflies (capers?) were moving through in numbers.  Also 
photographed were resident Syke&#39;s monkeys, ochre tree squirrel and some 
dragonflies.<br><br></div><br></div>Cheers, Darcy<br><br><img alt="Inline image 4" src="cid:ii_14ff08b5cf3d58d2" height="274" width="412"><img alt="Inline image 7" src="cid:ii_14ff08c274f7fee7" height="274" width="412"><img alt="Inline image 3" src="cid:ii_14ff08b30ec7c306" height="309" width="412"><br><img alt="Inline image 8" src="cid:ii_14ff08c5a2b12835" height="309" width="412"><br clear="all"><br><div dir="ltr"><div><div dir="ltr"><div><div dir="ltr"><div><div dir="ltr"><div><div dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:tahoma,sans-serif"><span style="border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:0px"><span style="border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:0px"><span style="border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:0px"><span style="border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:0px"><span style="border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:0px"><span style="border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:0px"><span style="border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:0px"></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br><br><img alt="Inline image 11" src="cid:ii_14ff08c98770d437" height="354" width="472"><img alt="Inline image 10" src="cid:ii_14ff08c86ac39551" height="309" width="412"><img alt="Inline image 9" src="cid:ii_14ff08c733e800f1" height="309" width="412"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
