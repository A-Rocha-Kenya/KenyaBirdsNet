  <pre>Greetings birders

In the last two weeks we have recorded some remarkable totals of birds
observed on Nature Kenya&#39;s Wednesday Morning Birdwalks: 69 species at
Paradise Lost, and 61 species at Karura Forest. Both sites include wetlands
and grassland as well as forest. We also recorded 67 species at Paradise
Lost on June 10th. 

These are really good totals for cold grey days with no migrants! Of course
having experienced participants and careful recorders helps a lot. Thanks to
all who keep the lists for the Wednesday Morning Birdwalks and Kenya Bird
Map.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
