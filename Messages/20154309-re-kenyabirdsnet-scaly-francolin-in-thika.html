  <pre>Hi Darcy,
Scaly Francolins are resident in rank lantana growth on the KARI
compound, on the left just down from Blue Posts,
best for now

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; Late this afternoon I glanced out the window to see a Scaly Francolin waddle
&gt; by followed almost immediately by a pair of Egyptian mongoose.  They quickly
&gt; went out of sight.  About a minute later the francolin passed by in the
&gt; opposite direction minus the mongoose.  I was rather surprised to find this
&gt; species in the garden of my (new) house.  For those of you who knew my old
&gt; house, we&#39;ve moved closer to town and now live in Del Monte&#39;s Imani
&gt; compound, which is a much larger compound and has a tiny piece of indigenous
&gt; forest along a tributary to the Chania river.  I guess this is why this
&gt; species is still around here, as otherwise we are so close to Thika town and
&gt; surrounded by pineapples.
&gt; Cheers, Darcy
