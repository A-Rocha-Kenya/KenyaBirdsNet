  <pre>Dear All,
I was up in the paddock at 6.50am this morning and the female Bat Hawk
was already there. The cold gloom was back as I am sure everyone found
out in Nairobi on waking up this morning. She gave up waiting for a
bit of sun and left at 7.25am leaving me back to wondering what I was
doing up there in the cold grey loom,
Best to all
Brian
