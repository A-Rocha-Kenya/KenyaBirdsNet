<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Just back from Tsavo Eas. My main task was 
finding&nbsp;lions and elephants etc&nbsp;for my&nbsp;young grandson but I did 
manage to&nbsp;see some birds.&nbsp; Lots of migrants especially Harriers, 
Montague and Pallid.&nbsp; They were busy hunting over the lush grasslands 
around Satao camp.&nbsp; I'm afraid the immature and the females defeated 
me&nbsp;for definite ID&nbsp;as I was never able to see them for long 
enough.&nbsp; Lots of Eurasian Rollers and Spotted flycatchers. Large number of 
yellow wagtails at Aruba Dam. Hundreds of White Storks both on the dam at Satao 
and spread&nbsp;over all the grasslands.&nbsp; A pair of Eurasian Black Storks 
at Satao dam, one adult and one juvenile</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>A good sight was a group of vultures feeding on an 
old carcase - 6 White-backed, 2 Lappet-faced and 1 Egyptian vulture.&nbsp; 
Egyptian was being harassed by the others who did not tolerate it feeding on the 
carcase.&nbsp; It&nbsp; had one or two attempts and then retired to a nearby 
tree.&nbsp; Was nice to see one as I haven't seen one for ages.</FONT></DIV>
