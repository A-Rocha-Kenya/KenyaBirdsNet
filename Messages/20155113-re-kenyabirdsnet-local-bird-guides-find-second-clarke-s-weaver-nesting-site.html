      <p>Greetings birders<br>
<br>
Julio Mwambire and Japhet Garama of Dakatcha Woodland Conservation Group<br>
(DWCG) have found the second confirmed breeding site for Clarke¹s Weavers in<br>
the world. Like the first breeding site, it is in Dakatcha Woodland<br>
Important Bird Area northwest of Malindi.<br>
<br>
During monthly bird monitoring organized by Nature Kenya, Mwambire and<br>
Garama recorded large flocks of Clarke¹s Weavers at Munyenzeni wetland near<br>
Bore viewpoint in late April, but no breeding activity.<br>
<br>
Then on 9 May 2015, Mwambire and Garama found Clarke&#39;s Weavers building<br>
nests among the sedges in a pool of the seasonal Gandi River.<br>
 <br>
On May 21 and 22, Rupi Mangat, Catherine Ngarachu, Brian Wambua, Albert Baya<br>
and I joined Mwambire, Garama, Peter Wario and Samson Katisho of DWCG on to<br>
view this second Clarke¹s Weaver breeding site. The sedge-filled pool in the<br>
Gandi River was busy with weavers. We could see male and female Clarke¹s<br>
Weavers sitting in the tops of the sedges, and estimated about 80 Clarke¹s<br>
Weaver nests. Some of the birds were shivering their wings, apparently in<br>
display. There were also a number of Grosbeak Weavers with nests, and flocks<br>
of Red-headed and Red-billed Queleas.<br>
 <br>
Male and female Clarke¹s Weavers flew and off and soon returned with food in<br>
their beaks to feed the young in the nests. The adults brought mainly<br>
insects, including caterpillars and grasshoppers. They continued to bring<br>
food all morning, and the next day we watched them bringing food in the<br>
afternoon. <br>
 <br>
Yesterday, June 11, Julio Mwambire reported &quot;Now young ones flying around<br>
perching on the shrubs in the wetland and the bushes, in small flocks<br>
joining adults flying to the feeding grounds&quot;.<br>
<br>
It seems that we can report a successful Clarke&#39;s Weaver breeding event in<br>
Dakatcha Woodland IBA.<br>
<br>
Wishing you good birding, Fleur<br>
<br>
