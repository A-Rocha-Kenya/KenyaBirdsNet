Great to see the Karen Bird Walk going strong!<BR>
<BR>
Good point below about overlooked birds, such as Brown-backed Woodpecker which is common in leafy gardens and other forested habitats in Nairobi.<BR>
<BR>
But Scarce Swift? I don&#8217;t think we get Scarce Swift in Nairobi. It might be confused with White-rumped Swift, whose white rump is often difficult to see.<BR>
<BR>
Wishing you all good birding, Fleur<BR>

Hi Patrick &amp; Mike, <BR>
<BR>
Thanks for those comments. Patrick, I agree that the Brown-backed Woodpecker is fairly common throughout the forested areas of Karen, and elsewhere in Nairobi.<BR>
<BR>
To expand on my comments about it being more common around Nairobi than is supposed, I think it is one of a group of species that can be underreported because it has some resemblance to a similar species that is more common - in this case, the Cardinal Woodpecker - and it takes a certain level of awareness by even experienced birders to sort them out. <BR>
<BR>
Others in this category could include Thick-billed Seedeater (Streaky Seedeater), Red-faced Cisticola (Singing Cisticola), Scarce Swift (Palm Swift), Collared Sunbird (Variable Sunbird), and Slender-billed Greenbul (various canopy warblers). <BR>
<BR>
An interesting point for discussion!!<BR>
<BR>
All best, JD<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
Karen club is always a great place for bird walks and it sounds like you saw many of the usuals.<BR>
<BR>
To add further to the brown backed woodpecker sightings, we live on Westwood park road not far from the dukas and we always have them in the fig trees in our garden. A very common species for us so I would suspect they are fairly common throughout forested areas of Karen?<BR>
<BR>
Cheers<BR>

Interesting about the Brown-backed Woodpecker .  It is quite often seen on the Wednesday bird walk i Ngong forest , so no reason why it should not be on the course !<BR>
