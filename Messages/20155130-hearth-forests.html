  <pre> This is  just part of the ecological importances of hearth forests among others. here in kenya It is dominantly found in mt kenya national park, checking the mt kenya topo MAP sheet 120/02?. it is a scatly distributed bush forest along state lounge areas.and some in meru areas along old moses( currently like 10% scattered hearth is existing in that area due to wild fires 15years ago)in its place invasive species has occupied thousand of the burned areas.in state lounge area(same map sheet) 80% of that forest cover was bunt down by the wild fire which burnt down the forest cover for at least 2months starting from february of 2012.invisive species have already colonized the best part of the burnt down areas.the hearth do not have tap roots so their desidous roots help purify,channel water down stream,tributaries and collect soil particles and to slow the water speed before collecting to streams, tributaries and form some rivers in mt kenya(mooreland acts
 as a large water collecting basket which can store water for some period due to well turcass grass cover which helps too in low loss of vapour from evaporation),currently alot of  the exposed soil after the loss of the hearth cover is washed down streams or forcing water to divert to wrong course such that it does not enter the water route chanells and not feeding the rivers with enough waters. the waters may get down to non polous soil too.this is evident due to high soil washout after well turcass grass cover in the moorlands could hold water from rains for a longer period before the loss of this hearth cover.turcuss grass helps the corrected water after rains to move down stream slowly, it was evident that slow moving water channels could be noted for a long period even after long dry period feeding the nearby formed streams,but with loss of hearth bush ,water flow at a high speed down the valleys or to the forests without brockage  to control the
 speed and in to different directions and tapidity is evident.
.   some hearth too can be found in aberedares national park
