They were both doing their nuthatch-like feeding style of probing under the lichens as they scooted up and around a tall tree. <br><img alt="Inline image 1" src="cid:ii_14fa2f48446f10ad" height="309" width="412"><img alt="Inline image 2" src="cid:ii_14fa2f501dfe0a22" height="354" width="472"><br><div><div><div><br><br></div><div>I also managed this rather distant photo of a montane white-eye.  As further support that despite the top of this mountain being only c. 2100m the forests at the top support montane species.  <br><img alt="Inline image 1" src="cid:ii_14fa6d4b4a34f760" height="354" width="472"><br><br>Other non-montane species were groups of cabinis&#39;s greenbul, and singles of augur buzzard, yellow-rumped tinkerbird, brown-crowned tchagra.<br><br></div><div>On the mammal side of things, I did manage to see and photograph a troop of colobus monkeys.  While seeing them there wasn&#39;t surprising, I can&#39;t recall ever having run into them before on the mountain.  <br></div><div>Others were syke&#39;s monkeys and baboons heard from afar, and dwarf mongoose. <br></div><div><br></div><div>While Ol Donyo is not the easiest park to see birds, it has a lovely bit of forest at the top and apart from some semi-drunk hikers I didn&#39;t encounter anyone else.  Karibu Thika!<br><br></div><div>Cheers, Darcy<br></div><div><br clear="all"></div><div><div><br><br></div></div></div></div></div>
