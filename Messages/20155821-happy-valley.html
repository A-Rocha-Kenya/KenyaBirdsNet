licentiousness in the minds of many, to yours truly, it is a reminder of the
serenity experienced whenever I go birding in the valley/wetland within the
vicinity of my home.</div><div class="" id="yui_3_16_0_1_1445420750887_3435"><br></div><div class="" id="yui_3_16_0_1_1445420750887_3437">During the month of September, I had numerous opportunities
to walk through the aforementioned valley. During these times, I have
photographed birds, flowers, butterflies and even a spider on the hunt. Perhaps
my favourite image would be that of the African Pygmy Kingfisher,one of the most beautiful birds I have ever seen. As
it has been said before, in nature photography the image is always given, never
taken. Indeed, this little beau is a testament to this fact.</div><div class="" id="yui_3_16_0_1_1445420750887_3437"><br></div><div class="" id="yui_3_16_0_1_1445420750887_3439">Several white-eyes were also at hand to offer me some good
images. It is quite tricky to distinguish between the Abyssinian, Montane and
yellow white-eye in the field as was noted in the Annual Kenya Birding
Magazine. Nonetheless, equipped with a camera, I find it easier to study the
images more closely thereafter to make these distinctions but even so, I often
wonder whether I have identified them correctly. </div><div class="" id="yui_3_16_0_1_1445420750887_3439"><br></div><div class="" id="yui_3_16_0_1_1445420750887_3441" dir="ltr">I also caught sight of what I believe to be the lesser swamp
warbler, a marsh warbler and a third I couldn't quite place (attached as which bird). However, am not sure whether I have
identified them correctly. I welcome more experienced birders to have a look at
them.</div><div class="" id="yui_3_16_0_1_1445420750887_3441"><br></div><div class="" id="yui_3_16_0_1_1445420750887_3443">All in all, it has been a good month of birding and here are some images ‘given’ during this period. October looks to be a better month
since I have joined Nature Kenya and if the walk on last Wednesday in the Arboretum
was anything to go by it seems I am in for a very good birding treat.</div><div class="" id="yui_3_16_0_1_1445420750887_3443"><br></div><div class="" id="yui_3_16_0_1_1445420750887_3445">Happy birding everyone</div><div class="" id="yui_3_16_0_1_1445420750887_3445"><br></div><div class="" id="yui_3_16_0_1_1445420750887_3445">Evans Toroitich</div><div class="" id="yui_3_16_0_1_1445420750887_3447"><o:p id="yui_3_16_0_1_1445420750887_3449" class="">&nbsp;</o:p></div><div class="" id="yui_3_16_0_1_1445420750887_3451"><o:p id="yui_3_16_0_1_1445420750887_3453" class="">&nbsp;</o:p></div><div class="" id="yui_3_16_0_1_1445420750887_3455"><o:p id="yui_3_16_0_1_1445420750887_3457" class="">&nbsp;</o:p></div><div class="" id="yui_3_16_0_1_1445420750887_3459"><o:p id="yui_3_16_0_1_1445420750887_3461" class="">&nbsp;</o:p></div><div id="yui_3_16_0_1_1445420750887_3391">
