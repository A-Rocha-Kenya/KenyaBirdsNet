  <p dir="ltr">Great photo Brian.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Amazing color reflectance.<br>
You remind me of my BirdWalks in Kenyatta university, I used to say that to Pied Crows. Until I found one chasing my first Lanner Falcon of the area.<br>
I was so amazed at it&#39;s flight maneouver that I for once wished I had a camera at hand to record the moment.<br>
Happy Easter weekend.</p>

      <p>Dear All,<br>
“Oh, it’s just a Hadada.” How often we hear that, given with a voice<br>
reflecting both scorn and disappointment. I am guilty myself.<br>
<br>
Now look at the image of a bird I took this evening in the garden, the<br>
sun is low but fully illuminating it, and the bird is also perched up<br>
on a small stack of hay, just slightly lower than the camera. Take a<br>
look at the image in fine detail, from tail to shoulders and tell me<br>
if this underated and such familiar bird is not in fact worthy of<br>
ranking amongst the top most attractive birds in Africa!<br>
<br>
Best for now<br>
Brian<br>
