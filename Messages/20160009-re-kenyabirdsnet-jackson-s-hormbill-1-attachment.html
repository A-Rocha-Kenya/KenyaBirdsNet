    <p>Hi James, <br>
    </p>
    <p>This is indeed very interesting - can you give us the exact date
      and location you photographed the bird?</p>
    <p>Are you signed up for the <a
        href="http://kenyabirdmap.adu.org.za/">Kenya Bird Map</a>
      project and <a href="http://vmus.adu.org.za/">Virtual Museum</a>?
      (there is only one registration for both). If so, please submit
      the record as an incidental record to the Bird Map but then also
      upload the photograph to the 'Birdpix' section of the Virtual
      Museum so that it is kept as a 'specimen' for all and anyone to
      look at and reference. <br>
    </p>
    <p>The Virtual Museum is an excellent way of putting photographs of
      birds online and sharing them with anyone so that they can
      identified by experts and kept as a permanent future reference -
      especially rarities or out of range records. Please do use it for
      uploading any other photos you have of birds (and the wide range
      of other animals and plants it can accept). If you're not
      registered with the projects, let me know and I can easily do so
      for you.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Thanks, <br>
    </p>
    <p>Colin</p>

            <p><span>On my way back from Watamu in August I passed
                through Tsavo East and drove along the Galana River.
                 Took a picture of the attached bird which I initially
                thought was a Van-der-Dekens female.  After discovering
                that it could be a Jacksons Female albeit a country mile
                outside its normal range I have spent two months looking
                at picures, reading up every scrap of information and
                sharing it with everyone I could think of. 99% sure this
                is a Jacksons seen in Tsavo East.    Brian Finch and
                Mike Davidson asked me to post it here as apparently
                there is no record of any sighting east of the rift
                valley.</span></p>
