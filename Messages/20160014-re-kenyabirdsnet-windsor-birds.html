  <pre>Hi Jonathan,
That&#39;s interesting that the breeding activity of Sacred Ibis suddenly
stopped recently. It&#39;s the same in NNPark, from dominating Nagalomon
Dam to breeding all over. I had always assumed that the Ibis around
Nairobi bred for much of the year, but maybe they do actually have a
particular season,
Best for now
Brian

&gt; in breeding season and at least 10 Eurasian Bee- eaters, Spekes Weavers
&gt; males singing and African Golden Weavers making nest where the Sacred Ibis
&gt; had nested for the last 5 month.
&gt;  Great birding
