Naivasha</title></head><body>
<div>Dear&nbsp; Gladys;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So sorry to hear of your
disappointing visit to Naivasha last weekend, but it is an all too
familiar a story now.&nbsp; The effects of an unregulated fishing
industry has had a truly disastrous impact on all water birds there,
and one really wonders what the future holds for Naivasha.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Our lake of
international importance now faces an uncertain future, and it could
well become an environmental disaster. Proliferating unplanned
settlements and land conversions within the Ramsar site continue to
negatively impact the already fragile ecosystem owing to the lack of
development planning procedures. Although the law is clear on many
issues, an overall lack of enforcement renders existing statutes
ineffective. Without any meaningful law enforcement, this ecosystem
with its finite resources cannot sustain for much longer the
ever-increasing pressures from a population increasing at over 3% per
annum.</font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000"><br></font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Given that the
government has ear-marked Naivasha District for further development,
increased geothermal power and for the establishment of several
industrial estates, the question therefore remains:&nbsp; Who in
Government is willing to take responsibility and care sufficiently to
ensure a co-ordinated effort is implemented that restores the
lakes's biodiversity heritage and provides a better environmental
platform for sustaining the activities that occur around the lake both
now and in the future. Failure to do this could result in not just
continued environmental damage, but also a sharp decline in the
economic wellbeing of everyone living and working there.</font></div>
