    Very interesting! This is exactly the sort of change that the Kenya
    Bird Map will pick up with many species that have changed their
    distribution as records are submitted. <br>
    <br>
    Brian - can you submit this record to the Bird Map? <br>

            <p>Dear All,<br>
              I have just received the attached superb images from Kevin
              Easley, who<br>
              photographed the birds at their nest at Archer’s Gate
              entrance to<br>
              Samburu GR last November.<br>
              <br>
              They are unquestionably nominate Somali Sparrows, and
              coexisting with<br>
              House Sparrows. This is as amazing as the discovery of the
              birds at<br>
              Sala Gate Tsavo East.<br>
              <br>
              It would seem that the species is spreading, and maybe
              they are<br>
              already at other sites but so far unrecorded..<br>
              <br>
              Best to all<br>
              Brian<br>
