     I have just received the email below from the Kenya Bird Map office
    and wanted to share it with as many Kenyan birders as possible.<a
      href="http://kenyabirdmap.adu.org.za/"> </a><br>
    <br>
    <a href="http://kenyabirdmap.adu.org.za/">The Kenya Bird Map</a> now
    stands at 421 pentads (atlas squares) covered which is over 6% of
    the country. A significant number of these have had more than 4
    cards (lists) submitted for them which then allows for some
    interesting analysis using reporting rates of species (on the <a
      href="http://kenyabirdmap.adu.org.za/coverage.php#menu_top">coverage
      map page</a>, these are pentads that are coloured green). <br>
    <br>
    Do join us in this birding initiative which will allow us to
    understand how our birds are distributed and know their status and
    contribute to conserving them. Atlassing is also a heck of a lot of
    fun to do - and the BirdLasser app makes it so much easier to do and
    therefore enjoy. <br>
    <br>
    Thanks again to the BirdLasser team for all the effort put into
    developing this superb app and to the Swiss Embassy in Nairobi for
    providing the funds to cover the develop costs. <br>

      <p class="MsoNormal">Here is a game changer for bird mapping in
        Kenya. The SMART
        PHONE  BirdMapping APP is now available for Kenya. It is going
        by the name
        'BIRDLASSER KENYA'.  No more note books and pens in the field or
        having to
        maneuver the Kenya Bird Map website to find your pentad or even
        sitting in
        front of a computer to file your records- the APP does almost
        everything for
        you.<span
style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black"> </span><o:p></o:p></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">BirdLasser will be a lot of fun for you- it
        manages 
        your LIFE-LIST and allows you to share your sightings with
        friends, clients,
        community and conservation causes. When mapping  in the field
        you do not
        need internet. Internet access is only needed when sharing  your
        records
        to the BIRD MAP- very small amount of internet.<o:p></o:p></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Download and install Birdlasser Kenya in your
        phone - it is
        available on Google Play Store for free.  However, it is only
        compatible
        with phones/tablets  that have Android Version 4.0.3 and above.
        You can
        know the android version of your phone by checking 'About
        Device' in the
        'Settings' function on your Smart Phone gadget.<o:p></o:p></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Attached below is a Quick Guide with
        instructions on how to
        install and use BirdLasser. We hope that you will enjoy using
        Birdlasser and
        find fun when mapping birds. If you have any questions, please
        send an email to
        <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:kenyabirdmap@naturekenya.org">kenyabirdmap@naturekenya.org</a>.<o:p></o:p></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Happy BirdMapping and have fun with
        Birdlasser Kenya.<o:p></o:p></p>
