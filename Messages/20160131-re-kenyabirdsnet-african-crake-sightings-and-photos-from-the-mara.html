<BR>
Brian Finch, Nigel Hunter, Jennifer Oduori and I also saw an African Crake in Nairobi National Park on 26th November, outside of the expected season.<BR>
<BR>
So evidently it a good year for African Crakes in Kenya, thanks to El Ni&ntilde;o.<BR>
<BR>
Best wishes, Fleur<BR>

Hi Nathan,<BR>
<BR>
Nice photos of the African Crake especially the one in flight. Was it raining in Mara?<BR>
<BR>
In Birds of Kenya and Northern Tanzania, it says local and uncommon intra-African migrant, mainly April-Sept. Is it possible that this species of crake can be seen early in the year like what Nathan saw in January?<BR>
<BR>

I had the privilege of birding Mara North Conservancy for a few days<BR>
last week with Ben Mugambi.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to many other nice sightings: we were treated to<BR>
surprisingly long views of an African Crake on January 20 darting in<BR>
and out of an overgrown grassy tire track, and of a January 23 bird in<BR>
flight that flushed at the approach of our vehicle.<BR>
<BR>
Photos of each are attached to this email.<BR>
<BR>
The walking bird was near Elephant Pepper Camp - just east of the<BR>
little wet area downhill in front of the camp. &nbsp;The flying bird was in<BR>
another damp tallgrass area - about 2/3 of the way between Offbeat<BR>
Mara Camp and Kicheche Mara Camp.<BR>
<BR>
We also had a couple of individuals close at hand calling back and<BR>
forth in the main reserve - while we were eating lunch near Topi<BR>
Plains.<BR>
<BR>
When Ben first spotted the walking bird in the grass, at first we<BR>
thought it might be a Corncrake - which really got my pulse rate up!<BR>
But African Crake was certainly a welcome find.<BR>
<BR>
Regards,<BR>
