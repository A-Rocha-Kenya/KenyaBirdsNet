  <pre>Dear birders,

It is very exciting that the next issue, the 10th issue, of *Kenya Birding*
has now been confirmed by Nature Kenya.

*Kenya Birding* is about birds and birding; sites and places of interest
and conservation news.  As usual I’m requesting for comments, articles, or
sightings to appear in the magazine:

• Short descriptions of sightings or other natural history observations
• Commentaries or news, in which you could draw attention to a conservation
concern or a natural history situation (between 50 and 350 words)
• Longer articles (between 350 and 700 words) or feature articles of
700-900 words

IMAGES (high resolution .tif or .jpg files)
Please avoid sending images by email.
Please send a download link via dropbox (or other cloud service) or use the
https://www.wetransfer.com/ to me at this gmail email address or to
catherine@brilliantlycrafted.com

It would greatly help if you could
(a) let me know that you are thinking of contributing and
(b) submit your contribution by *Friday 15 April*.

Also, if you have ideas for how we could make this issue even more special
please don’t hesitate to drop me a note.
