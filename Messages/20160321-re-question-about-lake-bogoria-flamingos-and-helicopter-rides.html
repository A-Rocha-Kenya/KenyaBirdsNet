  <pre>This is a shocking report, and one that should be followed up as 
quickly as possible by Kenya Wildlife Service.  There are strict 
restrictions to all aircraft concerning low flying over national 
parks and reserves.

If such flights are being operated on a regular basis then its only a 
matter of time before the flamingos will  leave the lake.  They 
simply cannot tolerate disturbance, particularly by low flying 
aircraft which sends the flocks into a state of panic and result in 
injuries to birds trying to take off en masse.

It must be hoped that Nature Kenya will take note and request KWS to 
take all appropriate action, just as they have done in the past at 
Lake Nakuru NP.
