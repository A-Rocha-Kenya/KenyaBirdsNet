  <pre>Excellent photo of the race schistacea which is common throughout the 
Persian Gulf from southern Sinai south to the Somalia and north Kenya 
coasts. Meanwhile there is also an inland population that occurs 
alongside typical Little Egrets (garzetta) along the Ethiopian Rift 
Valley lakes south to Turkana, Nakuru and Naivasha.  Dark birds are 
quite common in Ethiopia, also a few at Turkana, but this is the 
first I have heard of from Naivasha, though white phase birds have 
occurred from time to time.  Well done Sammy, and thanks for the 
great photo.
