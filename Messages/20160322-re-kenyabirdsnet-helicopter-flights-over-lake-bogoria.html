  <div dir="ltr">Thanks Dave.<div><br></div><div>That sounds good on paper but it does not seem to be sufficiently enforced in the field.  I have heard multiple stories recently, and read some online trip reports (with photos) that indicate buzzing low over Flamingo flocks is a common practice at Lake Bogoria.</div><div><br></div><div>For example:</div><div>Here is a post (with photos) in an online trip report on a Safari forum that mentions/admits to low-altitude Flamingo harassment.  The activity took place in late February - just a few weeks ago.  And in the responses to the post, another member mentions being at a camp in the Mara recently and hearing a Chinese photographer bragging about flying low over Lake Bogoria and flushing Flamingos to get good photos.  Well, he alludes to it in his public post but gave me more details in a private message.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://safaritalk.net/topic/15956-of-old-friends-and-new-kenya-revisited-february-2016/?p=191603">http://safaritalk.net/topic/15956-of-old-friends-and-new-kenya-revisited-february-2016/?p=191603</a><br></div><div><br></div><div>The irony is that the Safaritalk website forum and its members pride themselves on responsible ecotourism.  They are held in some esteem in the industry and I would like to be able to provide specific citations and references to counteract what I see as dangerous rationalizations regarding increasing helicopter harassment of Flamingos.</div><div><br></div><div>If you click through to the next page or two after the initial post above, I politely and somewhat obliquely question the ethics of the situation. In response, the person posts more photos and says &quot;There were many instances when the chopper got pretty close to a flock and the flock remained relaxed…&quot;</div><div><br></div><div>The photos and that quote seem to indicate that the 1,500 foot / 500 meter minimum height were not observed.</div><div><br></div><div>-- Someone mentioned repeated disturbance of Flamingos harming their energy budget.   I am familiar with the notion and have seen publications regarding stress / conditioning effects of repeated disturbance of shorebirds.  Does anyone know if there is literature on this regarding Greater or Lesser Flamingos?<br></div><div><br></div><div>Any detailed references or citations on the harmful effects of disturbance on Flamingos would be much appreciated.  Either in terms of conditioning or abandonment of feeding or nesting areas.</div><div><br></div><div>Given the difficulties of estimating altitude from the ground, combined with the difficulty of field enforcement of the 500 meter minimum height, it seems that KWS or another official entity should ban motorized aircraft (except in passage at high altitudes or in the process of taking off or landing at official airstrips/airports) over lakes that host significant Flamingo flocks.  Or if they are going to allow it, charge a fee to license approved helicopter operators and put that fee towards Flamingo research and conservation...</div><div><br></div><div>Good birding,</div><div><br></div><div>Nate<br><div><div class="gmail_extra"><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Mon, Mar 21, 2016 at 11:26 AM, Dave Richards <a href="mailto:onsafari@iconnect.co.ke" target="_blank">onsafari@iconnect.co.ke</a> [kenyabirdsnet] <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:kenyabirdsnet-noreply@yahoogroups.com" target="_blank">kenyabirdsnet-noreply@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left-width:1px;border-left-color:rgb(204,204,204);border-left-style:solid;padding-left:1ex">
