  <pre>Greetings birders

A visit to Lake Nakuru National Park with Jennifer Oduori and visiting Mike
Davidson showed us that the lake waters are still high and water bird
numbers are low Â­ but that Lake Nakuru is still spectacular.

Surrounded by grey lake and towering grey clouds and lit by brilliant
sunshine, Lesser and Greater flamingos and Great White Pelicans seemed
incandescent. White-winged Black Terns in full spring plumage flying between
the flooded trees and over the grey lake took my breath away.

In about four and a half hours we recorded some 85 species. Outstanding
among them were three or four African Darters, a Martial Eagle and an
Ayres&#39;s Hawk Eagle, three Red-chested Cuckoos and four Common Cuckoos
feasting on hairy caterpillars, and large flocks of White-winged Black Terns
over the old sewage pools.

At Manguo Pond in Limuru on the way back, we were surprised to find four
Garganey in breeding plumage still there. Purple Swamphens were shepherding
two fat and fuzzy juveniles.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
