Dear All,
What a wonderful day, and thankyou for being part of it, or the arrangements!
I think the total is 116, but I will soon have the report ready detailing each species by estate range, and compared to the previous two birdathons,  hmmm maybe soon is a bit of an exagerration! We&#39;ve had about fifteen species since Saturday, not recorded on that date, up in the paddock, but the Kingfisher has yet to appear!
Best for now
Brian
