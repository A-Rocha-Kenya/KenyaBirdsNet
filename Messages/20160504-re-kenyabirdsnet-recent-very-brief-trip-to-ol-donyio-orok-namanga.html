      <p>RECENT VERY BRIEF TRIP TO OL DONYIO OROK – NAMANGA.<br>
<br>
14th-16th August 2016<br>
<br>
It’s over thirty years since Leon Bennun had an expedition to look at<br>
the avifauna on Ol Donyio Orok (ODO). Fleur Ng’Weno was part of this<br>
investigation. They found some interesting records, but unfortunately<br>
I don’t have a copy of their findings. What I am aware of is that they<br>
trapped an Illadopsis which was released but sadly no photographs<br>
taken. By its distribution it was possibly the only Kenya record of<br>
the eastern form of Pale-breasted Illadopsis now considered a species<br>
apart. It appears that in spite of being an obvious isolated mountain<br>
and next to Namanga, no one had ever since visited the area and<br>
reported the birds that they found.<br>
