  <pre>Greetings birders

Nairobi National Park was alive with birds Sunday morning: flocks of swifts,
swallows and even widowbirds flycatching; Cardinal Queleas singing in the
grass; the young Grey Crowned Crane near Hyena Dam now able to fly; and at
least two pairs of African Spoonbills nesting in the Sacred Ibis colony.

KWS has done a remarkable job of draining some of the main roads so that
they are passable, but others remain a challenge to navigate.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
