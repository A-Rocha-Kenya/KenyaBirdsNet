  <pre>Dear All,
After being in Madagascar the past seven weeks, getting back on
Thursday night (29th) it was truly wonderful to be back in a country
of birds. I wasted no time in having a look in the paddock on Friday,
and also yesterday and this morning.
On Friday 30th our first ever Grey-headed Kingfisher and still there
this morning (Sunday), a Willow Warbler, an astounding male Eurasian
Golden Oriole drinking nectar from a
Grevillea robusta, my first ever Sept bird in Kenya. Eurasian
Bee-eaters in good numbers keeping high. Violet-backed Starlings
really numerous even on the ground on all three days, Saturday (1st
Oct)  two Willow Warblers (one singing), lots of Eurasian Bee-eaters
including a flock of over 35 hanging
around, this morning a getting late Mad Pond Heron still in complete
winter dress. It&#39;s so good to be back home!
For dragonfly lovers, Pantalas were already back last Friday
presumably from India
this seems really early.
Very best
Brian
