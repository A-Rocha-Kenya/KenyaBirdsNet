<blockquote type="cite" cite="">Dear&nbsp; Gladys;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So
sorry to hear of your disappointing visit to Naivasha last weekend,
but it is an all too familiar a story now.&nbsp; The effects of an
unregulated fishing industry has had a truly disastrous impact on all
water birds there, and one really wonders what the future holds for
Naivasha.</blockquote>

<blockquote type="cite" cite=""><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Our lake of international importance now faces an
uncertain future, and it could well become an environmental disaster.
Proliferating unplanned settlements and land conversions within the
Ramsar site continue to negatively impact the already fragile
ecosystem owing to the lack of development planning procedures.
Although the law is clear on many issues, an overall lack of
enforcement renders existing statutes ineffective. Without any
meaningful law enforcement, this ecosystem with its finite resources
cannot sustain for much longer the ever-increasing pressures from a
population increasing at over 3% per annum.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote type="cite" cite=""><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Given that the government has ear-marked Naivasha
District for further development, increased geothermal power and for
the establishment of several industrial estates, the question
therefore remains:&nbsp; Who in Government is willing to take
responsibility and care sufficiently to ensure a co-ordinated effort
is implemented that restores the lakes's biodiversity heritage and
provides a better environmental platform for sustaining the activities
that occur around the lake both now and in the future. Failure to do
this could result in not just continued environmental damage, but also
a sharp decline in the economic wellbeing of everyone living and
working there.</font></blockquote>
