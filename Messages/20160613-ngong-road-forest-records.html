  <pre>Greetings birders

The Purple-crested Turaco has moved from the Arboretum to Ngong Road Forest
at the Racecourse! It had not been seen at the Arborteum for some months.
Today 13 July, Nature Kenya&#39;s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk had a good view of
it feeding on a Euclea tree.

We also saw a young Crowned Eagle near its nest, and 65 other bird species,
on a cold, grey, overcast morning.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
