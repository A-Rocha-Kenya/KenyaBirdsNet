  <div dir="ltr"><div>Hi all,<br><br></div>Yesterday I was in Nairobi National Park and had some interesting eagle sightings:<br><ol><li>Â Pair of African Hawk-Eagles flying above the Mbagathi gorge close to Leopard Cliffs. They were heading southwards into the Kitengela triangle. Anyone know if they are nesting in NNP or somewhere close by?<br></li><li>Single male Bateleur flying close to Impala observation point.</li><li>Single adult Martial Eagle circling above the forest very close to the park fence at the Magadi rd/Langata rd junction. I actually spotted it from just outside Galleria shopping mall after I had left the park. It was a surprise as I do not expect to see Martial Eagle in a forested area. It was within no more than 50-100 meters of the park fence and I had no problem identifying it without binoculars. It circled about 5 times before heading back into the park. Has anyone else seen this species in this part of the park before?</li></ol><p>Best regards to all,<br></p><p>Sidney<br></p></div>
