  <pre>Hi

A photo has submitted to PHOWN (PHOtos of Weaver Nests, 
http://weavers.adu.org.za/phown.php) that may not be a weaver nest. It 
looks like a haystack in a tree and was photographed near Baringo. See 
photo and details at http://weavers.adu.org.za/phown_vm.php?vm=22062

If anyone knows what this is, please let the group/me know!

This is also a reminder to please take photos of weaver nests (also 
butterflies, frogs, spiders, etc) and submit to the Virtual Museum (see 
info below). There is a large group of taxa that you can take photos of, 
and you do not need to know the identity of the species (but do include 
the species name if you know what it is).

Dieter

To take part in the Virtual Museum, register and upload records at 
http://vmus.adu.org.za (read the &#34;How to&#34; pdf for help)
