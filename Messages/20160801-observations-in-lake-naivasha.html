  <div dir="ltr">Dear All,<div><p class="gmail-MsoNormal">Lake Naivasha was overly disappointing despite having a
joyous five hour voyage around the Lake with John Gitiri on Saturday- 30th
July-.  Not a single Teal or Whistling
Duck! We only encountered four Yellow-billed Ducks, a handful of Egyptian Goose
and less than 20 Little Grebes. There were pretty of African Fish Eagles and
one of those was about to fight with a Yellow-billed Egret, perhaps for a fish,
but flew away once we approached.</p>

<p class="gmail-MsoNormal">The Great White and Yellow-billed Egrets were relatively
many on the floating emergent vegetation. We also had a nice time of the day with
Squacco Herons and a fantastic view of a Little Bittern. Grey-headed Herons
were also common but I remember counting only one Black-headed Heron, which was
in fact on flight. There was also a couple of isolated groups  of Great White Pelicans- containing less than
five individuals.</p>

<p class="gmail-MsoNormal">Cormorants never disappoint in Lake Naivasha, both Great and
Reed- they were very many.</p>

<p class="gmail-MsoNormal">The Crescent Island was colorful with close to fifty
perching Grey-headed Gulls,  assorted Egrets
and Grey-headed Heron. </p><p class="gmail-MsoNormal">My biggest disappointment was the many fishing nets around
the Lake with white reflectors which one would mistake for floating Gulls at a
distance. The fishing nets have some obvious effect on the presence and
population of ducks especially the diving ones. Disturbances from engine boats-
very common at the lake- is another worrying factor for the waterbirds.<br></p><p class="gmail-MsoNormal">Happy birding,</p><p class="gmail-MsoNormal">Gladys Kung&#39;u</p><div><br></div><div><br></div></div></div>
