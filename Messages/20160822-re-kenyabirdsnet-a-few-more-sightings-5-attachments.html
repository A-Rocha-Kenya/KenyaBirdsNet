<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1f497d">A week ago while on a non-birding tour I could not stop enjoying
close up looks of very tame Shallow’s Wheatears at the new Lake Nakuru Sopa
Lodge while a near tree (50m away) had one single Hemprich’s Hornbill calling
and who stayed around for all the lunch hour while there. I have seen them a couple
of times in the park before and frequented them Menengai Crater whenever i went
birding there and as well as Railway Station in Nakuru once. Also very close was
a “Blue-spotted Wood-Dove” as to how i ID’ed it feeding together with an
Emerald Spotted Wood Dove. Never seen them before in  Lake Nakuru NP..... I did
not want to follow the bird for a better photo as it wasn’t on visitors
interest but I managed one attached. However, same day I found 1 more Blue
Spotted WDs and I was worried that may be  I have been overlooking at them
before and just calling them ESWD since that’s what i expected. However, later
but same day i thought if i remember BSWD have yellowgreen bill tip but this
two individual had red-tipped bills. I therefore hoped to find another  individual
but never came across. Now I’m totally confused if this is BSWD or ESWD and if a
south-of-equator Emerald SWD with red bill would look like and I cannot find
any photo of ESWD with red bill that I ever took. The bill tip of this is red
to about half the bill length would appreciate a help on this or what the story
is<u></u><u></u></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1f497d">In June while with Tris Allinson from Birdlife International we
had a single male African Crake in Nairobi N Park. Some roads were dry but
there still quite lots of slow running water through the grassland where the
bird disappeared too. We never got a photo unfortunately. Same June, Ethiopian
Swallows were feeding two youngones along the Solio fences along the 32km rd
north of Solio. While the first bridge had 2 nests of Angolan Swallows and were
feeding babies. Before this sighting, the eastern most range for the birds i knew
only ones nesting at Keekorok bridge in Masai Mara. And i have read of the ones
nesting in school at OlBorosat.<u></u><u></u></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1f497d">Then about two weeks ago still in Lake Nakuru National Park and
still on a non-birding trip I came across these weaver that looked “icecream”
yellow (attached). Looks like leucism but does it come this yellow. <u></u><u></u></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1f497d">Same Nakuru had this female Cliffchat (attached) whose mantle
feathers were fluffed over the wing as i’d thought. But she flew out and back
the feather seemed unchanged <u></u><u></u></span></p>
