  <p><span>Hi Birders please advice on how to handle the Sacred ibis when they become distractive to the grounds as impact of population increase. Windsor has been a breeding ground for number of birds species, in years. The challenge has been abnormal behavior from the Sacred Ibis nesting at one of the dam they have over stayed to the island and the site has been degraded same as the show of the island is been eroded by the adult and young ones. The previous years they stay for three month and leave but this time around they have stayed for five month, bring in some hazard to the areas and even to golf greens.</span></p><p><span>Your advice will be welcome and considered for conservation concept</span></p><p>Great birding</p><p>Jonathan&nbsp;</p>
