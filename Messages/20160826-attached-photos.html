  <div dir="ltr">Dear All,<div><br></div><div>A fellow KWS Hon.Warden spotted the photo of this man by the name Kalama Kenya handling owls, in a facebook group. Some one must have started asking questions because picture has been removed. </div><div>Does anyone from the Arabuko Sokoke Forest/Gede/Watamu area know this man &amp; maybe shed some more light on what is happening in this picture? According to KK&#39;s facebook page he hails from Gede! </div><div>I will be at Arabuko Sokoke this Saturday &amp; most probably also get a chance to talk to Stanley Baya from Arocha &amp; KFS! </div><div>Am very concerned about what might have happended to these owls! </div><div><br></div><div>Best regards</div><div>Doris V. Schaule </div></div>
