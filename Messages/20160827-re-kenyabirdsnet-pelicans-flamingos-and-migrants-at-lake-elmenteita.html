&nbsp;Indeed as Fleur has mentioned the Sunday bird watch was a delight despite a few incidents on the road. Many thanks to Serena Camp for the invite. I took a few shots during the trip. I have attached them herein with their names. Now, I am relatively new to birding and the field guide am using is quite shallow. Hence, if some of the birds are wrongly identified, I welcome the corrections. Pleasant birding all.<BR>
<BR>
Kind regards,<BR>
<BR>

Greetings birders<BR>
<BR>
Nature Kenya's Sunday Birdwatch spent some delightful hours on the shores of<BR>
Lake Elmenteita, by kind invitation of Lake Elmenteita Serena Camp. It was<BR>
at midday because on the heavy traffic to and from Nairobi, but the lake was<BR>
beautiful and the birds abundant.<BR>
<BR>
Great White Pelicans are nesting on the islands in the lake. The pelicans<BR>
presumably brought in fish from Lake Nakuru, so we saw many rafts of white<BR>
pelicans fishing cooperatively. I guesstimate that there were about a<BR>
thousand Lesser Flamingo on the western tip of the lake, and some 400<BR>
Greater Flamingo.<BR>
<BR>
Migrants who had arrived included Common Greenshank, Wood Sandpiper, Common<BR>
Sandpiper, Little Stint, Ruff, Gull-billed Tern and White-winged Black Tern.<BR>
<BR>
Other notable birds were about 100 Cape Teal; and Black Cuckoo, Red-chested<BR>
Cuckoo and Broad-billed Roller.<BR>
<BR>
Wishing you good birding, Fleur<BR>
