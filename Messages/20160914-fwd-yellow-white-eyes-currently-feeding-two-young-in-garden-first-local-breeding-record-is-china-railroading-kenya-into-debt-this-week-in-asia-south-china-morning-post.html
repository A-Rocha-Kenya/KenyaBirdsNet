Dear All
As Kenyans we should be afraid, very afraid. Interesting article
detailing insidious Chinese tentacles strangling the Kenya Government.
Very interesting that the price of the railway line is three times
what it should be, where is that going I wonder?

A pair of Yellow White-eyes are currently feeding two young here in
the garden. This would constitute the first breeding of the species in
Nairobi County.

Best to all
Brian
