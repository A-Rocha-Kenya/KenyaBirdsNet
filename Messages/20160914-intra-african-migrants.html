  <pre>Greetings birders

Nature Kenya&#39;s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk met at Uhuru Gardens National
Monument today. Birding was good as usual, with some intra-African migrants:
Grey-headed Kingfisher and Black Cuckooshrike, the male cuckooshrike with
brilliant yellow shoulders.

There was confusion followed by delight as we alternately sighted a Gabar
Goshawk, then a Lizard Buzzard, and then the Gabar Goshawk again.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
