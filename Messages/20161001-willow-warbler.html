  <pre>My first Willow Warbler of the season!

On October first at the birdbath in my Nairobi garden.

In other records, on September 18 Nature Kenya&#39;s Sunday Birdwatch visited
Kinale Forest off the Nairobi-Naivasha Road. It was an area of indigenous
forest that had been logged in the past, with a few large gnarled trees
remaining and many young Neoboutonia trees, and some cypress plantations.
There we found brilliantly coloured birds: Red-fronted Parrot, Doherty&#39;s
Bushshrike and Black-headed Waxbill (now called Kandt&#39;s Waxbill).

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
