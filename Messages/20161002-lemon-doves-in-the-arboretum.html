  <div dir="ltr">Dear all,<br><br>I could not believe my eyes today when I spotted a pair of Lemon Doves in the Nairobi Arboretum. They were EXTREMELY shy and I had to follow them meticulously for nearly 20 minutes, pretty much crawling through dense undergrowth, just to get a proper look for confirmation of species ID! Sadly I didn&#39;t manage to get any photos as they simply were too shy to give me a chance of doing so.Â <br><br>I initially spotted them at the edge of the walking trail and thought they were red-eyed doves but quickly realized they were different as they resorted to walking into the undergrowth rather than taking off as I approached. Plus their color and size also seemed a bit off for red-eyed. One eventually paused just long enough for me to see the white face and greenish iridescence at the back of the neck. Has anyone ever seen them at the Arboretum before? I never expected to see them in such a disturbed forest.<br><br>Regards,<br>Sidney</div>
