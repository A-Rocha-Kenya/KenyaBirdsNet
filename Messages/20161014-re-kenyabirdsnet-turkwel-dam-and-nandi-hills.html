    <p>Hi Kieran,</p>
    <p>Some great birding you've been having! And will look forward to
      seeing the data on the Kenya Bird Map - thanks in advance for
      that. Not sure if you've been aware but we recently hit 10%
      coverage of the country and 100,000 records. The potential is huge
      for the sorts of information and value we'll be able to get out of
      the atlas for conservation and just general birding as well. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Have you tried out the BirdLasser app yet? It is superb for
      making it easy to know which pentad you're in and is extremely
      easy for logging birds - and it does all the calculations of time
      in a pentad etc for you. It has been around for a year or more for
      Android phones but there is now the iPhone version that is being
      tested. If you use iPhone, it would be great if you would like to
      try it out and give feed back to BirdLasser who are keen for input
      on how to improve it. Drop an email to
      <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:kenyabirdmap@naturekenya.org">kenyabirdmap@naturekenya.org</a> to ask for the beta version for
      iPhone.<br>
    </p>
    <p>thanks again and hope you get some more good birding in!<br>
    </p>
    <p>Best,</p>
    <p>Colin<br>

            <p><span style="word-spacing:normal;">Dad, mum and I spent a
                week in the north rift and in particular at Turkwel dam.
                We were given permission to put a boat on the dam and so
                had full access which was amazing. The dam is a
                beautiful spot and covers a huge area although it is
                very low at the moment. Wildlife was scarce - baboons,
                vervet and dikdik</span><span
                style="word-spacing:normal;"> were seen and I heard a
                leopard on two occasions. One really noticeable thing is
                the number of rock hyrax around the lake - thousands and
                thousands! I have a theory that as the lake is still
                relatively new - 27 years old - the displacement of
                hyrax the flooding caused pushed them to the edges and
                so a population boom has occurred, waiting for a disease
                outbreak to occur as predators are few and far
                between... Any thoughts?</span></p>
            <p><span style="word-spacing:normal;"><br>
              </span></p>
            <p>The dry-country birdlife was as good as ever but bird
              life on the dam was actually limited, I think this is
              mainly because there isn't a reed habitat as the dam level
              fluctuates so much that reeds either flood or dry
              depending on the rapid changes in level. White winged and
              whiskered terns were numerous as were yellow billed
              storks, fish eagles and giant kingfishers. Ospreys were
              seen - 6 individuals on the dam I would estimate.
              Interestingly one species that was everywhere, day and
              night, was black crowned night herons - in very large
              numbers. Green backed-herons were also numerous. Waders
              were limited to common greenshanks and three banded
              plovers - that was all which was strange - again maybe a
              lack of mud flat/reed habitat?</p>
            <p>Long-tailed and great cormorants, darters and pink-backed
              pelicans were thriving. One little grebe seen. Grey and
              black headed herons, hammerkop's, african spoonbills and
              pied kingfishers present. Little and intermediate egrets
              are doing well.</p>
            <p><br>
            </p>
            <p>I saw one Abdims stork which looked really out of place
              amongst the yellow billed storks. But the best sighting
              for the area was a <span style="font-weight:bold;">stripe-breasted
                seed eater</span> - my first siting and really exciting
              to see despite just being a LBJ! Another noticeable and
              beautiful species was large numbers of bristle crowned
              starlings which were actually quite tame for once. Birds
              of prey were few and far between - Augur buzzard, Verraux
              eagles (happy with all the hyrax I'm sure!), Shikra, Gabar
              goshawk, E. pale chanting goshawk, pygmy falcon. Spotted
              eagle owls were really vocal. Also managed to spot the
              elusive stone partridge... Always a pleasure.</p>
            <p><br>
            </p>
            <p>There is a very healthy population of crocodiles on the
              lake which was great too see despite lots of fishermen's
              nets - and they weren't shy so hopefully they aren't being
              persecuted too badly. Lots of tilapia, catfish and some
              barbel. It's an interesting dam but birdlife wasn't as
              good as I had expected. The fluctuating levels may be a
              factor but maybe also because it is still a relatively new
              dam. I wonder if the migrants have discovered it properly
              yet? Lots to research there I feel and it would be
              interesting to visit in the middle of the northern winter
              and see what migrants are there.</p>
            <p><br>
            </p>
            <p>I have been in Nandi for a while where the birdlife is
              also brilliant. One strange thing I have noticed in the
              garden where I am staying, which I am struggling to
              explain, is that <span style="font-weight:bold;">all </span>of
              the pied wagtails have clubbed feet - most of them just
              one but some both feet. They literally have just a stump
              at the level of the distal tarsus. Amazingly they are
              coping fine but do look a bit scruffy. It's just the local
              population though as 20 minutes away they are fine. My
              thoughts are: genetic trait, burnt from coals/kuni
              booster, fungal/bacterial infection, trapping, siafu ant
              damage, something to do with pesticide/fertiliser sprayed
              on crops... Has anyone seen this before and know why? They
              have evaded a photo so far but I will keep trying.</p>
            <p><br>
            </p>
            <p>Leaf loves and double toothed barbets are regular. <span
                style="word-spacing:normal;">Scaley-throated honeyguides
                in Koru impossible to see until I played them the call
                on the E. African birds app which attracted them
                instantly.</span><span style="word-spacing:normal;"> A
                white spotted fluff tail called in by whistling back to
                it was the birding highlight. The most special siting so
                far though was three clawless otters in one of the dams
                - I had never seen them before despite so much looking
                so that made my day!</span></p>
            <p><br>
            </p>
            <p>Migrants seen = barn swallows, willow warblers,
              white-throated and Eurasian bee-eaters. Not many though.</p>
            <p><br>
            </p>
            <p>I will get round to filling the bird map pentads as soon
              as possible.</p>
            <p><br>
