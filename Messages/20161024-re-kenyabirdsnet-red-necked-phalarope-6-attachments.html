  <pre>Really nice James,
Thankyou for reporting this. Red-necked Phalaropes have black
needle-thin bills, Grey have stouter bills with yellow on them, so
this is a very nice Red-necked,
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Was at Nakuru National Park this weekend and amongst a group of Cape Teal
&gt; was the attached which I assume is a red-necked Phalarope (non-breeding
&gt; plumage and probably immature).  Just wanted to make certain because other
&gt; than the Birds of East Africa, no other major authority recognises Africa as
&gt; a wintering/resident location for this bird.  Handbook of birds of the world
&gt; has eighty sightings none of which occur in Africa.
