  <p><span>Birders,</span></p><p><span><br>Was at Nakuru National Park this weekend and amongst a group of Cape Teal was the attached which I assume is a red-necked Phalarope (non-breeding plumage and probably immature). &nbsp;Just wanted to make certain because other than the Birds of East Africa, no other major authority recognises Africa as a wintering/resident location for this bird. &nbsp;Handbook of birds of the world has eighty sightings none of which occur in Africa.</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>Best Regards,</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>James</span></p>
