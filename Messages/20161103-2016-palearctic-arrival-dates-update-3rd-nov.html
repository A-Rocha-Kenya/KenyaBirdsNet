  <pre>Dear All,
A new migrant first date update is attached.

News from our paddock. A final species on 1st Nov, of which I am sure
warrants as palearctic migrants at 7.20pm, the Black-winged Stilts
flew over for the first time this passage, last year they were present
from 12th October onwards.

Nov 2nd was a cold miserable morning, much cloud but still no rain.
Migrants seen were a single Eurasian Hobby flying S quite high, a
heavy passage of Common Swifts all moving E towards NNP, several
parties of Eurasian Bee-eaters but no evidence of movement, two
Eurasian Rollers also going E, a few Barn Swallows mainly S, a single
House Martin NE, up to fifteen Willow Warblers, a female Blackcap and
two Spotted Flycatchers, with the Black-winged Stilts again after
dark.

Today 3rd Nov, warmer than yesterday but quite a cloudy start and
still no rain. Migrants in the morning were a single Common Swift E, a
few Eurasian Bee-eaters, two Eurasian Golden Orioles heading E, a few
Barn Swallows in all directions, two House Martins NE, a Sand Martin
N, about ten Willow Warblers, the first male Blackcap of the season
and two Garden Warblers, the same two Spotted Flycatchers (present
last five days), two Tree Pipits were the first since the first on
23rd Oct. Also several of what were almost certainly Yellow Wagtails
flying E down the Mbagathi Valley but just too far to be positive.
At 3.30pm three Black Storks came in low over the garden from the W
following the Mbagathi Valley and disappeared into NNP. Shortly
followed by the Bat Hawk who was lesurely flying very low towards
IUCN.

If you have any August-September dates for Eurasian Bee-eater,
Northern Wheatear and Barn Swallow (the last away from the Rift as
some birds over summer), it would be appreciated.

Best for now
Brian
