  <pre>Thanks James,
The first was a really early bird in NNP 9th Oct, and I have had two
here. The only warblers so far have been Willow, Garden, Blackcap,
Whitethroat and our Olive Tree, so plenty more warblers yet!
Best
for now
Brian

&gt; Hi Brian and All, not sure if Greater Whitethroat has been reported yet
&gt; this autumn but Simon Carter and I found a single bird in Lower Kabete
&gt; today. Also a Red-tailed Shrike showing nice contrast between rufous crown
&gt; and pale sandy mantle.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, James

&gt;&gt; Dear All,
&gt;&gt; Continuing the migrant watch report, this morning (4th) was gloomy and
&gt;&gt; still no rain. It was also cool and birds were not eager to move much.
&gt;&gt; There was a small passage of Common Swifts but White-rumped are
&gt;&gt; actually increasing and hanging around old nest sites, a dozen
&gt;&gt; Eurasian Bee-eaters were in the area, a Eurasian Golden Oriole was
&gt;&gt; heading south, a House Martin going north, eight or so Willow Warblers
&gt;&gt; and two Blackcaps (both males). The only other migrant was a Spotted
&gt;&gt; Flycatcher.
&gt;&gt; At 9.30am James Bradley came around and we returned to the paddock. He
&gt;&gt; came at the right time as a Long-legged Buzzard was heading south
&gt;&gt; directly overhead but apart from unseen calling Yellow Wagtails there
&gt;&gt; were no other migrant additions.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; We then went down to the Icross Road (Elangata Wuas Rd) just a little
&gt;&gt; way down the Magadi Road and spent the rest of the day in that area.
&gt;&gt; Migrants were a group of seven Common Buzzards coming in to find a
&gt;&gt; roosting place, a hepatic Eurasian Cuckoo, a dozen Eurasian Bee-eaters
&gt;&gt; along the wires, a Red-tailed Shrike sp (only seen in flight so not
&gt;&gt; identified), a male Red-backed Shrike, a scattering of Barn Swallows
&gt;&gt; but no major passage, the only migrant warbler seen there was a
&gt;&gt; stunning Olive Tree that initially stayed in the depths of an Acacia
&gt;&gt; mellifera, but eventually gave itself up and provided excellent open
&gt;&gt; views, four Eurasian Rock Thrush, over a dozen Northern and three Pied
&gt;&gt; Wheatears and four Spotted Flycatchers.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The 5th was quite gloomy and cool when I took my position in the
&gt;&gt; paddock shortly after 6.00am. It would be true to say that all day
&gt;&gt; there was not one instance of any positive visual migration and the
&gt;&gt; following species were probably all birds that arrived previously. The
&gt;&gt; migrant raptors were just soaring around low over the trees rather
&gt;&gt; than making a direct passage overhead. In the morning there was a
&gt;&gt; Black Stork with undercarriage down for a landing into NNP, the
&gt;&gt; peculiar sight of eight Ruff heading for NNP, a female-plumaged
&gt;&gt; Montaguâ€™s/Pallid Harrier more likely the former on structure, a few
&gt;&gt; Common Swifts and Barn Swallows, a few Eurasian Bee-eaters, eight
&gt;&gt; Willow Warblers, two Blackcaps and a Garden Warbler and the usual two
&gt;&gt; Spotted Flycatchers plus three Tree Pipits and additionally in the
&gt;&gt; afternoon two Common Buzzards both pale and one with a very rusty
&gt;&gt; tail, a pale Booted Eagle, two Eurasian Hobbys and a Eurasian Golden
&gt;&gt; Oriole.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Another strange sight mid-morning was a heron that arrived from the
&gt;&gt; west, that dropped from a great height then circled over the garden
&gt;&gt; flapping all the time, no heron can soar they all have to flap to stay
&gt;&gt; airborne but can glide with wings bowed downwards when losing
&gt;&gt; altitude, this is strange because they have such a large wing area.
&gt;&gt; Storks that are similarly built are able to soar for long periods. The
&gt;&gt; bird was an immature Purple Heron, possibly this was a palearctic
&gt;&gt; arrival some should be crossing the sahara. As with most birds it flew
&gt;&gt; off low towards NNP.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Morning of 6th was clammy chilly and overcast but soon brightened up,
&gt;&gt; but accompanied with a gusty wind. There was some movement at 6.45am
&gt;&gt; when parties of Swifts came over quite low. They were in groups of up
&gt;&gt; to fifty flying completely direct, and whilst in dense rotund clusters
&gt;&gt; each individual skilfully maintained the same distance from all its
&gt;&gt; neighbours. There were two species involved, the grating screams
&gt;&gt; easily identified African Black from all other larger swifts, but the
&gt;&gt; second species was silent, and were all of the entire flock and were
&gt;&gt; of the returning Pallid-like birds for this season. They were not much
&gt;&gt; above eye-level and all uniform buff-grey above. One day the species
&gt;&gt; will make the Kenya list!
&gt;&gt; Three Tree Pipits circling, four House Martins heading NW and a single
&gt;&gt; Barn Swallow heading to NNP were the only moving palearctics apart
&gt;&gt; from the swifts. Whilst in the bushes were a few Willow Warblers and
&gt;&gt; the currently resident Spotted Flycatcher.
&gt;&gt; After returning from breakfast for a short while it was still quite
&gt;&gt; quiet, a Green Sandpiper flew over towards NNP, a fairly dark Common
&gt;&gt; Buzzard and a pale Booted Eagle were patrolling the valley, there were
&gt;&gt; a few more Barn Swallows and just before dusk the days only Eurasian
&gt;&gt; Hobby.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Best to all
&gt;&gt; Brian
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;
