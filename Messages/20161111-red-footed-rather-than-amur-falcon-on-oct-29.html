  <pre>Greetings birders

An immature falcon with red feet perched in my Nairobi garden on Oct 29, and
I reported it as an Amur Falcon. Now Brian Finch tells me that they do not
arrive until late November, and it was probably a Red-footed Falcon!

Quite thrilling, as well as the nightingales from October 31, and the
Thrush-nightingales in Uhuru Gardens on November 5.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
