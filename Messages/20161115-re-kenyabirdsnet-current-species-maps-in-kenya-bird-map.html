    </p><p>The Kenya Bird Map has been running now for about two years and
      as many will know we have hit the 10% coverage of Kenya mark a
      couple of months ago and also 100,000 records. These have all been
      contributed by just 182 observers in all with just over 100 taking
      part in 2016 so far contributing over 1,000 full protocol cards
      this year alone. <br>
    </p>
    <p>This is an awesome effort and as a result we are now at the stage
      where current species maps are starting to come together and make
      sense. As a result we have now just had a &#39;<font color="#990000"><b>Species
          summaries</b>&#39;</font> option added to the main menu on the <a href="http://kenyabirdmap.adu.org.za/index.php" target="_blank">Kenya Bird Map
        website</a>:</p>
    <p><img src="cid:part2.D8957E53.367DA779@arocha.org" alt="" height="338" width="909"></p>
    <p>Click on that and it will open a list of all the species for
      Kenya grouped alphabetically to aid in searching for the one you
      want. If you click on a letter beside the &quot;Search by letter&quot;
      option, this will select all species whose common name and family
      name start with that letter. E.g. click on &#39;N&#39; and you will get
      &#39;Northern Red Bishop&#39; as well as &#39;Brown Noddy&#39;. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Click on a species and it will open a new window showing the map
      of Kenya with all accepted records showing - with reporting rate
      colour coded for each pentad where the species has been reported
      on a Full Protocol card. If you zoom out on the map, you will then
      be able to see all the records for that species that have been
      submitted anywhere in Africa (currently basically southern Africa
      though Nigeria has done quite a lot but just not vetted records
      yet and so they are not visible).<br>
    </p>
    <p>To add records from &#39;Ad hoc&#39; cards, click on the central icon
      under &#39;Tools&#39;: <br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="cid:part3.36A4A344.69BAC862@arocha.org" alt=""></p>
    <p>The Right had icon will add the Incidental records - though
      vetting of these has not been done as much as the Full Protocol
      and ad hoc submissions and so fewer are shown. <br>
    </p>
    <p>There are still a lot of gaps, of course, and there is a big need
      for some catch up on the vetting as there are many outstanding
      records that have been submitted that need vetting - something
      which we will be focussing on doing over the next few months.
      There is also clearly a need for more observers and contributors -
      so if you&#39;ve not yet taken part or have done one or two cards, <b>please
        do join us</b> in contributing to building up a picture of the
      status of Kenya&#39;s birds. Following the protocol is highly
      enjoyable (actually, it gets quite addictive) and is contributing
      to what will become the baseline for our understanding of the
      status and conservation of Kenya&#39;s birds.</p>
    <p>The BirdLasser smart phone app has made atlassing incredibly easy
      and enjoyable and is now available for iPhone as well as Android
      phones (the iPhone version is still being finally tested before
      public release but a link to the beta version can be obtained if
      you write to the Kenya Bird Map office:
      <a class="m_-1166844655209599884moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:kenyabirdmap@naturekenya.org" target="_blank">kenyabirdmap@naturekenya.org</a>). Furthermore a lot of new features
      have been added to the app including the ability to record a voice
      message (or a bird sound!) for any specific record (simply press
      and hold the &#39;log&#39; button for a couple of seconds to activate it).
      Try it out.</p>
    <p>There has been some discussion on the arrival dates of Palearctic
      migrants. While currently a summary option for this is not yet
      available directly on the website, of course the <i>data</i> are
      all there in the database and can readily be extracted. An
      overhaul of the inner workings of the website(s) (including <a href="http://sabap2.adu.org.za/index.php" target="_blank">SABAP2 </a>and <a href="http://nigeriabirdatlas.adu.org.za/index.php" target="_blank">Nigeria Bird
        Atlas</a>) is currently underway but plans are there to add
      summaries such as first and last dates and a number of others so
      as to make the data available for anyone interested in using them.
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>More updates in due course... - but please do either join the
      Kenya Bird Map team or recommend any visiting birders to sign up
      and contribute.<br>
