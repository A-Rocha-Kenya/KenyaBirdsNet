    <p>Dear Brian &amp; All,</p>
    <p>Really interesting to see these first returning migrant dates. I
      know this used to be published in Scopus some years back so there
      should be a record of this for comparison.</p>
    <p>The other thing, of course, is that the<a
        href="http://kenyabirdmap.adu.org.za/"> bird atlas (Kenya Bird
        Map)</a> is perfectly designed to capture exactly this sort of
      information. In fact if enough birders are contributing across the
      country frequently enough, you can track the arrival of migrants
      down through the country (at least this has been done in South
      Africa for common / obvious migrants like Barn Swallow). The
      beauty of the atlas is also that you can then get annual
      comparisons very easily - and not just that but also get the
      average arrival date or the date that a given species becomes
      commonly seen which is biologically more important than the very
      first arrival. <br>
    </p>
    <p>I've discussed with the database manager about this and once the
      new website for the atlas is up (expected mid-2017), it will be
      possible to add any queries observers / users might need such as
      to give the first and last dates for migrants. <br>
    </p>
    <p>But for any of this to be possible the only way is to have the
      data in the atlas through as many people contributing as possible.
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>We've now reached 2,500 full protocol cards submitted and over
      108,000 records from 763 pentads (atlas squares) and the potential
      is there to really start to use this information.<br>
    </p>
    <p>For anyone interested, The BirdLasser app is now available for
      iPhone (a beta version, I believe) as well as Android phones and
      it can be used to record a wide range of additional information
      for any record including breeding activity, age, sex, number of
      individuals, interactions etc. Please just remember to switch
      'atlassing' on under the settings!</p>
    <p>Best,</p>
    <p>Colin<br>

            <p>Dear All,<br>
              Attached is an update of the First Dates as at the 15th
              November 2016.<br>
              <br>
              The 12th, usual cold and cloudy start with intermittent
              sun in morning<br>
              and more in afternoon. No hint of rain.<br>
              Probably all of the palearctics today are at least
              temporary residents<br>
              in the area. The distinctive rufous Common Buzzard was
              patrolling the<br>
              local gardens in the afternoon, four Common Swift moved E
              in the early<br>
              morning, just three Eurasian Bee-eaters were feeding
              overhead, only<br>
              the occasional Barn Swallows flying in random directions,
              for the<br>
              first time since September there are no Willow Warblers,
              but there<br>
              were three Blackcap, one Common Nightingale gave excellent
              views as it<br>
              fed in short grass under the hedge, and there were three
              Tree Pipits<br>
              in the area.<br>
              <br>
              Amongst the Afrotropical movers, the Grey Crowned Cranes
              reached a new<br>
              high of nine in a flock and again headed W along the
              valley towards<br>
              the Rift, and a Bat Hawk made a brief appearance.<br>
              <br>
              The morning of the 13th showed no change in the weather
              cold, grey and<br>
              no rain. Again brightening from quite early in the morning
              for a<br>
              mainly sunny afternoon.<br>
              <br>
              At dusk a female-type Pallid Harrier came into the paddock
              but did not<br>
              stop, possibly the same bird as two days ago, the rufous
              Common<br>
              Buzzard was in residence. Two Aquila eagles flew W down
              the valley in<br>
              the afternoon, they appeared very dark both above and
              below and<br>
              short-winged. They were probably both adult Lesser Spotted
              Eagles but<br>
              a bit too far to be really certain. They were not Steppe
              Eagles<br>
              however. In the late afternoon a Eurasian Hobby going west
              was shortly<br>
              followed by an adult Sooty Falcon. A single female-type
              Eurasian<br>
              Golden Oriole flew low E across the garden in the
              afternoon, possibly<br>
              a few more Barn Swallows than lately, four Blackcaps were
              sitting on<br>
              the same branch in a lantana, and a Garden Warbler was
              eating Grewia<br>
              similis fruit. A Great Sparrowhawk flushed the only Willow
              Warbler of<br>
              the day, which needn’t have worried as they are not
              exactly a full<br>
              meal, but it probably did not know this and wasn’t
              prepared to take a<br>
              chance! Yesterday’s Nightingale was still around and some
              three Tree<br>
              Pipit were in the area, and for the first time since
              September, no<br>
              Eurasian Bee-eaters!<br>
              <br>
              For the Afrotropical wanderers, a new single flock high of
              over<br>
              twenty-five Long-tailed Cormorants flew E along the
              valley, but only<br>
              two Grey-crowned Cranes followed the same direction in the
              evening, as<br>
              did only the fourth Black-shouldered Kite for the place.
              It was a good<br>
              day for raptors with the usual resident adult Martial
              Eagle over IUCN,<br>
              and an adult Ayre’s Hawk-Eagle hunting over the valley.
              Eight<br>
              Grey-headed Silverbills came over low but continued E
              towards NNP,<br>
              they were the first here for the recording period but we
              have had them<br>
              in the past.<br>
              <br>
              No change in the weather on the 14th, but apparently
              Kibwezi had heavy<br>
              rain last night and there are quite a lot of billowing
              clouds here<br>
              today.<br>
              One Eurasian Hobby flew W along the valley in the early
              morning, there<br>
              were seven Eurasian Bee-eaters flying around, in the early
              morning one<br>
              Eurasian Golden Oriole flew high E down the valley,
              another slight<br>
              increase in Barn swallows, just one each of Willow Warbler
              and<br>
              Blackcap, a Nightingale pinking from cover in the IUCN
              eastern<br>
              boundary, and again about three Tree Pipits in the area.
              On the<br>
              afternoon watch a Black Stork landed in a tree along the
              Mbagathi, the<br>
              rufous Common Buzzard was patrolling the area, the
              Nightingale was<br>
              feeding along the edge of the western fence where it had
              been the<br>
              previous two mornings, and how it did it I have no idea
              but a silent<br>
              Tree Pipit appeared ten feet in front of me and stayed for
              the rest of<br>
              the afternoon feeding around me, silently. There is a lot
              of evidence<br>
              of “the usual suspects.”<br>
              <br>
              Eight Grey Crowned Cranes flew W to roost, it must be
              fairly close to<br>
              here and for the first time since March, the Bat Hawks
              appeared as a<br>
              pair and were displaying for nearly twenty minutes right
              over the<br>
              paddock and the house. A single African Black Swift came
              over very<br>
              low, Red-billed Queleas seem to be flying over with more
              frequency.<br>
              <br>
              On the depressing morning of 15th, I was sitting up in our
              paddock, it<br>
              was cold (and still is) overcast and blustery, all the
              right moves for<br>
              rain but none was appearing. I was sitting in a chair
              recording the<br>
              visual migration. Our Bat Hawk appeared without his mate
              at 6.40am,<br>
              and did a few circuits. Ten minutes later he flew across
              the garden<br>
              with a rather large forked stick in his claws. Twenty
              minutes later he<br>
              came back from where he had flown to and did more
              circuits, then<br>
              started madly diving amongst the bushes and trees within
              feet of the<br>
              ground wheeling and swerving for about five minutes, round
              and round<br>
              and passing within fifteen feet of me on the passes. The
              female never<br>
              appeared and all this was pure exuberance, he was having
              fun, not<br>
              hunting or displaying. A Bat Hawk can brighten up the most
              unpleasant<br>
              of mornings!<br>
              <br>
              The palearctic story today, the Black Stork came in to
              roost at<br>
              6.15pm, but the rufous Common Buzzard was early and up
              before 7.00am<br>
              patrolling the gardens. A Peregrine spent fifteen minutes
              perched on a<br>
              tower, but was small and crisp black/white and was
              certainly the<br>
              resident race minor and not a large palearctic bird
              calidus. Two<br>
              Eurasian Hobbies flew strongly S after the light showers
              this evening,<br>
              and a Common Cuckoo came in at tree-top level heading N,
              so was<br>
              unlikely to be a new arrival. In the morning several
              compact flocks of<br>
              over 150 “Pallid” Swifts were flying over low, and after
              the afternoon<br>
              showers there were a few feeding over the Mbagathi Valley.
              After an<br>
              absence all day, over thirty Eurasian Bee-eaters flew over
              as a flock<br>
              heading for a roost in the evening. Two Eurasian Golden
              Orioles were<br>
              flying high E in the morning, just two Barn Swallows,
              whilst actually<br>
              in the garden just three Willow Warblers, single Blackcap
              and Common<br>
              Nightingale and two Tree Pipits.<br>
              <br>
              It was possible that as far as the Afrotropicals were
              concerned water<br>
              birds might have been moving locally. Recorded were four
              Black-headed<br>
              and one Grey Heron, two separate African Spoonbills and
              ten<br>
              Yellow-billed Storks. It is time for the Lesser Striped
              Swallows to<br>
              return to Nairobi, and with the showers and the heavy
              rains to the<br>
              east it is likely the birds will suddenly appear but we
              don’t know if<br>
              it is en masse or gradual. It would be interesting if
              people could<br>
              record the first birds that the see back in Nairobi, as we
              know<br>
              nothing of this annual absence August-mid November, but
              they certainly<br>
              all go somewhere else.<br>
              <br>
              Just for the record, the following first common to regular
              palearctics<br>
              are still unreported…. Northern Pintail, Common Kestrel,
              Lesser<br>
              Kestrel, Amur Falcon, Eleonora’s Falcon, Eurasian
              Honey-Buzzard,<br>
              Eurasian Sparrowhawk, Corncrake, Pacific Golden Plover,
              Little Ringed<br>
              Plover, Great Snipe, Spotted Redshank, Sanderling,
              Temminck’s Stint,<br>
              Broad-billed Sandpiper, Black-headed Gull, Slender-billed
              Gull, Lesser<br>
              Cuckoo, Blue-cheeked Bee-eater, Eurasian Hoopoe, Lesser
              Grey Shrike,<br>
              River Warbler, Basra Reed Warbler, Great Reed Warbler,
              Sedge Warbler,<br>
              Eurasian Reed Warbler, Marsh Warbler, Upcher’s Warbler,
              Icterine<br>
              Warbler, Chiffchaff, Wood Warbler, Barred Warbler, Irania,<br>
              Semi-collared Flycatcher, White Wagtail and Red-throated
              Pipit. Most<br>
              of these should have representatives already here.<br>
              <br>
              Best for now<br>
