  <pre>Hi Steve,
Thanks so very much for sending this detail on Lesser Striped Swallows
in. On Tuesday I was in NNP all day, in all the favourite haunts for
Lesser Striped, there were none to be seen even though Red-rumped were
gathering mud in puddles.
Yesterday (Wed), one flew over the house calling, staying high and
flying over without any deviation. I concluded this was not one of our
birds. Today our pair were back and singing on their favourite
perches.
It would be really good if people could write in when they see their
first, as I suspect in the next couple of days they could be
everywhere, which would suggest a mass movement back to Nairobi.
Without this information, the migration of the species back into
Nairobi will continue to remain a mystery.

Best for now
Brian

Hello Brian,
You were asking for sightings of lesser-striped swallows returning to
Nairobi. I saw several feeding at the dam on the Kofinaf coffee estate, off
Ngenda Road, north of Kiambu, on Sunday Nov. 20. Still, none have returned
yet to where I have often seen them off Lower Kabete in Nairobi.
Regards,
Steve Graham
