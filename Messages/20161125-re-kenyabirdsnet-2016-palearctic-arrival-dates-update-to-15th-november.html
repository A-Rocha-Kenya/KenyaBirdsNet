  <div dir="ltr">Dear Steve, Brian and all,<br><br>On Sunday 20th Nov, during a Nature Kenya Sunday bird watch, we saw about 5 Lesser Striped Swallows busy building mud nests under the roof of one of the houses at Ziwani Retreat Centre (between Juja and Thika). There was a high diversity of swallows/martins including Barn, Wire-tailed and Red-rumped Swallows, Black Saw-wing, Plain Martin and Rock Martin. Migrants included Blackcap, Black Stork and Eurasian Swifts. The area was also interesting as we saw birds of forest, bush and grassland. Brown-backed and White-browed Scrub Robin were both seen. Raptors also abounded, including Lanner Falcon (2 adults and juv), Ayres Hawk-Eagle, Augur Buzzard, African Fish Eagle, Black-chested Snake Eagle and Gymnogene.<br><br>Regards,<br>Sidney</div><div class="gmail_extra"><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Thu, Nov 24, 2016 at 7:11 PM, Brian Finch <a href="mailto:birdfinch@gmail.com">birdfinch@gmail.com</a> [kenyabirdsnet] <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:kenyabirdsnet-noreply@yahoogroups.com" target="_blank">kenyabirdsnet-noreply@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex">

      <p>Hi Steve,<br>
Thanks so very much for sending this detail on Lesser Striped Swallows<br>
in. On Tuesday I was in NNP all day, in all the favourite haunts for<br>
Lesser Striped, there were none to be seen even though Red-rumped were<br>
gathering mud in puddles.<br>
Yesterday (Wed), one flew over the house calling, staying high and<br>
flying over without any deviation. I concluded this was not one of our<br>
birds. Today our pair were back and singing on their favourite<br>
perches.<br>
It would be really good if people could write in when they see their<br>
first, as I suspect in the next couple of days they could be<br>
everywhere, which would suggest a mass movement back to Nairobi.<br>
Without this information, the migration of the species back into<br>
Nairobi will continue to remain a mystery.<br>
<br>
Best for now<br>
Brian<br>

Hello Brian,<br>
You were asking for sightings of lesser-striped swallows returning to<br>
Nairobi. I saw several feeding at the dam on the Kofinaf coffee estate, off<br>
Ngenda Road, north of Kiambu, on Sunday Nov. 20. Still, none have returned<br>
yet to where I have often seen them off Lower Kabete in Nairobi.<br>
Regards,<br>
Steve Graham<br>
