<BR>
On Amur Falcons, Jennifer Oduori reports that &#8220;at 5 pm on November 26, nine Amur falcons flew low over my roof (in Eastlands near Buru Buru) before it started raining. They were riding on the wind.&#8221;<BR>
<BR>
On warblers, Nature Kenya&#8217;s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk remained at the Nairobi National Museum on 30 November, and recorded Willow Warbler, Eastern Olivaceous Warbler, Common Whitethroat, Blackcap and Garden Warbler, as well as Spotted Flycatcher.<BR>
<BR>
Wishing you good birding, Fleur<BR>

Dear Sidney and Steve,<BR>
Thanks for the Lesser Striped Swallow updates, it does seem that they<BR>
are back in the area but would be great to hear from others when they<BR>
first see them.<BR>
Your experience with the Amurs is magical, when at an alate emergence<BR>
they dash around madly taking no interest of your presence. Very large<BR>
numbers must pass over Nairobi unseen, but early morning they can be<BR>
moving quite low, and in the evening when looking for roost sites they<BR>
also come within visual distance.<BR>
Very best<BR>
Brian<BR>

&gt; Dear Brian,<BR>
&gt; By Sunday, several Red-rumped Swallows had returned to a regular haunt<BR>
&gt; along Lower Kabete, near Farasi Lane, while a single bird was among<BR>
&gt; assorted hirundines feeding over a sports field in Gigiri on Saturday<BR>
&gt; morning. I saw another on the edge of Karura Forest on Monday.<BR>
&gt; The thunderstorm that rolled over Nairobi on Saturday evening brought the<BR>
&gt; most magical birding experience I have had in Kenya: the rain triggered a<BR>
&gt; tremendous termite hatch around my home, and presumably pushed many a<BR>
&gt; migrant down toward the ground. First one, then two, then more and more<BR>
&gt; falcons appeared from the murk, flying around the heads of my family as we<BR>
&gt; stood mesmerized in the rain in our garden. Amur Falcons, with maybe some<BR>
&gt; Red-footed among them though it was hard to tell, at least 30 in all. After<BR>
&gt; a quarter-hour they moved on, but we won't forget them.<BR>
&gt; Regards,<BR>

&gt;&gt; Dear Steve, Brian and all,<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; On Sunday 20th Nov, during a Nature Kenya Sunday bird watch, we saw about<BR>
&gt;&gt; 5 Lesser Striped Swallows busy building mud nests under the roof of one<BR>
&gt;&gt; of<BR>
&gt;&gt; the houses at Ziwani Retreat Centre (between Juja and Thika). There was a<BR>
&gt;&gt; high diversity of swallows/martins including Barn, Wire-tailed and<BR>
&gt;&gt; Red-rumped Swallows, Black Saw-wing, Plain Martin and Rock Martin.<BR>
&gt;&gt; Migrants<BR>
&gt;&gt; included Blackcap, Black Stork and Eurasian Swifts. The area was also<BR>
&gt;&gt; interesting as we saw birds of forest, bush and grassland. Brown-backed<BR>
&gt;&gt; and<BR>
&gt;&gt; White-browed Scrub Robin were both seen. Raptors also abounded, including<BR>
&gt;&gt; Lanner Falcon (2 adults and juv), Ayres Hawk-Eagle, Augur Buzzard,<BR>
&gt;&gt; African<BR>
&gt;&gt; Fish Eagle, Black-chested Snake Eagle and Gymnogene.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; Regards,<BR>

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Steve,<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks so very much for sending this detail on Lesser Striped Swallows<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; in. On Tuesday I was in NNP all day, in all the favourite haunts for<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Lesser Striped, there were none to be seen even though Red-rumped were<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; gathering mud in puddles.<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yesterday (Wed), one flew over the house calling, staying high and<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; flying over without any deviation. I concluded this was not one of our<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; birds. Today our pair were back and singing on their favourite<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; perches.<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; It would be really good if people could write in when they see their<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; first, as I suspect in the next couple of days they could be<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; everywhere, which would suggest a mass movement back to Nairobi.<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Without this information, the migration of the species back into<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Nairobi will continue to remain a mystery.<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Best for now<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Brian<BR>

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello Brian,<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; You were asking for sightings of lesser-striped swallows returning to<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Nairobi. I saw several feeding at the dam on the Kofinaf coffee estate,<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; off<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ngenda Road, north of Kiambu, on Sunday Nov. 20. Still, none have<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; returned<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; yet to where I have often seen them off Lower Kabete in Nairobi.<BR>
