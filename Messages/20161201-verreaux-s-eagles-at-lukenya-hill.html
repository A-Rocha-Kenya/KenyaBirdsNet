  <div dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Dear all,</p>
<p dir="ltr">On Tuesday 29th Nov I was at Lukenya Hill with Akhil Varma and we saw Verreaux&#39;s Eagles in 2 separate sightings. First we saw a juv with 1 adult and then the 2nd sighting was of an adult pair. The adult from the sighting with the juv is also most likely one of the ones we saw in the 2nd sighting. All sightings were of birds in flight.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Then yesterday (30th) Akhil was back on the hill with Dr. Jan Van Duiden and they located the pair&#39;s nest. (See photos attached. The birds in flight are from Tuesday and the nest was photographed by Akhil yesterday.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Does anyone here have records of this species at Lukenya in recent years (from say 2010 onwards)? I was under the impression that they had been extirpated from the hill years ago but it seems that&#39;s not the case.<br><br>Regards,<br>Sidney</p>
