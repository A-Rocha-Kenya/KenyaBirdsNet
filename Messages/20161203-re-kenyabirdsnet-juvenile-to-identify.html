  <pre>Dear Patrick,
Sorry for the delay in replying. Immature Pin-tailed Whydahs (and the
others as well), are so very different from adult male or adult female
plumages and a pitfall. Also it seems that not all immature whydahs
pass through this plain stage, but in saying that I have never seen a
bird quite like yours in East Africa,
Very best
Brian

&gt; Hi Patrick,
&gt;
&gt; I have no idea what this is but when you find out please let me know. It
&gt; looks very &#39;sparrow-like&#39; but that bill looks very odd for a Passer sp.,
&gt; maybe a peculiar weaver maybe?
&gt;
&gt; You have me stumped!
&gt;
&gt; I hope you are keeping very well.
&gt;
&gt; Adam

&gt; Can anyone help me to identify this juvenile?
