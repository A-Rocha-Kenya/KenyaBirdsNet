&gt; Hi Jez,
&gt; I saw your image, and immediately had reservations.
&gt; I thought the overall shape and the bill slightly too short for
&gt; Common, the black nape
&gt; looked too small and neat, the legs were retaining bright red and
&gt; should be darker red now, the upperparts were very uniform and paler
&gt; grey than I would expect on a Common, the carpal bar was small and not
&gt; as prominent as a winter plumage Common should show, this could be
&gt; some vestige of breeding plumage still retained, and the bird is more
&gt; squat than a Common which usually appears attenuated.
&gt; In the second image the tail shows a straight-edged gentle fork,
&gt; whereas in Common there should be some outer-tail projection and an
&gt; overall deeper fork. The outer primaries are grey and blackish in
&gt; Common giving more contrast on the closed wing.
&gt; To date there has never been a Common Tern convincingly recorded in
&gt; the Nairobi region, but such a nice image,
&gt; Very best
&gt; Brian

&gt; Very best
