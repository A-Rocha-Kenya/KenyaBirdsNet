  <pre>Dear All,
Following on from my tern tirade, a few people have enquired for more
details regarding the publication &#34;Britain&#39;s Birds.&#34;
Don&#39;t be put off by the title in relation to East African birds, it
has the best coverage of virtually all of our migrants that I have
ever seen, and covers every extant species ever recorded UK and
Ireland, that&#39;s way over 600 species! Gosh Britain has beaten Nairobi
National Park!

&#34;Britain&#39;s Birds&#34; Hume, Still, Swash....  Princeton University
Press  ...Wild Guides 2016
ISBN 978-0-691-15889-1

Best for now
Brian
