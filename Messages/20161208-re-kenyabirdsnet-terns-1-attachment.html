      <p>Dear All,<br>
Just a few comments on the naming of White-winged Tern.<br>
<br>
When a bird changes its common name to something novel, then it should<br>
be for an improvement in the name that corrects something that was<br>
misleading in the original. Forget atrocities like Spotted Palm Thrush<br>
for which the majority from hatching to falling off their perches will<br>
never ever even see a palm. That was a stupid change if ever there was<br>
one, but I want to go back to the terns.<br>
<br>
Since time immemorial Chlidonias leucopterus has been called<br>
White-winged Black Tern, it is in fact the worlds only black tern with<br>
white wings, a perfectly good name you would think. If you out there<br>
had discovered this bird in its breeding plumage as new to science, I<br>
am sure you would have called it White-winged Black Tern. Let’s face<br>
it, 90% of the worlds tern species differ in having whitish<br>
flight-feathers i.e. they have white wings. So what inane individual<br>
(come on whoever you are own up!),  thought it would be an improvement<br>
to remove a name that described a completely unique feature, for a<br>
name that could equally befit 90% of all the world’s terns. It’s sheer<br>
idiocy and I for one will never support the name White-winged Tern for<br>
the species.<br>
So it may be listed in four major checklists of the world’s birds, but<br>
it is not these checklists that dictate common usage, it’s the<br>
field-guides to the regional birds that will determine what the local<br>
birding population will be calling their birds.<br>
<br>
The recently published “Britain’s Birds” has to be the most incredible<br>
field-guide for any country I have ever seen and it will be the most<br>
used in Britain for very many years to come. So I looked up Chlidonias<br>
leucopterus and there it was White-winged Black Tern, and so it will<br>
be for all who follow this book. I have attached the relevant double<br>
spread so you can appreciate it for yourselves and also appreciate<br>
what a fine volume this is.<br>
<br>
Personally I think the name of White-winged Tern is going to be short<br>
lived, let’s start the revolt!!!<br>
<br>
Best to all<br>
Brian<br>
