  <pre>Greetings birders

At Paradise Lost, on the edge of Nairobi in Kiambu, Nature Kenya&#39;s Wednesday
Morning Birdwalk saw and photographed a Black-crowned Tchagra Â­ an uncommon
bird in the Nairobi area. Migrants included Booted Eagle, Blackcap and
Willow Warbler.

At the Ura River gate of Meru National Park, with Catherine Ngarachu and
Joseph Kariuki on 3 December, African Emerald Cuckoo and Grey-olive Greenbul
were calling, and a single Alpine Swift flew over. Crested Guineafowl were
seen a few kilometres to the north. We also saw a large, crested, all black
cuckoo, that we thought was a black-morph Levaillant&#39;s Cuckoo.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
