  <pre>Greetings birders

Glad to report that a pair of Golden-tailed Woodpeckers were once again seen
in the Ngong Road Forest at the Racecourse by Nature Kenya&#39;s Wednesday
Morning Birdwalk on 12 Oct. The large size, long beak and heavy streaking
below were well seen.

We also saw three bee-eaters: Eurasian, Cinnamon-chested, and Little. A
Willow Warbler made a brief appearance, and we heard that one was ringed at
the Nairobi Museum yesterday.

With best wishes from Fleur
