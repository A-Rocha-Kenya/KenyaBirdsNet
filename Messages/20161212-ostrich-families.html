  <pre>Greetings birders

In Nairobi National Park on 11 Dec with Bettina Ng&#39;weno, we saw three
different families of ostriches with a dozen half-grown young. The young
were of slightly different sizes, and in two cases there were four adults
present, apparently two sets of parents.

Also a large group of young adult ostriches in bright plumage, warthog
piglets, impala fawns, fighting eland, a pride of lions, a flock of
long-distance sandpipers Â­ what an amazing spectacle on our doorstep.

Save Nairobi National Park! Fleur
