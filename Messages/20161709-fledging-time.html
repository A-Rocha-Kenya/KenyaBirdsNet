  <pre>Greetings birders

At Paradise Lost on the edge of Nairobi, Nature Kenya&#39;s Wednesday Morning
Birdwalk recorded 73 species in about 3 hours on June 8. There was a large
amount of water going over the waterfall, magnificent. We noted many birds
with young:

White-backed Ducks with several ducklings
Great Cormorant colony nesting in a dry eucalyptus
Common Moorhen and African Jacana with half-grown young
Hoopoe with a flying but duller juvenile
Cinnamon-chested Bee-eaters with several young with greenish chests
Holub&#39;s Golden Weaver just-fledged chick begging incessantly
Mountain Wagtail feeding young in their nest behind the waterfall!

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
