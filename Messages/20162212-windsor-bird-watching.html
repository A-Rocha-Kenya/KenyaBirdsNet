  <p><span>Today at my morning birds survey I had around forty birds species, what I have seen new was juvenile of the Spur-Winged Goose with the adult, the juvenile is so grayish it was so disturbing pushing the adult and scaring other birds like Greater cormorant, Reed cormorants and Yellow billed duck on a slanting branch to the lake. Other side was Eurasia mash harrier on branch near the lake, first time to see it here.</span></p><p>Enjoy birding&nbsp;</p><p>Jonathan Mwachongo&nbsp;</p><p><span><br></span></p>
