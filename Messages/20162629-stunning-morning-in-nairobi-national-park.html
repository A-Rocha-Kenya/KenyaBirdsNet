  <pre>Greetings birders

Clouds were dark and low over dry, dusty Nairobi National Park at 8 am this
morning for a family visit. But what a totally stunning two and a half hours
it turned out to be!

First a Marsh Owl flying over grassland where the road from East Gate meets
the main road through the park; then a small flock of Orange-breasted
(Zebra) Waxbills; followed be a big flock of mainly young Wattled Starlings
feeding on an old carcass.

We met George Kamau, who wondered whether we would like to know where the
lions were, although it was not a bird? Yes, we did, but first we had to
drive through a huge herd of buffalo, attended by Cattle Egrets, Wattled
Starlings and Yellow-billed Oxpeckers.

The two lions had been mating right by the side of road at number 4.

The final lap of the morning, Hyena Dam to Nagolomon Dam, was full of land
and waterbirds, including a magnificent pair of Saddle-billed Stork, an
African Open-billed Stork, African Darters, African Fish Eagle and Grey
Crowned Cranes.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
