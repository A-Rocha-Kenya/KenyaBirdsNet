  <p><span>Dear birders i am glad to share my today the 24 October 2016 birds sighting. As I was taken for a coffee visit tour it was lovely and interesting tour, so what? At the same time birds were calling and flying passing us, the real striking moment is when we were at the point farmers were harvesting Coffee, as they were busy callecting the berries under neath were number of yellow Wagtail at least I counted 8 of them near their feet. When I asked one of the farmer he said they are waiting to pick the fallen berries and suck the sugar part in the berries and after they will eat the berries. It was fascinating to me while at sky around 15 Eurasia bee eaters were cycles round and round, later an African hoopoe on a flight carrying something in it&#39;s mouth.</span></p><p><span>It was a mix of birds activities and human work.</span></p><p><span>Great birding</span></p><p><span>Jonathan Mwachongo&nbsp;</span></p>
