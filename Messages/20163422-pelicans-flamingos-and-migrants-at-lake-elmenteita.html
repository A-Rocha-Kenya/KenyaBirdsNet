  <pre>Greetings birders

Nature Kenya&#39;s Sunday Birdwatch spent some delightful hours on the shores of
Lake Elmenteita, by kind invitation of Lake Elmenteita Serena Camp. It was
at midday because on the heavy traffic to and from Nairobi, but the lake was
beautiful and the birds abundant.

Great White Pelicans are nesting on the islands in the lake. The pelicans
presumably brought in fish from Lake Nakuru, so we saw many rafts of white
pelicans fishing cooperatively. I guesstimate that there were about a
thousand Lesser Flamingo on the western tip of the lake, and some 400
Greater Flamingo.

Migrants who had arrived included Common Greenshank, Wood Sandpiper, Common
Sandpiper, Little Stint, Ruff, Gull-billed Tern and White-winged Black Tern.

Other notable birds were about 100 Cape Teal; and Black Cuckoo, Red-chested
Cuckoo and Broad-billed Roller.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
