&gt; Dear All,
&gt;
&gt; When I set out on Oct27th to see what Bamburi Forest Trails was harbouring
&gt; I never expected to find a Spotted Ground Thrush vigorously foraging at
&gt; 2:40 p.m. in leaf litter along the leisure walk trail. I watched it for
&gt; about 30Min. before it flew off into dense undergrowth. I went back
&gt; yesterday to try my luck again but it was not to be.
&gt; GPS co-ordinates are available in case anyone is interested. I also mapped
&gt; the bird &amp; submitted the card (pentad 0355_3940) to KBM.
&gt;
&gt; Best regards
