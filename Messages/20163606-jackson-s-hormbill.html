  <p><span>Greetings All,</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>On my way back from Watamu in August I passed through Tsavo East and drove along the Galana River. &nbsp;Took a picture of the attached bird which I initially thought was a Van-der-Dekens female. &nbsp;After discovering that it could be a Jacksons Female albeit a country mile outside its normal range I have spent two months looking at picures, reading up every scrap of information and sharing it with everyone I could think of. 99% sure this is a Jacksons seen in Tsavo East. &nbsp; &nbsp;Brian Finch and Mike Davidson asked me to post it here as apparently there is no record of any sighting east of the rift valley.</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p>Regards,</p><p><br></p><p>James Kashangaki</p>
