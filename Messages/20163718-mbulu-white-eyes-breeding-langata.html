  <pre>Dear All,
I have been through the video of the adult and immature White-eyes
again, and have frozen the adult side on to camera, so that the
proportions of the eye-wattle can be seen. I think that this image
completely rules out their being of race jacksoni of Yellow White-eye
and with the extensive lower lobe suggests that they belong in the
Montane White-eye grouping which includes Mbulu. The immature has a
much smaller eye-wattle and more regular but not so with this adult
where the lower half is exaggerated and the upper half quite normal,
Comments welcome,
Best for now
Brian
