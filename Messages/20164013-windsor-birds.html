  <p>The breeding of Sacred ibis has been successful to one of island here, we use to count hundred of the ibis but now all left and since last week i have been counting less than ten sacred ibis. To day i saw African Harrier Hawk in breeding season and at least 10 Eurasian Bee- eaters, Spekes Weavers males singing and African Golden Weavers making nest where the Sacred Ibis had nested for the last 5 month.</p><p>Great birding</p><p>Jonathan&nbsp;</p>
