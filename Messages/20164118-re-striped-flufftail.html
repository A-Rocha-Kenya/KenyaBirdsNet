  <pre>Dear Christian;   This is a truly excellent sighting indeed.  That 
high altitude tussock grassland is indeed the habitat of Striped 
Flufftail, and there have been several historical records from there, 
the last being a reported sighting near Satima peak in February 1974. 
A flufftail that high up with an all-red tail could only be a 
Striped, and so after 42 years its really great to have this. Many 
congratulations.

Could you possibly expand the details for us with a brief account of 
your two sightings, date and particularly the altitude etc.  A brief 
description of the bird would also help.

Thanks and very best wishes
Don Turner
