  <div dir="ltr"><div>Dear All,</div><div><br></div><div>When I set out on Oct27th to see what Bamburi Forest Trails was harbouring I never expected to find a Spotted Ground Thrush vigorously foraging at 2:40 p.m. in leaf litter along the leisure walk trail. I watched it for about 30Min. before it flew off into dense undergrowth. I went back yesterday to try my luck again but it was not to be.  </div><div>GPS co-ordinates are available in case anyone is interested. I also mapped the bird &amp; submitted the card (pentad 0355_3940) to KBM.</div><div><br></div><div>Best regards</div><div>Doris V. Schaule</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>
