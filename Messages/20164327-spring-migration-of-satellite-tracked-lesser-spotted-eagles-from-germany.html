<br>
<font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As usual we are again showing GPS satellite-tracking results&nbsp; (see www.satellite-telemetry.de) of nine of our Lesser Spotted Eagles on spring migration 2016. The English version still shows the autumn migration routes in 2015, but soon also spring 2016 will be shown. The German version has already the 2016 tracks. All the eagles which we track survived up to now from leaving Germany in September&nbsp; 2015 up to now (end of March 2016), and we hope, of course, that they will all return savely.<br>
<br>
All nine&nbsp; birds are adults, two of them were fitted with satellite tags as nestlings&nbsp; by myself. The male bred successfully for the first time&nbsp; two years ago when five years old. The female did not even try to breed last year when she was also five years old.<br>
<br>
The oldest bird with a still working PTT was born and ringed in 2000. We&nbsp; trapped it in 2004 when it was four years old and when it bred successfully. Ever since this female used the old nesting site except in two years when no male arrived. In this two years the female tryed to take over a nest 35 km from its own eyrie but was driven away there after some days when the old female&nbsp; arrived. Except in these two years (2005 and 2006) she reared a nestling in most seasons beeing one of the most successaful breeders of the area.<br>
<br>
Although the PTT is still working there are too few GPS fixes now to show an accurate track, but we know that the bird wintered again in Nambia and is now on its way home. There are two photos shown of this eagle taken by a photo trap (in 2013 the bird alone at a bait near the nest and again in 2014 together with its mate).<br>
<br>
Best wishes,<br>
