  <pre>It may be of some interest that back in 1979, the small ringing team at Ngulia caught and ringed two African Crakes, on 17 and 18 November; both birds were picked up inside the Lodge, one of them by a helpful Japanese tourist. They are the only ones ever caught at Ngulia in all the years ringing has taken place, 1969 to 2015.
