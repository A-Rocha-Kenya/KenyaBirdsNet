  <p dir="ltr">Hi all,</p>
<p dir="ltr">While in a matatu on Langata Rd today, I spotted 1 adult Crowned Eagle on the nest opposite Wildlife Clubs of Kenya. The sighting was very brief but I got a good look. This was around 20 minutes ago. I think this is the 1st time a C Eagle has been seen on that nest in a while.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Best regards,<br>
Sidney </p>
