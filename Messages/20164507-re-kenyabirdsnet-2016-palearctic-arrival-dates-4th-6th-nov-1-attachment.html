  <p dir="ltr">Hi Brian and All, not sure if Greater Whitethroat has been reported yet this autumn but Simon Carter and I found a single bird in Lower Kabete today. Also a Red-tailed Shrike showing nice contrast between rufous crown and pale sandy mantle.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cheers, James</p>

      <p>Dear All,<br>
Continuing the migrant watch report, this morning (4th) was gloomy and<br>
still no rain. It was also cool and birds were not eager to move much.<br>
There was a small passage of Common Swifts but White-rumped are<br>
actually increasing and hanging around old nest sites, a dozen<br>
Eurasian Bee-eaters were in the area, a Eurasian Golden Oriole was<br>
heading south, a House Martin going north, eight or so Willow Warblers<br>
and two Blackcaps (both males). The only other migrant was a Spotted<br>
Flycatcher.<br>
At 9.30am James Bradley came around and we returned to the paddock. He<br>
came at the right time as a Long-legged Buzzard was heading south<br>
directly overhead but apart from unseen calling Yellow Wagtails there<br>
were no other migrant additions.<br>
<br>
We then went down to the Icross Road (Elangata Wuas Rd) just a little<br>
way down the Magadi Road and spent the rest of the day in that area.<br>
Migrants were a group of seven Common Buzzards coming in to find a<br>
roosting place, a hepatic Eurasian Cuckoo, a dozen Eurasian Bee-eaters<br>
along the wires, a Red-tailed Shrike sp (only seen in flight so not<br>
identified), a male Red-backed Shrike, a scattering of Barn Swallows<br>
but no major passage, the only migrant warbler seen there was a<br>
stunning Olive Tree that initially stayed in the depths of an Acacia<br>
mellifera, but eventually gave itself up and provided excellent open<br>
views, four Eurasian Rock Thrush, over a dozen Northern and three Pied<br>
Wheatears and four Spotted Flycatchers.<br>
<br>
The 5th was quite gloomy and cool when I took my position in the<br>
paddock shortly after 6.00am.  It would be true to say that all day<br>
there was not one instance of any positive visual migration and the<br>
following species were probably all birds that arrived previously. The<br>
migrant raptors were just soaring around low over the trees rather<br>
than making a direct passage overhead. In the morning there was a<br>
Black Stork with undercarriage down for a landing into NNP, the<br>
peculiar sight of eight Ruff heading for NNP, a female-plumaged<br>
Montagu’s/Pallid Harrier  more likely the former on structure,  a few<br>
Common Swifts and Barn Swallows, a few Eurasian Bee-eaters, eight<br>
Willow Warblers, two Blackcaps and a Garden Warbler and the usual two<br>
Spotted Flycatchers plus three Tree Pipits and additionally in the<br>
afternoon two Common Buzzards both pale and one with a very rusty<br>
tail, a pale Booted Eagle, two Eurasian Hobbys and a Eurasian Golden<br>
Oriole.<br>
<br>
Another strange sight mid-morning was a heron that arrived from the<br>
west, that dropped from a great height then circled over the garden<br>
flapping all the time, no heron can soar they all have to flap to stay<br>
airborne but can glide with wings bowed downwards when losing<br>
altitude, this is strange because they have such a large wing area.<br>
Storks that are similarly built are able to soar for long periods. The<br>
bird was an immature Purple Heron, possibly this was a palearctic<br>
arrival some should be crossing the sahara. As with most birds it flew<br>
off low towards NNP.<br>
<br>
Morning of 6th was clammy chilly and overcast but soon brightened up,<br>
but accompanied with a gusty wind. There was some movement at 6.45am<br>
when parties of Swifts came over quite low. They were in groups of up<br>
to fifty flying completely direct, and whilst in dense rotund clusters<br>
each individual skilfully maintained the same distance from all its<br>
neighbours. There were two species involved, the grating screams<br>
easily identified African Black from all other larger swifts, but the<br>
second species was silent, and were all of the entire flock and were<br>
of the returning Pallid-like birds for this season. They were not much<br>
above eye-level and all uniform buff-grey above. One day the species<br>
will make the Kenya list!<br>
Three Tree Pipits circling, four House Martins heading NW and a single<br>
Barn Swallow heading to NNP were the only moving palearctics apart<br>
from the swifts. Whilst in the bushes were a few Willow Warblers and<br>
the currently resident Spotted Flycatcher.<br>
After returning from breakfast for a short while it was still quite<br>
quiet, a Green Sandpiper flew over towards NNP, a fairly dark Common<br>
Buzzard and a pale Booted Eagle were patrolling the valley, there were<br>
a few more Barn Swallows and just before dusk the days only Eurasian<br>
Hobby.<br>
<br>
Best to all<br>
Brian<br>
