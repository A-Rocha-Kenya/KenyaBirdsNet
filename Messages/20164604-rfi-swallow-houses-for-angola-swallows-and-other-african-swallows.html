  <pre>Happy new year birders!

This is a request for information on how to build a swallow nesting house
for Angola Swallows or other East African swallows.

A school near Lake Ol&#39;Bolossat in central Kenya has Angola Swallows nesting
inside the classrooms. The school administrators like the swallows, but want
them out of the building. They have received funding to put up wire mesh to
keep the swallows out once nesting is finished. Now they would like to know
how to attract the swallows to a nesting site in the school grounds but
outside the building.

Can anyone share information on how to build a swallow house for Angola
Swallows? Or for any other swallows found in East Africa?

Do you have any experience with made-made swallow nesting sites in Africa?

Thank you so much for any information you can provide,

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
