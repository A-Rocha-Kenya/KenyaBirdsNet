  <div dir="ltr">Interesting. Thank you Brian. I always thought of Martial Eagle as a bird of open and lightly wooded country. <br><br>It seems the African Hawk-Eagles might be seriously considering nesting in NNP, if they aren&#39;t already. It&#39;s also possible that they could nest immediately south of the park in the Kitengela area as there are a couple of well wooded river valleys (along seasonal tributaries of the Mbagathi). There is definitely no shortage of game birds and small mammals for them to hunt. A recent encouraging development is that the Masai community in this area is in the process of forming a community conservancy, which would serve as a buffer against the growing Kitengela town.<br><br>Happy birding,<br><br>Sidney</div><div class="gmail_extra"><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Wed, Jul 13, 2016 at 12:49 PM, Brian Finch <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:birdfinch@gmail.com" target="_blank">birdfinch@gmail.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex">Dear Sidney,<br>
Some nice records for the Park area. There was a pair of adult African<br>
Hawk-Eagles that took up a short residence along the Mbagathi not far<br>
from Hippo Pools Oct/Nov last year. It was hoped that they would nest,<br>
but there was never any evidence. I would imagine this could be the<br>
same pair that you saw.<br>
Bateleurs have long had a nest site along the Kisembe River in the<br>
Kisembe Forest. We cannot get there at present because of the road<br>
becoming treacherous since the flooding. These are the only pair in<br>
the Park but they are often along Mbagathi Gorge.<br>
There has long been a pair of Martial Eagles also in the Kisembe<br>
Forest, which is probably responsible for your Galleria sighting,<br>
there can’t be many shopping malls with Martial Eagle on its list! We<br>
frequently see them over the garden here, and they are often in the<br>
afternoons over the Elephant Orphanage area and are undoubtedly the<br>
same pair as Langata Gate and your Galleria bird.<br>
Martial Eagles are not just in Kisembe Forest, but also in forests<br>
such as Aberdares and Mt Kenya. They are in thick forest also such as<br>
Bwindi in Uganda and Nyungwe in Rwanda, and seem quite versatile.<br>
Best for now<br>

&gt; Hi all,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Yesterday I was in Nairobi National Park and had some interesting eagle<br>
&gt; sightings:<br>
&gt;<br>
</span>&gt;    1.  Pair of African Hawk-Eagles flying above the Mbagathi gorge close to<br>
<span class="">&gt;    Leopard Cliffs. They were heading southwards into the Kitengela<br>
&gt; triangle.<br>
&gt;    Anyone know if they are nesting in NNP or somewhere close by?<br>
</span>&gt;    2. Single male Bateleur flying close to Impala observation point.<br>
&gt;    3. Single adult Martial Eagle circling above the forest very close to<br>
<div class="HOEnZb"><div class="h5">&gt;    the park fence at the Magadi rd/Langata rd junction. I actually spotted<br>
&gt; it<br>
&gt;    from just outside Galleria shopping mall after I had left the park. It<br>
&gt; was<br>
&gt;    a surprise as I do not expect to see Martial Eagle in a forested area.<br>
&gt; It<br>
&gt;    was within no more than 50-100 meters of the park fence and I had no<br>
&gt;    problem identifying it without binoculars. It circled about 5 times<br>
&gt; before<br>
&gt;    heading back into the park. Has anyone else seen this species in this<br>
&gt; part<br>
&gt;    of the park before?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Best regards to all,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Sidney<br>
