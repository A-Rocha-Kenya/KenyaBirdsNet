&gt; Hi Jonathan,
&gt; That&#39;s interesting that the breeding activity of Sacred Ibis suddenly
&gt; stopped recently. It&#39;s the same in NNPark, from dominating Nagalomon
&gt; Dam to breeding all over. I had always assumed that the Ibis around
&gt; Nairobi bred for much of the year, but maybe they do actually have a
&gt; particular season,
&gt; Best for now

&gt;&gt; The breeding of Sacred ibis has been successful to one of island here, we
&gt;&gt; use to count hundred of the ibis but now all left and since last week i have
&gt;&gt; been counting less than ten sacred ibis. To day i saw African Harrier Hawk
&gt;&gt; in breeding season and at least 10 Eurasian Bee- eaters, Spekes Weavers
&gt;&gt; males singing and African Golden Weavers making nest where the Sacred Ibis
&gt;&gt; had nested for the last 5 month.
