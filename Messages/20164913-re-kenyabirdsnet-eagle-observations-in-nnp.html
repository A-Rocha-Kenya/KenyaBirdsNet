      <p>Dear Sidney,<br>
Some nice records for the Park area. There was a pair of adult African<br>
Hawk-Eagles that took up a short residence along the Mbagathi not far<br>
from Hippo Pools Oct/Nov last year. It was hoped that they would nest,<br>
but there was never any evidence. I would imagine this could be the<br>
same pair that you saw.<br>
Bateleurs have long had a nest site along the Kisembe River in the<br>
Kisembe Forest. We cannot get there at present because of the road<br>
becoming treacherous since the flooding. These are the only pair in<br>
the Park but they are often along Mbagathi Gorge.<br>
There has long been a pair of Martial Eagles also in the Kisembe<br>
Forest, which is probably responsible for your Galleria sighting,<br>
there can’t be many shopping malls with Martial Eagle on its list! We<br>
frequently see them over the garden here, and they are often in the<br>
afternoons over the Elephant Orphanage area and are undoubtedly the<br>
same pair as Langata Gate and your Galleria bird.<br>
Martial Eagles are not just in Kisembe Forest, but also in forests<br>
such as Aberdares and Mt Kenya. They are in thick forest also such as<br>
Bwindi in Uganda and Nyungwe in Rwanda, and seem quite versatile.<br>
Best for now<br>
Brian<br>

&gt; Hi all,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Yesterday I was in Nairobi National Park and had some interesting eagle<br>
&gt; sightings:<br>
&gt;<br></span>
&gt;    1.  Pair of African Hawk-Eagles flying above the Mbagathi gorge close to<span class=""><br>
&gt;    Leopard Cliffs. They were heading southwards into the Kitengela<br>
&gt; triangle.<br>
&gt;    Anyone know if they are nesting in NNP or somewhere close by?<br></span>
&gt;    2. Single male Bateleur flying close to Impala observation point.<br>
&gt;    3. Single adult Martial Eagle circling above the forest very close to<span class=""><br>
&gt;    the park fence at the Magadi rd/Langata rd junction. I actually spotted<br>
&gt; it<br>
&gt;    from just outside Galleria shopping mall after I had left the park. It<br>
&gt; was<br>
&gt;    a surprise as I do not expect to see Martial Eagle in a forested area.<br>
&gt; It<br>
&gt;    was within no more than 50-100 meters of the park fence and I had no<br>
&gt;    problem identifying it without binoculars. It circled about 5 times<br>
&gt; before<br>
&gt;    heading back into the park. Has anyone else seen this species in this<br>
&gt; part<br>
&gt;    of the park before?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Best regards to all,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Sidney<br>
&gt;<br>
