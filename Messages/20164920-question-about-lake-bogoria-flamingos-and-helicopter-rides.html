  <div><strong>Subject</strong>: Question about Lake Bogoria flamingos and helicopter rides</div>
  <hr/>
  I have a question for the flamingo experts out there:  are the helicopter rides that take photographers to buzz the flocks at Lake Bogoria bad for the well-being of the Lesser and Greater Flamingos?<div><br></div>I have heard stories about recent egregious behavior (buzzing very low and intentionally flushing/herding flocks) and seen some milder photograph-laden online trip reports that still cause me some concern.  I asked an oblique, veiled question of one of the trip report writers + photographers.  He replied that it&#39;s a minor/temporary disturbance, like spooking a buffalo or hippo on a game drive.<div><br></div><div>But knowing what I do about colonial waterbirds in the New World, and their propensity to abandon roosts and rookeries in response to disturbance, I have doubts and would like to learn more.</div><div><br></div><div>I would appreciate any feedback from flamingo conservationists or researchers on the subject - either off-list or shared with the group. </div><div><br></div><div>I am also curious if there are any height regulations or other protocols that are possibly being ignored by irresponsible helicopter operators?</div><div><br></div><div>Good birding,</div><div><br></div><div>Nate</div>
