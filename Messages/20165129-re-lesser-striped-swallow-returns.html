Hi James,
Thanks for this. You should have them now right through to August,
ours left on 2nd Aug quite suddenly. It&#39;s only a near four month
absence, which might be why it was not noticed in the past. Most
migrants are roughly six on (or more) and six off, so a presence of
eight months appears to have masked the four they were not here,
Best for now
Brian

&gt; I tried to reply to your request on KenyaBirdsNet but was not successful.
&gt; Cant think why.  In case you havent received. I saw a lone lesser striped
&gt; in the garden in Lavington on Monday morning 7am.  Usually we have a large
&gt; number around for a while this time of year.
