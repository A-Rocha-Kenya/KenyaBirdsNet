There is a good photo here (scroll down): <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S16180242" target="_blank">http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S16180242</a><br><br></div>Actually quite a different looking bird, paler overall, whitish and not yellowish underside and cheeks, heavier bill, and a pale rump which is finely streaked brown. Also possibly an absence of greyer tones in the mantle, and black streaking less prominent. Much of this is probably variable with wear and feather age but hopefully photos of other individuals will provide elucidation in the future. This bird has a very &quot;stocky&quot; look to it but I&#39;m not sure I see any part which is obviously House Sparrow. Also no House Sparrows at this site from what I can tell.<br><br></div>Good Birding,<br><br></div>James<br><br><br></div>James Bradley<br></div>Sidney, BC<br><div><div><br><div class="gmail_extra"><div><div class="h5"><br><div class="gmail_quote">On 12 January 2016 at 22:36, Brian Finch <a href="mailto:birdfinch@gmail.com" target="_blank">birdfinch@gmail.com</a> [kenyabirdsnet] <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:kenyabirdsnet-noreply@yahoogroups.com" target="_blank">kenyabirdsnet-noreply@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex">

      <p>Dear All,<br>
I have just received the attached superb images from Kevin Easley, who<br>
photographed the birds at their nest at Archer’s Gate entrance to<br>
Samburu GR last November.<br>
<br>
They are unquestionably nominate Somali Sparrows, and coexisting with<br>
House Sparrows. This is as amazing as the discovery of the birds at<br>
Sala Gate Tsavo East.<br>
<br>
It would seem that the species is spreading, and maybe they are<br>
already at other sites but so far unrecorded..<br>
<br>
Best to all<br>
Brian<br>
