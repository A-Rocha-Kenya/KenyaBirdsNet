  <pre>Dear All,
Every year at exactly this time there is a passage of small to very
large flocks (&gt;2000) over our place, heading S to SW towards the Rift.
The numbers that go over vastly exceed anything that has ever landed
in NNP
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Evening Washington,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for update on NNP on Monday.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I was playing golf at Karen Country Club on Sunday afternoon and about
&gt; 17.00hrs wave after wave of pelicans flew over. I estimated about 300 but
&gt; could have been more. They were in loose formation aka geese and the flight
&gt; motion was similar to watching them on sitting on sea waves gently lifting
&gt; up and down!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; They were heading in a southerly direction and we thought toward Magadi but
&gt; it seems some took a rest in the park.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Sorry but club in hand, no camera!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Just an addition - but we are fortunate at the club to have a young Barn Own
&gt; and parent seen regularly around the club house and even joining members
&gt; close to the upstairs and outside bar!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Happy birding
&gt;
&gt;

&gt; Hallo all,
&gt;
&gt; Last Monday, Fleur Ng&#39;weno, Ben Allen, Jennifer Oduori and myself spent a
&gt; birding day in Nairobi National Park.
&gt;
&gt; The day proved to be very interesting with 157 species recorded.
&gt;
&gt; More interesting were records of: over 20 Great White Pelicans roosting on
&gt; Eucalyptus trees at the main gate, a rare black-billed + black-legged Cattle
&gt; Egret and Yellow-billed Oxpeckers on a Warthog (while they don&#39;t often feed
&gt; on small mammals).
&gt;
&gt; See images.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Kind regards.
&gt;
&gt;
