  <pre>Hi Brian,

I agree 100% - White-winged Tern is an abomination and I will never use it! 

I gather that the reason it was changed is that if you have a &#39;White-winged
Black Tern&#39; then you have to qualify &#39;Black Tern&#39; with something - &#39;Common Black
Tern&#39; perhaps, or &#39;Black-winged Black Tern&#39; but I have never followed the logic
of that.  It seems perfectly clear to me that you can have a &#39;Black Tern&#39; and a
&#39;White-winged Black Tern&#39; without there being any confusion.

I&#39;m forwarding this to Nigel Redman so he can raise it with the IOC team.

Best wishes,

David

&gt; Dear All,
&gt; Just a few comments on the naming of White-winged Tern.
&gt; 
&gt; When a bird changes its common name to something novel, then it should
&gt; be for an improvement in the name that corrects something that was
&gt; misleading in the original. Forget atrocities like Spotted Palm Thrush
&gt; for which the majority from hatching to falling off their perches will
&gt; never ever even see a palm. That was a stupid change if ever there was
&gt; one, but I want to go back to the terns.
&gt; 
&gt; Since time immemorial Chlidonias leucopterus has been called
&gt; White-winged Black Tern, it is in fact the worlds only black tern with
&gt; white wings, a perfectly good name you would think. If you out there
&gt; had discovered this bird in its breeding plumage as new to science, I
&gt; am sure you would have called it White-winged Black Tern. Let’s face
&gt; it, 90% of the worlds tern species differ in having whitish
&gt; flight-feathers i.e. they have white wings. So what inane individual
&gt; (come on whoever you are own up!),  thought it would be an improvement
&gt; to remove a name that described a completely unique feature, for a
&gt; name that could equally befit 90% of all the world’s terns. It’s sheer
&gt; idiocy and I for one will never support the name White-winged Tern for
&gt; the species.
&gt; So it may be listed in four major checklists of the world’s birds, but
&gt; it is not these checklists that dictate common usage, it’s the
&gt; field-guides to the regional birds that will determine what the local
&gt; birding population will be calling their birds.
&gt; 
&gt; The recently published “Britain’s Birds” has to be the most incredible
&gt; field-guide for any country I have ever seen and it will be the most
&gt; used in Britain for very many years to come. So I looked up Chlidonias
&gt; leucopterus and there it was White-winged Black Tern, and so it will
&gt; be for all who follow this book. I have attached the relevant double
&gt; spread so you can appreciate it for yourselves and also appreciate
&gt; what a fine volume this is.
&gt; 
&gt; Personally I think the name of White-winged Tern is going to be short
&gt; lived, let’s start the revolt!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Best to all
&gt; Brian
