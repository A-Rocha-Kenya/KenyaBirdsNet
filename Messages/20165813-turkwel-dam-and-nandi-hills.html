  <p><span>Dear all</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>I have been back in Kenya for a few weeks and have been lucky to visit some interesting areas and see some interesting things.</span></p><p><span style="word-spacing:normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="word-spacing:normal;">Dad, mum and I spent a week in the north rift and in particular at Turkwel dam. We were given permission to put a boat on the dam and so had full access which was amazing. The dam is a beautiful spot and covers a huge area although it is very low at the moment. Wildlife was scarce - baboons, vervet and dikdik</span><span style="word-spacing:normal;">&nbsp;were seen and I heard a leopard on two occasions. One really noticeable thing is the number of rock hyrax around the lake - thousands and thousands! I have a theory that as the lake is still relatively new - 27 years old - the displacement of hyrax the flooding caused pushed them to the edges and so a population boom has occurred, waiting for a disease outbreak to occur as predators are few and far between... Any thoughts?</span></p><p><span style="word-spacing:normal;"><br></span></p><p>The dry-country birdlife was as good as ever but bird life on the dam was actually limited, I think this is mainly because there isn&#39;t a reed habitat as the dam level fluctuates so much that reeds either flood or dry depending on the rapid changes in level. White winged and whiskered terns were numerous as were yellow billed storks, fish eagles and giant kingfishers. Ospreys were seen - 6 individuals on the dam I would estimate. Interestingly one species that was everywhere, day and night, was black crowned night herons - in very large numbers. Green backed-herons were also numerous. Waders were limited to common greenshanks and three banded plovers - that was all which was strange - again maybe a lack of mud flat/reed habitat?</p><p>Long-tailed and great cormorants, darters and pink-backed pelicans were thriving. One little grebe seen. Grey and black headed herons, hammerkop&#39;s, african spoonbills and pied kingfishers present. Little and intermediate egrets are doing well.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw one Abdims stork which looked really out of place amongst the yellow billed storks. But the best sighting for the area was a <span style="font-weight:bold;">stripe-breasted seed eater</span> - my first siting and really exciting to see despite just being a LBJ! Another noticeable and beautiful species was large numbers of bristle crowned starlings which were actually quite tame for once. Birds of prey were few and far between - Augur buzzard, Verraux eagles (happy with all the hyrax I&#39;m sure!), Shikra, Gabar goshawk, E. pale chanting goshawk, pygmy falcon. Spotted eagle owls were really vocal. Also managed to spot the elusive stone partridge... Always a pleasure.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a very healthy population of crocodiles on the lake which was great too see despite lots of fishermen&#39;s nets - and they weren&#39;t shy so hopefully they aren&#39;t being persecuted too badly. Lots of tilapia, catfish and some barbel. It&#39;s an interesting dam but birdlife wasn&#39;t as good as I had expected. The fluctuating levels may be a factor but maybe also because it is still a relatively new dam. I wonder if the migrants have discovered it properly yet? Lots to research there I feel and it would be interesting to visit in the middle of the northern winter and see what migrants are there.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been in Nandi for a while where the birdlife is also brilliant. One strange thing I have noticed in the garden where I am staying, which I am struggling to explain, is that <span style="font-weight:bold;">all </span>of the pied wagtails have clubbed feet - most of them just one but some both feet. They literally have just a stump at the level of the distal tarsus. Amazingly they are coping fine but do look a bit scruffy. It&#39;s just the local population though as 20 minutes away they are fine. My thoughts are: genetic trait, burnt from coals/kuni booster, fungal/bacterial infection, trapping, siafu ant damage, something to do with pesticide/fertiliser sprayed on crops... Has anyone seen this before and know why? They have evaded a photo so far but I will keep trying.</p><p><br></p><p>Leaf loves and double toothed barbets are regular.&nbsp;<span style="word-spacing:normal;">Scaley-throated honeyguides in Koru impossible to see until I played them the call on the E. African birds app which attracted them instantly.</span><span style="word-spacing:normal;">&nbsp;A white spotted fluff tail called in by whistling back to it was the birding highlight. The most special siting so far though was three clawless otters in one of the dams - I had never seen them before despite so much looking so that made my day!</span></p><p><br></p><p>Migrants seen = barn swallows, willow warblers, white-throated and Eurasian bee-eaters. Not many though.</p><p><br></p><p>I will get round to filling the bird map pentads as soon as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Cheers</p><p><br></p><p>Kieran</p>
