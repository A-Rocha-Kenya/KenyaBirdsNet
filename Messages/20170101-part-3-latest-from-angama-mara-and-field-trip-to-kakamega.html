  <pre>Dear All,

Due to a manic 4 days of birding and travelling, this list is not the most
comprehensive and there are some unfortunte memory gaps but I wanted to
share some highlights since my previous posting.

Cheers for now,
Adam

Firstly, an omission from my previous report;

12th March on walk through neighbouring wooded valley. 1 Black Cuckoo of
the race *jacksoni*.


14th March

Big raptor passage over camp between 8.30am – 11am, involving 300+ Steppe
Buzzard, 8 Lesser Spotted Eagle (another 6 ‘probables’ that were distant
but almost certainly this species), 4 Steppe Eagle, 3 Lesser Kestrel,
supported by a local cast of 6 Tawny eagle, 3 Wahlberg’s Eagle, 2
Black-chested Snake-eagle, 1 Brown Snake-eagle, 4 Black Kite (two showing
signs of Asian form *intermedius*), 2 African Harrier-hawk, 1 Great
Sparrowhawk. Oh, plus 30-40 White-backed Vultures. Amazing!


15th March

30+ Steppe Buzzard, 2 Steppe Eagle, 2 Lesser Spotted Eagles seen around
11am. Rock-loving Cisticola seen and heard around tent area.


16th March

An early morning drive into the MT from camp; personal highlight were 2
Black-backed Cisticola (males), 15 Tree Pipits, 1 Eurasian Hobby, 2
Red-winged Francolin (heard not seen, again!), 50+ Eurasian Bee-eater, 1
Spotted Flycatcher.
