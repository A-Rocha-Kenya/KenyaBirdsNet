  <hr/>
  I will post photos later this evening, but I wanted to get the word out as soon as possible in case any nearby birders want to try for it tomorrow.<div><br></div><div>Today at 3:45pm just before high tide, Roger Smith, Ben Mugambi and I had a confiding Pacific Golden-Plover among Common Ringed Plovers and other usual suspects at Mida Creek.</div><div><br></div>I first spotted the bird at a fair distance and thought &quot;hold on, this brown-amber Plover with the pretty supercilium and fine sharp-tipped bill looks like a Golden-Plover&quot;.    Just then a Peregrine flushed everything and lost track of it.   Argh - I was dreadfully afraid it was one that got away.<div><br></div><div>Then I spotted it again 15 minutes later roosting with a bunch of Common Ringed Plovers and managed to stalk around to the good light side of the bird for good photos.   Roger and Ben both managed surprisingly good digiscope photos and I got some from the other side with my DSLR.</div><div><br></div><div>Nathan Dias - Charleston, South Carolina </div><div><br></div><div>PS   </div><div>We have found some other nice rare / out of range birds during the past couple of weeks, particularly in the Trans Mara - more details and photos to come.</div>
