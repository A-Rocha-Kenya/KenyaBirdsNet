  Thanks to all who have written with gentle corrections on the Plover ID.<div><br></div><div>I had considered Caspian but did not have a field guide handy and thought Caspian had a different color breast band than our bird.  And in the rich afternoon light, it was glowing quite golden which got my mind on the wrong track.</div><div><br></div><div>In addition to the needle-like bill, it also seemed a bit small and slim for PGP - I should not have ignored that little voice in my head saying &quot;wrong jizz&quot;.<br></div><div><br></div><div>I shall write all you kind folks who shared info and advice individually when I have a better Internet connection.</div><div><br></div><div>Good birding,</div><div><br></div><div>Nate</div>
