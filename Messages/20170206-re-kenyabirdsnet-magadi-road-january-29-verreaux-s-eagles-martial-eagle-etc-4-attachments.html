  <pre>Hi Brian,

Yes, Ben mentioned how denuded  the former woodlands  were at the
base of  the  Olepolos Cliffs at the first I-cross Road.  Like so much
of Kenya, I would have loved to see the area a couple of decades ago.

In terms of the Bare-faced Go-Away Bird - I did not realize it was
rare at that location or I would have snapped a photo.  I will ask my
friend Roger if he happened to snap one.

The BF Go-Away Bird was in my field notes in the 8:45 section.   Far
downhill from Corner Baridi and not terribly far before the turn to
the first I-cross Road if I figure things correctly.

The habitat had opened up and flattened out, we passed some Zebra and
a pair of Crowned  Plovers and saw a Black-billed Weaver.   Then we
had the BF Go-away Bird, closely followed by Hildebrandt&#39;s Starling,
Laughing Dove, Grey-capped Social Weaver and a couple of Chestnut
Sparrows feeding beside the road.

The timestamp on my Chestnut Sparrow photos says 9:05:44am so the BF
Go-Away bird just was a few minutes before that.

We got to the parking area at the first I-cross Road at 9:30am, after
driving for about 15 minutes from  the  previous birding  stop.

Hope this helps a little and I will let y&#39;all know if Roger took a
photo of the BF Go-away bird with timestamps or background reference
points that could help determine the precise location.

Good birding,

Nate

&gt; Hi Nate,
&gt; Thanks for sharing your day with us, it was very good reading the
&gt; success, as the habitat is so decimated compared with what it was like
&gt; ten years ago before the Maasal started selling of their vegetation to
&gt; unscrupulous charcoal harvesters.
&gt; One bird stood out from your list, where was the Bare-faced Go-Away
&gt; Bird, there is no record closer than Shompole near Natron.
&gt; Very best for now

&gt;&gt; This past Sunday I spent the cloudy morning birding along Magadi Road
&gt;&gt; with Roger Smith and Ben Mugambi.  Birding was steady and good all the
&gt;&gt; way from Corner Baridi down to the Olepolos Cliffs.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; We got started at 7:15 with Yellow-rumped Seedeaters, Grey-backed
&gt;&gt; Camaroptera, African Citril, Common House Martin and Eurasian Swifts.
&gt;&gt; Then came Red-fronted Barbet, Red-faced Crombec and Red-throated Tit
&gt;&gt; in quick succession.  Then we enjoyed watching a female
&gt;&gt; Scarlet-chested Sunbird gathering nesting material and taking it to
&gt;&gt; her nest (photo attached).  Other birds at our first stop included
&gt;&gt; Yellow-breasted Apalis, Nubian Woodpecker, and Absynnian Scimitarbill.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; A short drive downhill brought us to a new group of birds - Variable
&gt;&gt; Sunbird, Fork-tailed Drongo, Pied Wheatear, Yellow-bellied Eremomela,
&gt;&gt; Northern Wheatear, and Singing Cisticola.  We also saw numbers of
&gt;&gt; Swifts and Martins swirling out over the valley - Nyanza Swifts, Palm
&gt;&gt; Swifts, Rock Martins, and Plain Martins.  Other goodies included
&gt;&gt; Holub&#39;s Golden-Weaver, Streaky Seedeaters, Speckled Pigeons, Variable
&gt;&gt; + Bronze Sunbirds, Lyne&#39;s (Wailing) Cisticola, Malachite Sunbird,
&gt;&gt; Green-winged Pytilia, Willow Warbler, Long-tailed Pipit, Red-winged
&gt;&gt; Starling, White-eyed Slaty Flycatcher, Tawny-flanked Prinia and a nice
&gt;&gt; male Scarlet-chested Sunbird.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; A longer drive downhill brought us to yet another suite of birds.  We
&gt;&gt; saw Kenya Rufous Sparrows, Fawn-coloured Lark, Crowned Plovers,
&gt;&gt; Black-billed Weaver, Bare-faced Go-away Bird, Hildebrandt&#39;s Starling,
&gt;&gt; Grey-capped Social Weaver, Chestnut Sparrow, Vitelline Masked Weaver,
&gt;&gt; Beautiful Sunbird, Marico Sunbird, White-bellied Canary, a small
&gt;&gt; gathering of E. Violet-backed Sunbirds, Common Rock-Thrush, and
&gt;&gt; Greater Blue-eared Starling.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Then we drove down to the &#34;first I-cross Road&#34; and turned left into
&gt;&gt; the entrance to the watercourse near the base of the Olepolos Cliffs.
&gt;&gt; A Taita Fiscal watched things from its perch and a pair of Von der
&gt;&gt; Decken&#39;s Hornbills flitted from bush to bush.  Multiple Red-and-yellow
&gt;&gt; Barbets were present on both sides of the dry lugga/watercourse and an
&gt;&gt; African Hoopoe foraged on the ground nearby.  Some other common birds
&gt;&gt; were also present.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Then Ben spotted a distant Martial Eagle soaring - and while scanning
&gt;&gt; the skies further we saw a pair of Verreaux&#39;s Eagles that worked their
&gt;&gt; way closer (photo attached).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Other nice birds present were an immature Red-backed (Turkestan)
&gt;&gt; Shrike, Slate-coloured Boubou, Spotted Morning-Thrush, Rufous-naped
&gt;&gt; Lark, and Little Rock-Thrush.  Then we had a momentary thrill with a
&gt;&gt; Scrub-Robin we thought might be Brown-backed, but when it turned we
&gt;&gt; saw it was a White-Browed.  So it goes.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; At 11am we headed back to Nairobi, happy with the constant birding
&gt;&gt; action along good old Magadi Road.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Good birding,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Nathan Dias
