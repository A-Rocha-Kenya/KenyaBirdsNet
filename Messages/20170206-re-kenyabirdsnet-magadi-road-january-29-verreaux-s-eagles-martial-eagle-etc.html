      <p>Hi Nate,<br>
Thanks for sharing your day with us, it was very good reading the<br>
success, as the habitat is so decimated compared with what it was like<br>
ten years ago before the Maasal started selling of their vegetation to<br>
unscrupulous charcoal harvesters.<br>
One bird stood out from your list, where was the Bare-faced Go-Away<br>
Bird, there is no record closer than Shompole near Natron.<br>
Very best for now<br>
Brian<br>

&gt; This past Sunday I spent the cloudy morning birding along Magadi Road<br>
&gt; with Roger Smith and Ben Mugambi.  Birding was steady and good all the<br>
&gt; way from Corner Baridi down to the Olepolos Cliffs.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; We got started at 7:15 with Yellow-rumped Seedeaters, Grey-backed<br>
&gt; Camaroptera, African Citril, Common House Martin and Eurasian Swifts.<br>
&gt; Then came Red-fronted Barbet, Red-faced Crombec and Red-throated Tit<br>
&gt; in quick succession.  Then we enjoyed watching a female<br>
&gt; Scarlet-chested Sunbird gathering nesting material and taking it to<br>
&gt; her nest (photo attached).  Other birds at our first stop included<br>
&gt; Yellow-breasted Apalis, Nubian Woodpecker, and Absynnian Scimitarbill.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; A short drive downhill brought us to a new group of birds - Variable<br>
&gt; Sunbird, Fork-tailed Drongo, Pied Wheatear, Yellow-bellied Eremomela,<br>
&gt; Northern Wheatear, and Singing Cisticola.  We also saw numbers of<br>
&gt; Swifts and Martins swirling out over the valley - Nyanza Swifts, Palm<br>
&gt; Swifts, Rock Martins, and Plain Martins.  Other goodies included<br>
&gt; Holub&#39;s Golden-Weaver, Streaky Seedeaters, Speckled Pigeons, Variable<br>
&gt; + Bronze Sunbirds, Lyne&#39;s (Wailing) Cisticola, Malachite Sunbird,<br>
&gt; Green-winged Pytilia, Willow Warbler, Long-tailed Pipit, Red-winged<br>
&gt; Starling, White-eyed Slaty Flycatcher, Tawny-flanked Prinia and a nice<br>
&gt; male Scarlet-chested Sunbird.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; A longer drive downhill brought us to yet another suite of birds.  We<br>
&gt; saw Kenya Rufous Sparrows, Fawn-coloured Lark, Crowned Plovers,<br>
&gt; Black-billed Weaver, Bare-faced Go-away Bird, Hildebrandt&#39;s Starling,<br>
&gt; Grey-capped Social Weaver, Chestnut Sparrow, Vitelline Masked Weaver,<br>
&gt; Beautiful Sunbird, Marico Sunbird, White-bellied Canary, a small<br>
&gt; gathering of E. Violet-backed Sunbirds, Common Rock-Thrush, and<br>
&gt; Greater Blue-eared Starling.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Then we drove down to the &quot;first I-cross Road&quot; and turned left into<br>
&gt; the entrance to the watercourse near the base of the Olepolos Cliffs.<br>
&gt; A Taita Fiscal watched things from its perch and a pair of Von der<br>
&gt; Decken&#39;s Hornbills flitted from bush to bush.  Multiple Red-and-yellow<br>
&gt; Barbets were present on both sides of the dry lugga/watercourse and an<br>
&gt; African Hoopoe foraged on the ground nearby.  Some other common birds<br>
&gt; were also present.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Then Ben spotted a distant Martial Eagle soaring - and while scanning<br>
&gt; the skies further we saw a pair of Verreaux&#39;s Eagles that worked their<br>
&gt; way closer (photo attached).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Other nice birds present were an immature Red-backed (Turkestan)<br>
&gt; Shrike, Slate-coloured Boubou, Spotted Morning-Thrush, Rufous-naped<br>
&gt; Lark, and Little Rock-Thrush.  Then we had a momentary thrill with a<br>
&gt; Scrub-Robin we thought might be Brown-backed, but when it turned we<br>
&gt; saw it was a White-Browed.  So it goes.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; At 11am we headed back to Nairobi, happy with the constant birding<br>
&gt; action along good old Magadi Road.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Good birding,<br>
&gt;<br>
