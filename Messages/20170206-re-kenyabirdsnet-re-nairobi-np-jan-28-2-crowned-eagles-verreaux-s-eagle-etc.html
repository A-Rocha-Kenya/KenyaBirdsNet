  <div dir="ltr">Thank you for this update Nate. Very exciting to hear about the Verreaux&#39;s Eagle. There is a resident pair at Lukenya Hill so I wonder if this is one of the birds from that pair or if it is a completely different individual. Will be interesting to see if it sticks around and whether it is alone or has a mate.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Sidney</div><div class="gmail_extra"><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Fri, Feb 3, 2017 at 4:33 PM, Nate Dias <a href="mailto:offshorebirder@gmail.com">offshorebirder@gmail.com</a> [kenyabirdsnet] <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:kenyabirdsnet-noreply@yahoogroups.com" target="_blank">kenyabirdsnet-noreply@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex">

I enjoyed a good day&#39;s birding around Nairobi NP this past Sunday with<br>
Roger Smith and Ben Mugambi.  We ended with 118 bird species, due to<br>
concentrating on mammals (particularly Suni and Rhino) in addition to<br>
just birds.  Leaving the East Gate just before 6pm, we had an issue<br>
with &quot;staff abandoning their gate post early&quot; which I will comment on<br>
later.<br>
<br>
A highlight of the day was a pair of Crowned Eagles over the forest<br>
not far from Nairobi Tented Camp.  We went from Suni sighting to<br>
sighting (18 individuals!) after making the left hand turn below<br>
Nagalomon Dam.  Just after crossing the Kisimbe River (west of Nairobi<br>
Tented Camp), I heard a familiar manic whistling call (and hoped it<br>
was not a clever mimic).   Then Ben spotted a single adult Crowned<br>
Eagle circling high that quickly soared behind the treeline.  We drove<br>
forward a bit to an opening where we could look back towards the eagle<br>
location and saw two adult Crowned Eagles soaring together.  One did a<br>
diving display a couple of times.  It was noteworthy that all Suni<br>
immediately disappeared after we first heard the Crowned Eagle<br>
vocalizing; we did not have another Suni sighting afterwards.<br>
<br>
We also had a Verreaux&#39;s Eagle perched and then in flight in the<br>
Mokoyet Valley not far from the Emakoko.<br>
<br>
It was also nice to see a pair of Black Rhino out in the open - exact<br>
location undisclosed for reasons of tradecraft.<br>
<br>
We started the morning entering the East Gate, since the line was<br>
already pretty long at the main gate at 6:45am.  From the picnic area<br>
just inside the gate, we enjoyed watching around 3 dozen Little<br>
Swifts, 1/3 that many Palm Swifts, a couple of Scarce Swifts and a<br>
handful of Barn Swallows.  Might have been a White-rumped Swift or two<br>
mixed in, but it was hard to tell.  We did not see any Mottled or<br>
Pallid type Swifts to try and photograph, as per Brian&#39;s recent<br>
request.  Also present were Red-billed Quelea, Rufous Sparrow, Common<br>
Fiscal, Superb Starling and other common + expected birds.<br>
<br>
A puffed-up Kori Bustard was just south of the East Gate, and the dam<br>
not far to the west (Eland Dam?) held some waterbirds and shorebirds.<br>
A pair of Red-billed Teal kept trying to sleep through the racket of a<br>
pair of Coke&#39;s Hartebeest butting horns in earnest.  The water&#39;s edge<br>
held an African Jacana, a few Blacksmith Lapwings, a Three-banded<br>
Plover, 2 Wood Sandpipers, and a Little Stint.  Driving away from the<br>
dam, we had a covey of five Shelley&#39;s Francolins.<br>
<br>
Hyena Dam held 12 Long-toed Lapwings, 10 Blacksmith Lapwings, 6<br>
Spur-winged Lapwings, and a couple of Three-banded Plovers.  Other<br>
shorebirds included three Common Snipe, 9 Black-winged Stilt, 4 Wood<br>
Sandpipers, and half a dozen Little Stint.  We did not see any African<br>
Water Rails but four Black Crakes walked and flew around brazenly.<br>
One of the Marabou Storks present kept washing part of a blue plastic<br>
shopping bag and trying to swallow it.  Another had a broken foot that<br>
others pecked and pulled.  We later saw the same bird around 5:30pm<br>
preparing to roost with lots of other storks beside Athi Dam.  Other<br>
birds present at Hyena Dam included a pair of Crowned Cranes.  A<br>
drying-up boggy patch nearby held a  Green Sandpiper and a couple of<br>
Common Snipe.<br>
<br>
We made our way to Nagalomon Dam, which was pretty quiet birdwise<br>
except for a pair of Lesser Swamp Warblers, a White-headed Barbet and<br>
a Malachite Kingfisher.  But we did see a young male Lion chase a herd<br>
of Impala on the far side of the dam.<br>
<br>
In general it was hard to find much Typha or reeds around dams -<br>
presumably due to drying conditions and hungry Buffalo.<br>
<br>
After the Suni and Crowned Eagle encounters (poor photo of an Eagle<br>
attached), we enjoyed good birding at the Kingfisher Picnic site.  A<br>
couple of African Moustached Warblers were working out their<br>
territorial boundaries and one sat up and sang fairly out in the open<br>
(photo attached).   Two Brown Parisomas fed actively and although they<br>
did not mind us, presented a challenging target to photograph.  A pair<br>
of Red-throated Tits foraged and scolded nearby birds and mammals.<br>
There was also a pair of Chin-spot Batis, Scarlet-chested Sunbirds,<br>
the requisite Striped Kingfisher and Red-cheeked Cordon Bleus.<br>
<br>
At 5pm the Athi Basin had Fawn-coloured Lark, Yellow-necked Spurfowl,<br>
and Pangani Longclaw.  Athi Dam and the surrounding area had hordes of<br>
Marabou Storks, with a few Yellow-billed Storks, a Black Stork, a<br>
handful of White Storks and some Cattle Egrets.  A lone White-faced<br>
Whistling-Duck was present among Egyptian Geese and shorebirds<br>
included a Ruff, Kittlitz&#39;s Plover, Spur-winged Lapwing, Blacksmith<br>
Lapwing, Little Stint, Common Sandpiper and Wood Sandpiper.   The<br>
shoreline also held a small flock of Fischer&#39;s Sparrow-Larks.<br>
<br>
It was a drag to see the SGR monstrosity looming near Athi dam and<br>
earlier along the southern region of the park we saw what seemed to be<br>
cattle grazing inside the park well across the Mbagathi River.<br>
<br>
When we attempted to check out of the east gate at 5:59pm, we were<br>
told the gate attendant / customer service representative had already<br>
left.  They were supposed to be present until 6:30pm.  Due to a dinner<br>
engagement I had at 7, we did not have time to go round to check out<br>
of the main gate.  This meant Ben had to return another day to get<br>
officially checked out.  When we stopped by the Langata gate the next<br>
morning just before 7am on our way to Corner Baridi, it was still<br>
closed with no staff in sight.  Not unexpected given all Brian&#39;s posts<br>
about that gate attendant chronically showing up late for work.<br>
<br>
It is surprising how little staff accountability exists at the park<br>
where KWS headquarters is located!<br>
<br>
This, plus the recent news that National Parks will no longer accept<br>
cash for admission (M-pesa only), put a bit of a damper on things.<br>
<br>
Good birding,<br>
<br>
