Hello Birders<br>
<br>
They always say that birding is the best addiction without a vice and therefore the addiction of ticking a new species on your list is the excitement that make you want to do more and more.<br>
<br>
On 15th this Month at Taita hill wildlife Sanctuary which is a privately own, but in the same&nbsp; Ecosystem with Tsavo West, Tsavo East and Mkomazi G Reserve in Tanzania. Migration of Birds both Palearctic and Intra-African can give suprises of new birds. To me Counting birds like Northern Carmine Bee-eaters that kept following anything from Babbons, Secretary bird, Abdim's storks to Elephants as long as they are foraging on the ground....was like a thriller. The good combination of its colours and the dependency on others kept my binoculars glued to them longer. The Blue-cheeked bee eaters waited on elevated point to catch any flying bees.<br>
Off-course they did appear on both places. Other Bee-eaters at Tsavo East Aruba lodge&nbsp; areas were White-throated and Little bee-Eaters . Then at an open area near the wind mill the&nbsp; flocks of Chestnut-backed and chesnut-headed Sparrow Lark were on the ground busy filling their crops.<br>
<br>
Other birds that were exitings were like the&nbsp; Black headed lapwing, Abdim's Stock. Eastern olivaceous warbler, Rufous bush chat, Eurasian Roller, Steppe Eagle, Lesser and Greater Kestrel at Salt lick, Western Marsh Harrier, other Harriers that i couldn't&nbsp; be able to differenciate like Pallid and Montagu's either or one of them was there too,&nbsp; Lanner Falcon and many other birds<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Wishing you a good luck birding<br>
<br>
George.<br>
