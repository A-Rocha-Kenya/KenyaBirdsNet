  <pre>Hi Colin,
Congratulations for not seeing a House Crow! The oxbow sounds
incredible and I hope you get time for many follow-up visits before it
dries.
Can you tell me anything about the Red-faced Crombecs you saw?
Best for now
Brian

&gt; A week ago we did a waterbird count at a new site for me - a large oxbox
&gt; lake north of the Sabaki and upstream that I&#39;d seen often from the plane
&gt; when landing at Malindi. Amazingly, despite the drought it was pretty
&gt; full of water - where everywhere else is dry. One of the wazee we talked
&gt; to there said the water comes in when the Sabaki is in flood - though i
&gt; couldn&#39;t think that it had had very high water levels during the past
&gt; few months though perhaps it did in December?
&gt;
&gt; With the water there, it was very busy with water birds and given the
&gt; area we didn&#39;t manage to cover, I&#39;d estimate a good 1,000 Reed
&gt; Cormorant, 300-400 Glossy Ibis and 100-150 herons of various sorts. Also
&gt; a flock of 11 Northern Pintail - my first for the coast in over 10 years
&gt; - and about 15 Pygmy Geese - again they&#39;ve been hard to find in recent
&gt; years here.
&gt;
&gt; Of other particular interest were:
&gt;
&gt; Jameson&#39;s Firefinch - a pair in scrub along the road in the same atlas
&gt; square (pentad).
&gt; Upcher&#39;s Warbler - there were a surprising number of larger acacia trees
&gt; there which have not (yet) been removed for charcoal and one in
&gt; particular was quite busy with birds - the Upcher&#39;s as well as a pair of
&gt; Red-faced Crombec.
&gt; Little Rush Warbler - singing in the reeds, heard several times - the
&gt; lower and slower song of the more southern birds, not the one our
&gt; highland birds have.
&gt; Rufous Bush Chat / Scrub Robin - we had at least 12 of these in the one
&gt; pentad. This year they have been extremely numerous and obvious along
&gt; the north coast here.
&gt;
&gt; We had a tight window of time so were not able to spend as much time or
&gt; go as far as we&#39;d have liked, but it was an awesome spot and worth
&gt; exploring further.
&gt;
&gt; Species list for the pentad hit 87 species with some surprising gaps
&gt; such as House Crow... yes, we spent some serious effort searching for
&gt; House Crows and didn&#39;t find them! Same for House Sparrow - searched the
&gt; small villages we drove though to no avail.
&gt;
&gt; Last bird of the pentad was a pair of Pangani Longclaws right by the
&gt; road taking shelter from the heat under a bush. Had a Golden Pipit in
&gt; the same pentad two weeks earlier when on the way through to Marafa but
&gt; he didn&#39;t show that morning.
