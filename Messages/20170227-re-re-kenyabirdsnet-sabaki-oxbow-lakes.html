  <pre>Hi Colin,
It must be minima, maybe a shade paler than loringi from here, but
pretty much the same as Tsavo West loringi. Makes you wonder why your
bird is called a Red-faced Crombec doesn&#39;t it!? Whilst on Tsavo West,
when you have caught RFC at Ngulia are they all pallid like this. I
have only ever been there for one and it was thought Somali, but now I
understand the error of our ways! You cannot trust a record of Somali
from Tsavo West.
Thanks for following up on this,
Cheers for now
Brian

&gt; Hi Brian,
&gt; Followed the crombec as was keen to see it well. Confirmed all uniform
&gt; pinkish underparts and no supercilium. A pair of them foraging. Raf, a
&gt; visiting birder with me, managed to get the attached photo of one of them.
&gt; Yes... Red-faced surprised me. I guess it must be minima ? I&#39;ve seen
&gt; crombecs once before in Dakatcha a few years ago dime way north of Adu but
&gt; not well enough to confirm which one. Nice to have a photo of these ones...

&gt; Hi Colin,
&gt;
&gt; Congratulations for not seeing a House Crow! The oxbow sounds
&gt;
&gt; incredible and I hope you get time for many follow-up visits before it
&gt;
&gt; dries.
&gt;
&gt; Can you tell me anything about the Red-faced Crombecs you saw?
&gt;
&gt; Best for now
&gt;

&gt;&gt; A week ago we did a waterbird count at a new site for me - a large oxbox
&gt;
&gt;&gt; lake north of the Sabaki and upstream that I&#39;d seen often from the plane
&gt;
&gt;&gt; when landing at Malindi. Amazingly, despite the drought it was pretty
&gt;
&gt;&gt; full of water - where everywhere else is dry. One of the wazee we talked
&gt;
&gt;&gt; to there said the water comes in when the Sabaki is in flood - though i
&gt;
&gt;&gt; couldn&#39;t think that it had had very high water levels during the past
&gt;
&gt;&gt; few months though perhaps it did in December?
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; With the water there, it was very busy with water birds and given the
&gt;
&gt;&gt; area we didn&#39;t manage to cover, I&#39;d estimate a good 1,000 Reed
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Cormorant, 300-400 Glossy Ibis and 100-150 herons of various sorts. Also
&gt;
&gt;&gt; a flock of 11 Northern Pintail - my first for the coast in over 10 years
&gt;
&gt;&gt; - and about 15 Pygmy Geese - again they&#39;ve been hard to find in recent
&gt;
&gt;&gt; years here.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Of other particular interest were:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Jameson&#39;s Firefinch - a pair in scrub along the road in the same atlas
&gt;
&gt;&gt; square (pentad).
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Upcher&#39;s Warbler - there were a surprising number of larger acacia trees
&gt;
&gt;&gt; there which have not (yet) been removed for charcoal and one in
&gt;
&gt;&gt; particular was quite busy with birds - the Upcher&#39;s as well as a pair of
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Red-faced Crombec.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Little Rush Warbler - singing in the reeds, heard several times - the
&gt;
&gt;&gt; lower and slower song of the more southern birds, not the one our
&gt;
&gt;&gt; highland birds have.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Rufous Bush Chat / Scrub Robin - we had at least 12 of these in the one
&gt;
&gt;&gt; pentad. This year they have been extremely numerous and obvious along
&gt;
&gt;&gt; the north coast here.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; We had a tight window of time so were not able to spend as much time or
&gt;
&gt;&gt; go as far as we&#39;d have liked, but it was an awesome spot and worth
&gt;
&gt;&gt; exploring further.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Species list for the pentad hit 87 species with some surprising gaps
&gt;
&gt;&gt; such as House Crow... yes, we spent some serious effort searching for
&gt;
&gt;&gt; House Crows and didn&#39;t find them! Same for House Sparrow - searched the
&gt;
&gt;&gt; small villages we drove though to no avail.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Last bird of the pentad was a pair of Pangani Longclaws right by the
&gt;
&gt;&gt; road taking shelter from the heat under a bush. Had a Golden Pipit in
&gt;
&gt;&gt; the same pentad two weeks earlier when on the way through to Marafa but
&gt;
&gt;&gt; he didn&#39;t show that morning.
