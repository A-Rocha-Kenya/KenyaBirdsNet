  <pre>Dear All,
I was going through bird photos with a friend from Burgeret,
identifying the species taken in his garden. It was pretty
straightforward with Greater-Blue-eared and Superb Starlings, Hadada,
Verreauxâ€™s Eagle-Owl, Harrier Hawk, Red-cheeked Cordon-bleu etc, and
now the next one. I looked at the image and thought this is all wrong.
I would like to hear opinions of this bird, I have some suggestions
but it is not positively identified. The birds that it most resembles
have just one race of each species throughout the country, so it is
not just a case of a race with which I am not familiar.
Best to all
Brian
