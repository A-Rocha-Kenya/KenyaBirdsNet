  <pre>Dear All;   Concerning Kenya historical records there is no better 
place to check than the 1977-96 Scopus Annual Reports that contain 
30,000+ fully substantiated and verified Kenya records.  Another 
excellent source of Kenya records is the 1989 Bird Atlas of Kenya 
that contained details of the entire 20,000+ collection of Kenya 
specimens held in the National Museum, plus all Kenya records 
published in the EA Natural History Society Bulletin and Journal, 
also Scopus 1977-86, together with historical data from the vast 
collections of VGL Van Someren and Sir Frederick Jackson.

e-bird, itself somewhat of a novelty, contains lists of totally 
UNSUBSTANTIATED records.

With best wishes
Don Turner
