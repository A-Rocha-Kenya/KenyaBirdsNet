  <div dir="ltr">Hi Simon,<br><br>Thanks for the feedback. The Golden-winged Sunbird doesn&#39;t really surprise me but I find it quite interesting that the Beautiful Sunbird is regular in Kabete at this time of year. I though it would probably be more regular in lower parts of Nairobi and only come this high in drought years. I&#39;ll be much more keen on sunbirds in the area from now on.<br><br>Someone mentioned not too long ago that there is an effort or suggestion to merge eBird, Kenya Bird Map and other atlas projects. Not sure how far that has gone but it would definitely be great to have them merged.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Sidney</div><div class="gmail_extra"><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Thu, Mar 9, 2017 at 9:48 AM, Simon Carter <a href="mailto:simonchiz@gmail.com">simonchiz@gmail.com</a> [kenyabirdsnet] <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:kenyabirdsnet-noreply@yahoogroups.com" target="_blank">kenyabirdsnet-noreply@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex">

      <p></p><div dir="ltr">Hi Sidney,<div><br></div><div>Great to learn that you found the Hinde&#39;s Babblers on the University farm again  (I should note for the record that the date of our sighting reported to this list was incorrect, it was actually Sunday Feb 26th).  A some wonderful other species on your list, very nice that you found an Irania there. </div><div><br></div><div>I had a female Golden-winged sunbird in my yard off Lower Kabete later in the day on Feb 26th, came in to one of our birdbaths to drink.  I have seen them regularly from April through June on the Farm but this was the earliest I have recorded.  James Bradley tells me that his research shows regular presence in the Nairobi area from Feb through June/July.  </div><div><br></div><div>A male Beautiful Sunbird has shown up regularly the last two years in a Fever Tree neighbouring my yard, and assuming it is the same individual, appeared again this Sunday March 5th for the first time this year.   Again, James&#39; research and eBird records show regular occurrence in the area during the first 2-3 months of the year.   </div><div><br></div><div>I seems to me as a relative newcomer to this list that the eBird resource is woefully underused by Kenyan birders.  It&#39;s free to sign up and very easy to search for historical records  If offered Titus/Peter at Nature Kenya to provide an introduction to it to anyone interested in learning how to use it.  I don&#39;t want to get into pros and cons of different databases and tools, which I believe comes down to personal preferences, but if the eBird data could somehow be made available to the Kenya Bird Atlas project, and vice versa, we would have a set of incredibly powerful tools available to birders of all levels of experience.  </div><div><br></div><div>Best to all,</div><div><br></div><div>Simon</div></div>
