  <pre>Hi Jamie,
I have never heard of a SCF on the Mountain itself, but Tom, Nigel and
myself had one on Lolldaiga Nov 2015. They are very nice, was it an
adult male? Also Washington had one at Ngong Forest a week ago,
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Dear All,
&gt;
&gt; I spent the weekend up at Ragati and really enjoyed birding the forest
&gt; around their new log cabin. Below are some of the species that I saw.
&gt;
&gt; Something that seemed out of place was the Semi-collared Flycatcher that we
&gt; spotted beside the camping area. It was low to the ground and very
&gt; cooperative. Has this species been seen on the mountain before? I can see
&gt; in the Stevenson range map a few x s east of its normal range but can&#39;t
&gt; tell from where these observations might have been made.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, Jamie Christian
