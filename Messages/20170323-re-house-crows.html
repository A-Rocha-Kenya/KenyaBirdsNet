  <pre>The huge increases that we are seeing in House Crows is directly 
related to the increase in uncollected garbage that litter so many of 
our coastal towns.  In addition to the control efforts already 
underway, surely an equal amount of effort should go into getting the 
local councils to re-install a proper refuge collection unit, that 
would go a long way in reducing crow numbers. Just look back to the 
times when these councils did have efficient garbage disposal teams 
(not that long ago) and compare crow number then to what they are 
today.
