  <pre>Dear All,
I have just heard that there has been a successful scientific
expedition to the unexplored and neglected Pacific island of Trumpsa.
As the full details are not out yet, I cannot testify as to the
reliability of the claims, but the group consisting of Ornithologists,
Mammologists, Herpetologists, Lepidopterists, and Pisciologists have
all found an unexpected number of hitherto unknown species to science.
They have all named their finds after the Island on which they
discovered it.

Amongst the birds they are busily describing; Trumpsa Fowl, Trumpsa
Turkey, Trumpsa Loon, Trumpsa Cuckoo, Trumpsa Bustard, Trumpsa Booby,
Trumpsa Dikkop, Trumpsa Red-necked Buzzard, Trumpsa Galah, Trumpsa
Pygmy Tyrant, Trumpsa Lyre Bird, Trumpsa Bristlehead, Trumpsa Drongo,
Trumpsa (In)Sultan Tit,  Trumpsa Great Tit, Trumpsa Spiny Babbler and
finally Trumpsa Twite.

The preparation for the naming of the new Mammals etc., are expected
to be of similar interest. For instance they have discovered a new
Baboon, Pig, Hippo Dik-dik and many more.

Best to all
Brian
