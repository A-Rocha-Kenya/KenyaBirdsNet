  <pre>NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 30th APRIL &amp; 1st MAY 2017

Dear All,
I visited Nairobi National Park on two consecutive days, visiting the
same areas, but the differences in the birds recorded were quite
remarkable. The period leading up to the 30th had been fairly stable
weather although the odd shower, but the night of 30th there was a
change and the climate became very unsettled with many showers of
which some were heavy, and impressive skies all around. Whilst the
Sunday was a cloudy start, most of the day was quite sunny and no
rain, but the following day was a drizzly start, with many showers
during the day and the only sun was whilst we had a walk at Hippo
Pools, which had received quite a negligible amount of rain compared
to the north of the Park.

On 30th, James Kashangaki was the kind driver who conveyed returning
Mike Davidson, Selma Wyatt and two of her friends and myself around
NNP in a clockwise direction. On 1st, Nigel Hunter provided transport
for Jennifer Oduori and myself and we followed an anti-clockwise
direction.

So that there is not too much repetition, the report will trace May
1st, and where interesting observations were made the previous day
only, the further records will be in brackets.

The first place visited was Ivory Burning Site, there were many
excited residents singing as we drove in, the only species of note
though were the first of twenty Willow Warblers and Zanzibar Sombre
Greenbul. But the only White-bellied Bustard was calling from the
plains.
(Four Garden Warblers).

Nothing on the Nagalomon Drift, although White-rumped Swifts and
Lesser Striped Swallows were back on breeding territories on the
bridge and there was a sprinkling of more Willow Warblers.
On the Dam were eight Darters, Cattle Egrets were fairly widespread
today but the first dead dangling bird held by sisal (or similar) was
sickeningly hanging from the tree on the island, the first away from
the Cattle Egret open-air cemetery at Athi Dam, a single Great Egret,
five African Spoonbill, Sacred Ibis back resting on their nesting
platforms, three White-faced Whistling-Ducks and an African Jacana on
the sand bar, but no palearctic waders present, on passing by in the
afternoon there were two Wire-tailed Swallows.
A conservative forty cars were present to admire an extravert lioness
lying in the open at the end of the causeway staging for an immediate
exciting start for people immediately on entering the Park.
(Three Black-crowned Night-Herons, single Jacobin and Levaillant’s
Cuckoo in the same bush).

Taking the back road towards Hyena Dam again not much activity,
although small numbers of Red-collared, Jackson’s and White-winged
Widowbirds all in breeding plumage, numerous Red-billed Quelea and the
days only Garden Warbler. Whilst at Hyena Dam there were three Glossy
Ibis, three African Spoonbills, a pair of Grey Crowned Cranes, a pair
of Red-billed Teal, pair of adult Fish Eagles, three African Jacanas,
ten Long-toed and four Spur-winged Plovers apart from usual Blacksmith
and Three-banded, but the only migrant waders remaining here were
fifteen Black-winged Stilts, and four each of Ruff and Wood
Sandpipers. A late surprise was a dense flock of 42 Eurasian
Bee-eaters heading eastwards without stopping but it looks like this
rise in the water level has sealed the fate for the extremely
persistent pair of African Water Rails and they have finally departed.
(Little Stint, Sand Martin, Wire-tailed Swallow pair).

We returned towards the Mokoyeti with the first of sixteen Red-backed
Shrikes and first two of six Lesser Grey Shrikes for the day, it was
noteworthy that all but two of each species were confined in the north
of the Park. There was another Wood Sandpiper at the ford, a female
Saddle-billed Stork in the swamp, we then circled back across the
bridge and back towards Nagalomon Dam. Here we watched a pair of
Red-rumped Swallows gathering mud for their nest, and on stopping for
a shrike, had an adult Sooty Falcon come right over us, and an
extremely handsome adult Great Spotted Cuckoo in some attractively
flowering Carissa. Then along the lower road and out to Kingfisher
Picnic Site where there was a sudden heavy shower. As we left there
was an emergence of flying ants around the top of one acacia and this
was attracting a number of falcons and one Eurasian Roller. We stopped
and watched the spectacle, and were very happy and very amazed to see
it was not just one species but a mixed species flock. By
photographing the birds present it was possible to see individual
variations, (see images). Pride of place went to four Western
Red-footed Falcons, and two Sooty Falcons. With them were three
female-plumaged Amur Falcons and a single Eurasian Hobby. Later they
were joined by six Lesser Kestrels. It seemed that most of these birds
were not in breeding plumage and still in moult, and may not breed in
the coming season which might explain their lateness.
(Bateleur).

Heading in the direction of Baboon Cliffs we had four Eurasian
Rollers, and with two more trios near Athi Dam later, brought the
total to eleven for the day. This suggests a surprisingly late but
considerable movement through the country the previous night. The only
other species of note along this stretch was a very pale Tawny Eagle.
The first of merely four Barn Swallows seen today. An adult Martial
Eagle was at the cliffs, and the immature long-crested immature
Martial Eagle was along the river before the climb back up to the main
road to Hippo Pools, that was seen a couple of months ago at the same
site.

We had a walk at Hippo Pools, yet again quiet but an immature and an
adult Striated Heron were nice with the adult in full breeding plumage
and very bright. Then continued to Rhino Circuit for lunch. Initially
quiet we, we eventually found a feeding group with five Violet
Wood-hoopoes, and the more usual species of the dry woodlands. Now
heading towards the pipeline, we crossed it and continued along
towards the railway line. Picking up Laughing Dove, Banded Parisoma
and Lesser Masked Weaver.
(Namaqua Dove, Common Whitethroat, Speckle-fronted Weaver).

Athi Dam as expected was quiet, and the shoreline looked quite empty,
there was an adult Black-crowned Night-Heron roosting on the Causeway,
a soiled White Stork, several African Spoonbills, a very tame but
nevertheless healthy Ruppell’s Vulture which had been drinking from
the dam, an adult Fish Eagle, four Black-winged Stilt, single Ringed
Plover, Little Stint, Common Greenshank and Common Sandpiper made up
the migrant waders, and at least ten Spur-winged Plover were present.
(Three Black-crowned Night-Herons, two Ringed and one Kittlitz’s
Plover, three Common Sandpipers).

Now heading back northwards we crossed the grassland with little
activity although singing Zitting was the ninth species of Cisticola
for the day, there was one Rosy-breasted Longclaw and two pairs of
Grey Crowned Cranes.
(Two displaying male Hartlaub’s Bustards, Lappet-faced Vulture, five
separate Black-shouldered Kites).

Then across to the nearly gone Eland Hollow Dam, where there was no
reward today!
But leaving here we found the days only Secretarybird.
(Pair Grey-crowned Cranes, Saddle-billed Stork).

Returning for a final coffee at Hyena Dam there was now an adult
pinking-up Yellow-billed Stork and sitting on a Balanites next to the
causeway, an adult Martial Eagle feeding on a fairly large but too far
consumed waterbird. (See image), and the days only Banded Martin. The
forest was quiet as we passed through, and the Forest Edge Dam has
dried up, whilst all Langata Dam could muster was a Great Egret.

We were through Langata Gate at 5.30pm.

On both of the mornings on arriving at Main Gate, the car park was
nearly full, and there were hundreds of people waiting to enter the
Park. On the Monday we had to join a queue that extended out of the
office and into the office car park, a sight I had never seen before.
Most of the people going into the Park are student Boras from the just
opened University on Kisembe Estate. Now as daunting as this might
sound, it isn’t! Some enterprising tourism organisation is organising
trips to the Park for the students who are pleasant and polite. Their
tour leaders are putting them all on their own MPesa charge, but as
residents they have to show their ID for their lower rates, hence they
also have to queue so the image on the card can be matched with the
individual. So their process in spite of the volume is speedy and the
KWS Staff are doing a great job at handling this and we were in the
Park much quicker than we had anticipated when we first arrived and
saw the masses. This would have been a disaster if in fact we were
still using the previous smart cards.

Mammals were abounding. A total of seven White and a Black Rhino,
plenty of Lions (at least on 1st), numerous plains game with major
incursions of Zebra and Eland, and Wildebeest in small groups over the
entire Park although no major concentrations. Best mammal was on 1st,
with a Grey Duiker on the road towards Langata Gate.
Although we did not have a great migrant presence to boost the totals,
on Monday 1st we left with an impressive 185 species, the most amazing
miss being Red-billed Firefinch! This was not ever thought possible!!
So we achieved the impossible!!! The previous day there were
substantial species unique to that days outing.

Best to all

KEY TO THE MONTAGE (three different sizes of the same to chose from)

1-3 RED-FOOTED FALCON
Note the tatty tail on this individual, this is nearly a full adult male.

4-6 RED-FOOTED FALCON
Note the clean tail and plumage of this adult male.

7 SOOTY FALCON
Presumed first year bird changing towards grey of adults.
Note greyish cere, bright yellow feet and eye-ring. Also the whitish
tipping to tail with central tail feathers obviously longer.

8 NORTHERN HOBBY (?)
The only image of this bird, all grey above though with rusty tail
that lacks terminal band.
Maybe a first summer bird.

9 RED-FOOTED FALCON
This is the strangest of plumages, an adult male that is retaining
immature head pattern.

10 AMUR FALCON
An immature bird lacking any male characters, probable young female.

11 AMUR FALCON
This might be adult female or the underside of 10

12 AMUR FALCON
Again possibly the same individual as 10 &amp; 11

13 RED-FOOTED FALCON
Note the pallid plumage of this first year male, which already shows
the diagnostic white wing flash of fully adult males.

14 AMUR FALCON
Probably a different individual female to 10-12

15 NORTHERN HOBBY
Adult-looking bird about to grab a miniscule insect with its feet!

16 SOOTY FALCON
This near adult could conceivably be changing-adult 7, seen from below
but the image suggests a different bird which shows how images in the
field can deceive.

17 &amp; 18 FALCON SP.
This is a problem bird, the all dark underparts contrasting
dramatically with the pale cheeks and smooth transition from dark
moustachial streaks to light face suggest Eleonora’s, as do the
blackish underwing coverts. It’s very dark above as well. I think it
requires a bit more research on this heavily moulting bird.
Conceivably Sooty would go through a similar stage, but I should not
be so dark above, what do people think?

19 NORTHERN HOBBY
Adult-looking with fresh plumage.

20 GREAT SPOTTED CUCKOO
A very uncommon visitor to the Park, this beautiful adult was between
the lower Mokoyeti Bridge and Nagalomon Dam.

21 PIED KINGFISHER
A bit of aggression at Hippo Pools.

22 MARTIAL EAGLE
Adult feeding on unidentified waterbird at Hyena Dam.

23 VIOLET WOOD-HOOPOE
One of five birds in bad light on Rhino Circuit.

24 LITTLE STINT
Coming into breeding plumage at Hyena Dam.

25 RED-CAPPED LARK
Adult in nuptial swagger after the rain.

26 &amp; 27 LESSER GREY SHRIKES
Two very different looking birds, just in case you think they all look the same!

28 COMMON GREENSHANK
Acquiring breeding plumage at Athi Dam.

29 RED-BACKED SHRIKE
Bright spring female.

30 RED-RUMPED SWALLOW
Mud-gathering for nest.

31 EURASIAN ROLLER
Eleven in the Park today is a very high number at any time let alone May.
