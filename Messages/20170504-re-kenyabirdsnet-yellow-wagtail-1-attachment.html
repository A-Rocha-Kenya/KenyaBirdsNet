  <pre>Hi Jez,
In all likelihood yes, but I am just wondering if it could be a first
year male feldegg coming into breeding condition, although there is no
sign of any black feathering. Even a thunbergi should be showing black
on the ear coverts now. What did it look like a week later?!
Best for now
Brian
