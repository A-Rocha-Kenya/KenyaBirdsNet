  <pre>Good news and bad news on the bird front:

On World Migratory Bird Day, May 10, Nature Kenya&#39;s Wednesday Morning
Birdwalk saw a migratory bird Â­ although most of the northern migrants have
left. It was a Sedge Warbler, feeding on the ground near a marsh in Karura
Forest. Thanks to Friends of Karura Forest for a terrific bird walk, with
over 55 species in two and a half hours.

Today May 11, however, a report from Brian Finch of a House Crow in Emali.
With the proliferation of human habitation along the road and railway line
between Mombasa and Nairobi, House Crows may find suitable habitats.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
