  <div dir="ltr">Dear all,<div><br></div><div>A quick update on the Hinde&#39;s Babblers at the University of Nairobi&#39;s Upper Kabete field station. This week I have observed 5 individuals - 4 adults, 1 juvenile. This marks the first breeding record for Hinde&#39;s Babbler in Nairobi. Another interesting observation was a White-browed Coucal getting close to the babblers and being promptly driven away. I guess it is a brood parasite (or a potential one) for the babblers, as they are of a fairly similar size. See photos attached, though not high quality.<br><br>Best regards,<br>Sidney</div></div>
