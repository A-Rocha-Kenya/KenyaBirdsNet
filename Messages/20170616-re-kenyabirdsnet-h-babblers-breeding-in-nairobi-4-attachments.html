  <pre>Really well done Sidney, such good news.
The Coucal is not a brood parasite though, but a potential predator,
Best for now

&gt; Dear all,
&gt;
&gt; A quick update on the Hinde&#39;s Babblers at the University of Nairobi&#39;s Upper
&gt; Kabete field station. This week I have observed 5 individuals - 4 adults, 1
&gt; juvenile. This marks the first breeding record for Hinde&#39;s Babbler in
&gt; Nairobi. Another interesting observation was a White-browed Coucal getting
&gt; close to the babblers and being promptly driven away. I guess it is a brood
&gt; parasite (or a potential one) for the babblers, as they are of a fairly
&gt; similar size. See photos attached, though not high quality.
&gt;
&gt; Best regards,
