  <pre>Greetings birders

The coastal strip received some rain, and Dakatcha Woodland Important Bird
Area is green and filled with flowers, butterflies and dragonflies. Some
seasonal wetlands are covered in sedges or blue and white waterlilies.
Others are dry or drying rapidly.

A visit by a National Museums of Kenya team at the end of June recorded all
three globally Endangered bird species: Sokoke Scops Owl, Clarke&#39;s Weaver
and Sokoke Pipit. 

By the time we got there in early July, the Clarke&#39;s Weavers had
disappeared. I suspect that they nested in May, and the flocks seen in June
probably included immatures. Some highlights from our July 5-10 visit:

Waterbirds in seasonal Lake Roka in the southwest of Dakatcha IBA: Lesser
Moorhen, together with Common Moorhen, Black Crake, and a brown bird that
might have been an immature Allen&#39;s Gallinule. Also Saddle-billed and
Woolly-necked storks.

Breeding records of Retz&#39;s Helmetshrike on the nest, Chestnut-fronted
Helmetshrike feeding begging juvenile, and immature Madagascar Bee-eaters
with adults.

Thanks to Nature Kenya and the bird guides Julio Mwambire, Japhet Garama and
Samson Katisho!

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
