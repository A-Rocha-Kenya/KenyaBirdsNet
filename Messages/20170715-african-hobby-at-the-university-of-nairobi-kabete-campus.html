  <p class="p1">Season&#39;s greetings!</p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p1">Jamhuri day found David Guarnieri and I at the University of Nairobi Kabete campus. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>After a 7am start, we were headed back to my place for coffee around 9.45, when David spotted a small raptor atop one of the power-poles in the experimental fields between the fish ponds and Kabete dam.</p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p1">We approached cautiously, taking a series of photos as we went.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Initial impression was of a Hobby, though further study of the photos had us confused because of the largely white facial pattern and rufous nape patches (see pics attached).<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The bird did a couple of circuits of the fields and adjoining woodland, returning once or twice to the same perch, giving us good views, and a few pics, of upper and undersides of the wings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Flight was fast and direct, though it failed to catch any prey while we watched.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>After about five minutes it flew away in a WSW direction. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; More pics can be viewed on our list for the morning at&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist/S41042492">http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist/S41042492</a>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p1">James Bradley and Simon Thomsett have both confirmed from the photos that it was indeed an African Hobby - &nbsp;thin long wings, unicoloured underwing, lightly streaked underside, long tail, rufous patches on nape, second moustachial stripe behind ear - for which many thanks.</p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p1">James indicated that this is the first record known to him in Nairobi since Sept 2009.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p1">Having birded the UoN campus and dam area since the mid 1990’s, and especially over the past six years, I continue to marvel at what shows up in this area.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>A group of us found a female Nubian woodpecker there in August, and of course, the Hinde’s Pied Babblers continue to be sighted from time to time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>I expect that, as the indigenous trees (planted by the U o N on the SW slopes of the dam) mature, yet more surprises will be found.</p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p1">Regards,<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p2"><br></p><p><span>
