  <pre>Dear All,
Another good record in the same general area, was a Verreaux&#39;s Eagle
perched on the rocks at Baboon Cliffs on Friday, seen from Emakoko.
With the Shikra on Monday that makes three unusual raptors for NNP in
the same area!

Best for now
Brian

&gt; A friend doing a game drive in Nairobi National Park this morning saw the
&gt; sub-adult Palm-nut Vulture again, still in the south near the Mbagathi. See
&gt; photo of the first sighting on 2nd July attached.
