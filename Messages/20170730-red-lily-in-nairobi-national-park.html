  <pre>A quick family visit to Nairobi National Park in this cold dry season
produced some good sightings:

The red lily, Cyrtanthus sanguineus, that often blooms best in dry years.
July is the usual flowering season, although it has been recorded in other
months.

A large python warming itself on the rocks next to Karen &#34;C&#34; Primary School
Dam Â­ currently dry.

A serval not far from the python, blending in well with the dry ground and
grass; and ten Bohor Reedbuck near Hyena Dam.

Oh yes, there were birds, too, including noisy nesting Sacred Ibis and over
ten African Darters on Nagolomon Dam.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
