  <pre>Dear All,
The identification of this bird has drawn to a very quick conclusion,
thanks to Nigel Hunter who located an image of female Red-billed
Firefinch of the southern race rendalli found from extreme S Tz to
southern S Afr. (Attached.) It differs from our ad fem of the race
ruberrima in blackish upper mandible, profuse white spotting below,
richer buffy yellow ground colour, indication of indistinct banding
across lower belly, read Birds of Africa to see how different the two
Red-billed Firefinch races are in female plumage.
This casual discovery has become enormously exciting, who would have
thought that Firefinches would travel such distances, and also
represents the first record in Kenya,

Best to all
Brian
