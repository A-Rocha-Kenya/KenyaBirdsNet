  <hr/>
  <pre>We&#39;ve been having the first returning Palearctic birds along the beach 
front in Watamu:
- Tues 22nd we had Greenshank calling from Mwamba centre - and today at 
Mida we counted 197.
- Weds (23rd Aug) here in Watamu, I heard my first Common Sandpiper - 
and every night since now.
- Saturday 26th - first Grey Plover calling at high tide.
- today (28th) at 11am during a staff meeting a flock of 25 Whimbrel 
flying south along the lagoon - presumably having just arrived after a 4 
or 5 day flight from Oman...?

Also today we had African Cuckoo Hawk beside the forest.

Actually, this is an awesome time to be atlassing/ bird mapping as your 
records will be able to track the arrival of the migrants from the north 
- not only the first date but as numbers pick up and species become more 
common, then they will be picked up on Full Protocol atlas cards more 
and more. Thus Full Protocol cards are by far the most useful to do if 
you can. This will allow us to map the arrival of our returning migrants 
- and record what overlap there is of Palearctic and Afrotropical 
migrants as the latter start to leave...

If you&#39;re going birding in Kenya please turn it into a contribution to 
Kenya Bird Map!
