He published many papers and articles,  and co-authored books, notably Birds of Kenya and Northern Tanzania (1996) with Dale Zimmerman and Don Turner, and Reed and Bush Warblers (2010) with Peter Kennerley which remain standard reference sources. In the 1970s, with Graeme Backhurst, he established the unique Ngulia Palearctic migrant ringing project, which continues actively to this day. <br id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1506175584597_2322"> To sit with David, studying a bird in the hand, was an educational joy and a privilege, whether in Suffolk or Africa.

A full obituary will appear in the Bulletin of the African Bird Club (25.1) in March 2018.</span></div><div id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1506175584597_2324" dir="ltr"> Richard Charles, ABC Chairman.</div></div></div></body></html>
