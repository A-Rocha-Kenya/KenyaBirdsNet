    <p>I've been birding our A Rocha Kenya plot here in Watamu for 15
      years and still turning up awesome surprises! I was in the middle
      of signing cheques with our accountant in my office yesterday
      morning about 10am when my 5-year old son, Kai, comes rushing in
      shouting "Daddy! Daddy! there's a HUGE bird in the nature
      trail!!!"... Well, he knows plenty enough about birds to know if
      it was a Hadada Ibis and the same for it being a crow... which he
      knows would not be worth running to tell me about - and if it was
      a 'huge bird' then it was not going to be one <span
        class="text_exposed_show">of the usual contenders of a robin
        chat or something... So I looked at our long-suffering
        accountant, John, and said.. "pole ndugu - got to dash...!" -
        grabbed the bins and followed Kai at pace down the path.. <br>
      </span></p>
    <p><span class="text_exposed_show">And the photo (below) is what we
        saw...! First record for Mwamba - our centre in Watamu at plot
        28. Also, as I have been in the middle of doing an atlas card
        for our atlas pentad (square) no. </span><span
        class="text_exposed_show"><span class="text_exposed_show">0320_3955,
          this guy was </span> species no.42 on the pentad full
        protocol card - and I've still got another full day to go </span><span
        class="text_exposed_show"><span class="text_exposed_show">of the
          five days per card </span>that you have to try and get as
        many species as possible for it - 70 would be acceptable! Have
        had flocks of Euro Bee-eaters passing through for 2-3 weeks now;
        only two Barn Swallows up until last weekend when I saw another
        two and then today 6 went past heading south along the beach...
        their numbers have yet to pick up. Spot Fly's have been reported
        from elsewhere around Watamu/Mida but I've yet to have one here
        at Mwamba.Â  <br>
      </span></p>
    <p><span class="text_exposed_show"><img
          src="cid:part1.35B5EF48.C951B1EC@arocha.org" alt=""
          height="447" width="481"><br>
      </span></p>
    <p><span class="text_exposed_show">The Afrotropical migrants have
        yet to leave - and by repeating Full Protocol cards at 6 day
        intervals you then can get a beautiful picture of the arrival
        and departure of migrants. Red-capped Robin Chats are practicing
        their songs seriously in the bush / forest around us - mimicking
        Emerald Cuckoos, nightjars, bee-eaters and Crowned Eagles all in
        the same breath. Yellowbills also still present and vocal. <br>
      </span></p>
    <p><span class="text_exposed_show">The atlas is already producing
        really interesting results - will post some of the early results
        in due course for your interest. Anyone who's able to, please do
        contribute your records from any birding around now to the atlas
        as your data will make a significant contribution to helping
        build up the picture of what our birds are doing.<br>
      </span></p>
