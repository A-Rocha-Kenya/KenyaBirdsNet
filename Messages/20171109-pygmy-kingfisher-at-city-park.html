  <pre>Greetings birders

Seven intrepid birders met for the Wednesday Morning Birdwalk as election
results trickled in. We decided to visit City Park, where Patrick Ngotho
showed us roosting African Wood Owls.

A thrilling surprise was to find an African Pygmy Kingfisher near the
cemetery. Not sure whether it is a resident, or a seasonal migrant from the
South.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
