  <p><span>Hello,</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p>On Feb 25th, David Guarnieri and I heard Babbler-like calls above the dam at the eastern end of the University farm, Kabete campus, at around 7.30am. &nbsp; We found two Hinde&#39;s Pied-Babblers in bushy habitat; a photograph of one is attached, and more photos are posted on our list for the site (http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist/S34806280). &nbsp;A third bird appeared to be deeper within the scrub, but we were unable to confirm by sight. &nbsp;This record appears to be at the extreme southern end of this species&#39; range, and I would be interested to hear others&#39; thoughts on this. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Also of note, both Montane and Abyssinian/White-bellied White-eyes were seen in an area of replanted indigenous trees at the western end of the dam (photos also on the eBird list).</p><p><br></p><p>Regards,</p><p><br></p><p>Simon Carter</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
