  <pre>Dear All,
Alex Kirschel and his team have kindly made available their just
published paper that highlights uniqueness in the fischeri form of
Yellow-rumped Tinkerbird on the Kenya coast, and apart from that it is
only on Zanzibar.
It is a very informative read, and interested parties should see the
latest news on this interesting group.


Hi Brian,

Absolutely do share it, the paper is open access and anyone can read
it / download it from the following link:

Best wishes,

Alex
