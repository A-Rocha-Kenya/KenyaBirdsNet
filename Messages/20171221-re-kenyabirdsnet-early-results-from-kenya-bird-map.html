      <p>
  
  
    </p><p>The Kenya Bird Map has been running for around three years and we
      are getting some really interesting early results from it now.
      Because of its neatly tight protocol that is simple to follow (and
      with the excellent smartphone app, BirdLasser, that makes it
      easier still), the data generated are wonderfully analysable with
      relative ease (you don&#39;t need a super-computer!). <br>
    </p>
    <p>We&#39;ve generated some plots of the phenology (seasonality / change
      over time) of some species of interest and I thought to share a
      few with you here in the hope that it will stimulate further
      interest in both contributing records to the atlas (the more data,
      the better the results and more useful for bird conservation in
      Kenya) and in using the data (it is open source, freely available
      to all with the purpose of benefiting research and conservation).</p>
    <p>The following graphs show the reporting rate of a species across
      the year. I&#39;ll try and explain it a little! Along the Y-axis of
      the graph (the vertical line) we have &#39;reporting rate&#39; - i.e. the
      percentage of all Full Protocol cards submitted which had the
      species in question reported on them. The X-axis (horizontal along
      the bottom) shows the progression of time through the year by &#39;<b><i>pentade</i></b>&#39;
      - confusingly similar but not to be confused with a &#39;<i>pentad</i>&#39;.
      A pentade (pronounced &#39;pent-aid&#39;) is a period of FIVE DAYS (in the
      same way that a week is a period of 7 days). A pentad is the atlas
      square measuring 5 x 5 minutes. There are 73 pentades in a year
      because 365/5=73. The first pentade on this graph runs from 1 to 5
      January, the second from 6 to 10 January etc. no 73 is 27-31
      December - and there are therefore about six pentades per month. </p>
    <div class="m_-5857859323302429228_5pbx m_-5857859323302429228userContent m_-5857859323302429228_3576" id="m_-5857859323302429228js_c0">
      <p> Each &#39;X&#39; on the plot represents the reporting rate in each
        pentade. The red line is the smoothed average reporting rate
        through the year. The smoothed line is not a formal model, it is
        simply designed to lead the eye through the data - but it is a
        sophisticated smoother (thanks to Les Underhill who in fact
        produced these plots for us).</p>
      <p>Starting with a common species which gives an idea just how the
        data will show what would be an expected pattern - the Common
        Bulbul, a common resident. Here, the reporting rate is high
        (65-70% of cards have the bulbul reported on them) and is
        consistent throughout the year - i.e. it is resident, numbers
        don&#39;t fluctuate - just as you would have thought!<br>
      </p>
      <p><img src="cid:part1.4C35B8F0.5A98F705@arocha.org" alt="" width="305" height="305"></p>
      <p>A similar pattern is shown by the Woodland Kingfisher - but
        here the reporting rate is much lower (2-3%) as it is a far less
        common species than the bulbul:</p>
      <p><img src="cid:part2.99AAF49B.45F477FB@arocha.org" alt="" width="311" height="311"></p>
      <p>Looking at well-known migrants, here is a not very surprising
        overall pattern for a common Palearctic species, the Willow
        Warbler, but with some very sweet detail within it:</p>
      <p><img src="cid:part3.26965BDF.6D116767@arocha.org" alt="" width="349" height="349"></p>
      <p> What this immediately tells us is that this is a migrant that
        during the middle part of the year (June-Sept) it is entirely
        absent from Kenya, that there is a rapid arrival in Oct to late
        November with a slight peak in numbers in early December. During
        the heart of the northern winter, Willow Warblers are not too
        hard to find (c.20% reporting rate) but there is a clear arrival
        from the second half of February, presumably of migrants from
        the south, when they then become definitely more common in the
        northward migration in March / early April before a rapid
        departure with all gone by the end of May (and the steepness of
        the slope tells us the departure is more rapid than the arrival
        in October - i.e. the birds disappear in a shorter period than
        they arrive). <br>
      </p>
      <p> These are awesome results showing in hard figures that Willow
        Warblers are most numerous during the northward migration -
        something any of us who&#39;ve done any serious brrding in Kenya
        will know... but to have hard data showing it is superb. This
        suggests that on their way south a number must either overfly
        Kenya without stopping or migrate farther west - as is known to
        happen strongly in other species such as Red-backed Shrike. An
        area for more study...</p>
      <p>Another really interesting pattern of a migrant, this time an
        Afrotropical species, is for the Red-capped Robin Chat:</p>
      <p><img src="cid:part4.0701DF82.0B5564F2@arocha.org" alt="" width="385" height="385"></p>
      <p>This is the opposite pattern to the Willow Warbler as it
        migrates south to breed during our summer - December-March -
        when you can see it is absent. One or two start to appear in
        March but there is a rapid arrival in May and apparently a
        second arrival in July - or, given it comes to a sharp peak
        towards the end of August, this would appear as a passage of
        birds since the reporting rate then drops off steadily through
        to the end of the year. An awesome picture of this species&#39;
        seasonality, no? It raises interesting questions for further
        research - e.g. if there is a passage of birds, where are they
        on passage from? <br>
      </p>
      <p>Some may know that there are, in fact, resident populations of
        Red-capped Robin Chat as well, mostly inland - which has not
        been picked up by the data. This is because they are far
        commoner on the coast where they are a clear migrant and so
        these are the ones that have been reported so far. For the
        inland resident populations you have to go looking hard to find
        the species and so we need more observations, more records to
        show this - i.e. more birders out there joining in on what is
        definitely going to be the key bird conservation project of the
        next 10 to 20 years for Kenya. <br>
      </p>
      <p>These results have been produced from what are actually
        relatively very small amounts of data - which shows the huge
        strength of the bird atlas protocol - simple, yet tight,
        producing very analysable data. The protocol is simply: within a
        single atlas square, min of 2 hours focussed birding over a five
        day period (a pentade...) and record all species in the order
        you encounter them noting the total seen after each hour of
        birding. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The potential for digging out a wide range of extremely
        relevant and important patterns for bird conservation is
        enormous - with sufficient data you can produce the same plots
        as above but annually to see any changes in migration pattern
        over time (possibly caused by climate change, for e.g.); species
        that are under threat - e.g. vultures - will show over time an
        overall decrease in reporting rate, proving beyond doubt that
        there IS a problem..., when government takes action and they
        start to recover (here&#39;s hoping!), then the atlas data will pick
        this up and show it. <br>
      </p>
      <p>These plots are taking data from the whole of Kenya - with
        sufficient data, you can do the same analysis for a given area
        (e.g. a ranch, a conservation area), even just a single pentad
        and see local patterns of phenology (e.g. dry season movements).
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>The possibilities go on and on. If you are at all interested in
        birds and their conservation in Kenya, please do join us in this
        exciting project. The protocol is simple and actually a heck of
        a lot of fun to do, it hones your birding skills even further
        and gets to be quite addictive (perhaps there should be a
        warning put on it?!). <br>
