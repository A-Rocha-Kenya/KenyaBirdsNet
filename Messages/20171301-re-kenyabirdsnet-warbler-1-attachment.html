  <pre>Thanks  Brian, Sydney is of the same view. I have never seen one like it before. Our current location is a long way from the Lake I&#39;m afraid but I am doing as much birding as I can. Cheers Jez

Hi Jez,
I think this is a bright acredula in spring plumage. The feature that is unusual is the amount of yellow meeting across the forehead. In spite of having a yellowish breast and white underparts, it doesn&#39;t have the intensity of yellow that spring Wood Warblers have, and most importantly the face below the eye is darkish not  the same shade of yellow as the supercilium. It&#39;s an unusual view though.
I hope you get time to let us know what is on the lake-shore. Birders never seem to get to Turkana at this time of year nowadays, and there should still be exciting stuff around.
Best for now
Brian
