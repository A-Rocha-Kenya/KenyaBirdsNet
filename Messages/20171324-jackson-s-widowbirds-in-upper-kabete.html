  <div dir="ltr">Dear all,<br><br>Today at the University of Nairobi&#39;s Upper Kabete Campus field station, I had a sighting of 3 Jackson&#39;s Widowbirds. 2 adult males in breeding plumage and 1 female. Fleur Ng&#39;weno and Peter Muriithi previously told me that they used to see them in the area a few years ago, but I&#39;m not aware of any recent sightings. I&#39;ve been birding here for about 2 years and had never seen any. Glad to know they still use the area.<br><br>Best regards,<br>Sidney</div>
