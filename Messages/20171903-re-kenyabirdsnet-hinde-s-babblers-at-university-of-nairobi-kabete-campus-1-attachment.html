  <div dir="ltr"><div><div>Hi Simon,<br><br>This is a super observation. It&#39;s a first record for Nairobi as far as I know and long overdue. They&#39;ve been present within 2-3kms of the northern and eastern city limits for decades, including observations from Ruiru and Kiambu in the last 12-15 months. There are also records to the south of Nairobi, from Athi River and Machakos southeast to Kitui, but Loresho would be the westernmost record to date.<br><br></div>Thanks for sharing,<br><br></div>James<br></div><div class="gmail_extra"><br><div class="gmail_quote">On 2 March 2017 at 18:12, <a href="mailto:simonchiz@gmail.com">simonchiz@gmail.com</a> [kenyabirdsnet] <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:kenyabirdsnet-noreply@yahoogroups.com" target="_blank">kenyabirdsnet-noreply@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex">
