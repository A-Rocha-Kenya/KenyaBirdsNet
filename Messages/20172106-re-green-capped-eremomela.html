  <pre>Dear Nigel,  This is indeed a fantastic record of the little known 
endemic race kikuyuensis, which Van Someren collected from Nairobi 
(believed the western suburbs) in November 1916, but did not describe 
it until 1931. It is very localized in the Thika, Embu and Meru 
districts, but has not been recorded from Nairobi for a very very 
long time, in fact I doubt there are any dated records.    Well worth 
writing up for Scopus.

Great news
Don
