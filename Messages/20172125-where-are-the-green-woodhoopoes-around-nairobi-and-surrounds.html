  <pre>Dear All,
I am writing now for information of Woodhoopoes in Nairobi County and surrounds.

In the last Scopus there was an article by Don Turner that gave
evidence that the three species, Green, Violet and Black-billed should
be treated as the same species pending any results to the contrary
from genetic analysis. There are actually so many East African birds,
especially groups that are in dire need of laboratory examination. I
agree with Don who has been examining specimens from various
collections, that we should as it stands at present, regard the three
as members of the same species. Which should in no way preclude people
from taking an interest in the differences, and recording them as if
they were valid species. Once forms are lumped there is a general
disinterest in the races, and we have been caught out a few times in
lost information during this period when a lumped form is suddenly
split again!

In the Scopus paper it stated that birds around Nairobi including the
National Park are the race marwitzi. Which although with a green gloss
is stated to be a little more bluer than other races of Green. The
distribution of marwitzi is shown in Z&amp;T as a solid black area
covering much of the southern part of the entire country from extreme
east to extreme west and the entire border with Tanzania.
The Violet Wood-Hoopoe P damarensis granti is a riverine forest
specialist of the Tana, Galana-Athi, Tiva  and Ewaso Nyiro systems.
The closest is comes to Nairobi according to the literature is
Kibwezi. Green Wood-hoopoe it appears, is found throughout the Violet
range apart from middle Tana.
