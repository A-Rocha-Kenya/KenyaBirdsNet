      <p>Dear All,<br>
On 1st March, I set off for Kakamega with Adam and Vicky Kennedy. The<br>
idea was to obtain images for species that were poorly represented or<br>
missing for the forthcoming Birds of East Africa photographic<br>
guide…such as Toro Olive Greenbul, Chapin’s Flycatcher, Turner’s<br>
Eremomela and Forest Hyliota (called Southern in the literature).<br>
<br>
We stopped for a short while at Timboroa Dam, and briefly had a male<br>
African Marsh Harrier, although once a regularly observed species from<br>
many parts of the country, this was my first in Kenya for over ten<br>
years, such is its rarity now. In fact there are hardly any records at<br>
all for that same period. It was an exciting observation. Other birds<br>
there included a pair of Lesser Jacanas and Levaillant’s Cisticolas.<br>
<br>
We took the Lessos Road to Kapsabet, the road is in excellent<br>
condition and the recommended way for getting to Rondo Retreat Centre<br>
where we were staying for three nights.<br>
<br>
The next morning we drove the short distance to the South Nandi Forest<br>
extension for the forest species. In the section we worked which was<br>
less than a kilometre in length we had five Chapin’s Flycatchers, they<br>
remained high but one image was taken clearly showing how pale they<br>
are compared to the other population in Bwindi (SW Uganda).  Of the<br>
two Hyliotas met with, the nice adult got away but we did manage<br>
images of a fairly scruffy immature. But the highlight was a party of<br>
five Turner’s Eremomelas, not because of any rarity, but their<br>
abnormal behaviour. They stayed with us for twenty minutes until we<br>
were saturated with them and left them where they were. These birds<br>
were feeding in Vernonia heads around two metres from the ground, and<br>
were actually dropping to the ground. They were absolutely relaxed<br>
with us.<br>
Never have I heard of such a thing in this mid to high canopy species,<br>
and on questioning the resident guides none of them had ever seen<br>
anything like this in their lives.<br>
The images on the attached montage are not photos but grabs taken from<br>
the lengthy video I took.<br>
<br>
After lunch we took the Yala Reserve Road alongside Rondo. Along here<br>
we had three Green-backed Twinspots feeding using their strange<br>
broken-wing technique. They were constantly shuffling and throwing<br>
themselves at patches of dead leaves, then pecking rapidly and<br>
presumably had disturbed small insects. They were doing this for a<br>
very long period and maybe with the lack of food in the middle layers<br>
of the forest as a result of the dry conditions, were forced to feed<br>
on the ground. A browse at the literature shows no mention of this<br>
weird feeding strategy, not in the “Handbook, Birds of Africa” nor<br>
Clement et al, “Finches and Sparrows.”<br>
One bird (an immature) was videoed for some time whilst thus feeding.<br>
Although best described as a “broken-wing” movement, the head  and the<br>
tail are lowered, and the bird shuffles, randomly changing directions<br>
left or right in a haphazard pattern. The wings are held tight and the<br>
effect is hunchbacked, and very rodent-like. Sometimes when suddenly<br>
throwing itself at dry leaves, its head would disappear under them for<br>
a short while. The next day we found three Green-backed Twinspots<br>
(adults and imm) in Zimmermann’s Grid, doing exactly the same thing.<br>
Unfortunately the road was blocked by a fallen tree, and with much sky<br>
rumbling we turned back without reaching the river. Some Toro Olive<br>
Greenbuls called and reacted to playback. The birds were moving<br>
rapidly around us, leaving the cover to perch in pine trees (another<br>
bizarre first!). On the Saturday morning we found very responsive<br>
birds right at the accommodation block and secured the desired images.<br>
For the video it was a nightmare as the birds move too rapidly and the<br>
aperture too small, but there is a grab attached. After late afternoon<br>
rain on the Friday, Saturday morning saw White-spotted Flufftails out<br>
feeding like chickens in a run. Just along the ravine track alongside<br>
the buildings we had eight and of course there were others all along<br>
the creek.<br>
<br>
A few other points of interest. Three species are now resident in the<br>
garden that I never remember previously, White-browed Robin-Chat,<br>
Yellow-throated Leaflove (Greenbul), and Diederic Cuckoo. This might<br>
all testify to the thinning of the environment which is out of<br>
control. There is now no-where along the road where the foliage from<br>
the right side comes anywhere touching foliage from the left side<br>
which is distressing and the road is wide enough to land a small<br>
plane! Things have seriously changed for the worse.<br>
<br>
Another interesting thing was that the Red-rumped Swallows of the area<br>
are white not rufous, and look a shade smaller. There were a pair of<br>
adults breeding and collecting mud, all underparts, near complete<br>
collar, underwing coverts were whitish but the rump was reddish. There<br>
were no streaks anywhere on the underparts. There seems to be a<br>
different race rather than emini, on its way to resembling West<br>
African Swallow. As the birds were nest-building this is assumed to be<br>
as good as they are going to get, but this is nothing like the<br>
chestnut breeding plumage that the seemingly stockier emini from<br>
Nairobi attain.<br>
<br>
Leaving, we went back the same route and stopped at Timboroa Dam<br>
again. We were delighted to see a pair of African Marsh Harriers<br>
quartering the swamp, and spending long periods just sitting on the<br>
reeds. On one occasion they called, and it looks like this pair is<br>
going to breed, which will be a wonderful event. Great images were<br>
taken and there are a few grabs of the male on the montage, (upper<br>
two) whilst the female is the lower. She might be a young bird with a<br>
streaky pale breast band, the male was a stunning individual. As you<br>
can see the images in S&amp;F and Z&amp;T look nothing like an adult male<br>
plumage and the bird is far far more attractive in life, and is grey<br>
not dark brown. Also this bird is more prominently chequered on the<br>
flight feathers from above than below. Very many submitted images of<br>
African Marsh Harriers over the years have been Western Marsh<br>
Harriers.<br>
<br>
The bottom left image is a Green Hylia also from the video.<br>
<br>
Calling in at Manguo Ponds it was wall to wall birds, but sadly too<br>
dark by now to see what was there and no telescope. What was<br>
noteworthy were, the over 5000 Yellow Wagtails roosting in the nearer<br>
sedges, looking like the vegetation was strewn with fruits.<br>
<br>
On Sunday 5th, I joined the expedition to Kakuzi Estate to look for<br>
the Orange-winged Pytilias.. We failed to positively locate these but<br>
some high-pitched quite loud sharp notes were heard from some scrub<br>
but the birds not seen. For me the most interesting was a pair of<br>
Senegal Plovers. Whilst in S&amp;F the map shows a block of distribution<br>
from Lake Victoria across to the coast, the true range is nothing like<br>
that. I have located one old Thika record and one for Meru NP. The<br>
only vagrant bird I had encountered before was one flying over Baringo<br>
at night! The true range of the species in Kenya is almost confined to<br>
the Mara in the west, but occasionally around Lake Victoria. On the<br>
coast it is common in the Tana Delta in places, particularly Nairobi<br>
Ranch. At times it occurs on grasslands at Gongoni, Sabaki and Mida.<br>
It is reported as regular  in Tsavo, but I have never had it there. So<br>
this pair at Kakuzi were very special to me. Our host Nikolai van Beek<br>
who lives on the estate said that he saw a pair a couple of months<br>
previously.<br>
There are two images on the montage. In brief the birds differ from<br>
Black-winged Plover in;<br>
 a) the white on the forehead is smaller and defined, not extending<br>
back to and over the eye as in BWP.<br>
b) the eye is bright yellow with faint yellow orbital ring, lacking<br>
the reddish orbital ring of BWP whose eyes are also more<br>
orange-yellow.<br>
c) the grey breast terminates in a narrow clear black band, not the<br>
broad black band that is more diffused in BWP.<br>
d) fairly lanky longer legs and feet entirely blackish-grey, entirely<br>
reddish tinged in BWP and they are shorter.<br>
e) in flight SP has all brownish wing coverts, but very contrasting<br>
all white secondaries, whereas in BWP this is entirely reversed with<br>
white wing coverts forming diagonal bands that give a broad “V” across<br>
the wings. In a sitting BWP this forms a very narrow white line along<br>
the edge of the body, in SP this shows on the sitting bird as a small<br>
white notch.<br>
f) finally the calls are entirely different, BWP has a very loud and<br>
rasping “kreek-kreek…” call that often lasts for a long time, but SP<br>
has a softer but nevertheless far carrying melodic “kuu-yu” usually<br>
bisyllabic with second note lower and given between long pauses.<br>
<br>
Best to all<br>
Brian<br>
