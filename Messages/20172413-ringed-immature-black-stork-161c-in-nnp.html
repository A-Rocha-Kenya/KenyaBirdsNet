  <pre>Dear All,
This immature Black Stork was photographed in Nairobi NP by Patricia
Heather-Hayes.

As it is a young bird, it would suggest that it was ringed at the nest
as a nestling, can anyone advise where there are Black Stork projects
using rings such as this. It has a story to tell!

Best for now
Brian
