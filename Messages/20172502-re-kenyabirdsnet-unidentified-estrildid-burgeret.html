rendalli not recorded in Kenya before,
Very best
Brian

&gt; I&#39;m no expert on estrildids but this looks like a female Red-billed
&gt; Firefinch to me.

&gt;&gt; Dear All,
&gt;&gt; I was going through bird photos with a friend from Burgeret,
&gt;&gt; identifying the species taken in his garden. It was pretty
&gt;&gt; straightforward with Greater-Blue-eared and Superb Starlings, Hadada,
&gt;&gt; Verreauxâ€™s Eagle-Owl, Harrier Hawk, Red-cheeked Cordon-bleu etc, and
&gt;&gt; now the next one. I looked at the image and thought this is all wrong.
&gt;&gt; I would like to hear opinions of this bird, I have some suggestions
&gt;&gt; but it is not positively identified. The birds that it most resembles
&gt;&gt; have just one race of each species throughout the country, so it is
&gt;&gt; not just a case of a race with which I am not familiar.
&gt;&gt; Best to all
&gt;&gt; Brian
&gt;&gt;
