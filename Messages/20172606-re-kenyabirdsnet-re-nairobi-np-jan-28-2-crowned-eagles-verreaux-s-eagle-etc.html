  <pre>Hi Nate,
Another very interesting posting. Sorry for the Customer &#34;Service&#34;
Employee not being there.
Whilst they used to be a very regular visitors loafing on the rocks at
Leopard Cliffs, I think you have seen the first Verreaux&#39;s Eagle in
the Park for over ten years,
Best for now
Brian

&gt;
&gt; I enjoyed a good day&#39;s birding around Nairobi NP this past Sunday with
&gt; Roger Smith and Ben Mugambi.  We ended with 118 bird species, due to
&gt; concentrating on mammals (particularly Suni and Rhino) in addition to
&gt; just birds.  Leaving the East Gate just before 6pm, we had an issue
&gt; with &#34;staff abandoning their gate post early&#34; which I will comment on
&gt; later.
&gt;
&gt; A highlight of the day was a pair of Crowned Eagles over the forest
&gt; not far from Nairobi Tented Camp.  We went from Suni sighting to
&gt; sighting (18 individuals!) after making the left hand turn below
&gt; Nagalomon Dam.  Just after crossing the Kisimbe River (west of Nairobi
&gt; Tented Camp), I heard a familiar manic whistling call (and hoped it
&gt; was not a clever mimic).   Then Ben spotted a single adult Crowned
&gt; Eagle circling high that quickly soared behind the treeline.  We drove
&gt; forward a bit to an opening where we could look back towards the eagle
&gt; location and saw two adult Crowned Eagles soaring together.  One did a
&gt; diving display a couple of times.  It was noteworthy that all Suni
&gt; immediately disappeared after we first heard the Crowned Eagle
&gt; vocalizing; we did not have another Suni sighting afterwards.
&gt;
&gt; We also had a Verreaux&#39;s Eagle perched and then in flight in the
&gt; Mokoyet Valley not far from the Emakoko.
&gt;
&gt; It was also nice to see a pair of Black Rhino out in the open - exact
&gt; location undisclosed for reasons of tradecraft.
&gt;
&gt; We started the morning entering the East Gate, since the line was
&gt; already pretty long at the main gate at 6:45am.  From the picnic area
&gt; just inside the gate, we enjoyed watching around 3 dozen Little
&gt; Swifts, 1/3 that many Palm Swifts, a couple of Scarce Swifts and a
&gt; handful of Barn Swallows.  Might have been a White-rumped Swift or two
&gt; mixed in, but it was hard to tell.  We did not see any Mottled or
&gt; Pallid type Swifts to try and photograph, as per Brian&#39;s recent
&gt; request.  Also present were Red-billed Quelea, Rufous Sparrow, Common
&gt; Fiscal, Superb Starling and other common + expected birds.
&gt;
&gt; A puffed-up Kori Bustard was just south of the East Gate, and the dam
&gt; not far to the west (Eland Dam?) held some waterbirds and shorebirds.
&gt; A pair of Red-billed Teal kept trying to sleep through the racket of a
&gt; pair of Coke&#39;s Hartebeest butting horns in earnest.  The water&#39;s edge
&gt; held an African Jacana, a few Blacksmith Lapwings, a Three-banded
&gt; Plover, 2 Wood Sandpipers, and a Little Stint.  Driving away from the
&gt; dam, we had a covey of five Shelley&#39;s Francolins.
&gt;
&gt; Hyena Dam held 12 Long-toed Lapwings, 10 Blacksmith Lapwings, 6
&gt; Spur-winged Lapwings, and a couple of Three-banded Plovers.  Other
&gt; shorebirds included three Common Snipe, 9 Black-winged Stilt, 4 Wood
&gt; Sandpipers, and half a dozen Little Stint.  We did not see any African
&gt; Water Rails but four Black Crakes walked and flew around brazenly.
&gt; One of the Marabou Storks present kept washing part of a blue plastic
&gt; shopping bag and trying to swallow it.  Another had a broken foot that
&gt; others pecked and pulled.  We later saw the same bird around 5:30pm
&gt; preparing to roost with lots of other storks beside Athi Dam.  Other
&gt; birds present at Hyena Dam included a pair of Crowned Cranes.  A
&gt; drying-up boggy patch nearby held a  Green Sandpiper and a couple of
&gt; Common Snipe.
&gt;
&gt; We made our way to Nagalomon Dam, which was pretty quiet birdwise
&gt; except for a pair of Lesser Swamp Warblers, a White-headed Barbet and
&gt; a Malachite Kingfisher.  But we did see a young male Lion chase a herd
&gt; of Impala on the far side of the dam.
&gt;
&gt; In general it was hard to find much Typha or reeds around dams -
&gt; presumably due to drying conditions and hungry Buffalo.
&gt;
&gt; After the Suni and Crowned Eagle encounters (poor photo of an Eagle
&gt; attached), we enjoyed good birding at the Kingfisher Picnic site.  A
&gt; couple of African Moustached Warblers were working out their
&gt; territorial boundaries and one sat up and sang fairly out in the open
&gt; (photo attached).   Two Brown Parisomas fed actively and although they
&gt; did not mind us, presented a challenging target to photograph.  A pair
&gt; of Red-throated Tits foraged and scolded nearby birds and mammals.
&gt; There was also a pair of Chin-spot Batis, Scarlet-chested Sunbirds,
&gt; the requisite Striped Kingfisher and Red-cheeked Cordon Bleus.
&gt;
&gt; At 5pm the Athi Basin had Fawn-coloured Lark, Yellow-necked Spurfowl,
&gt; and Pangani Longclaw.  Athi Dam and the surrounding area had hordes of
&gt; Marabou Storks, with a few Yellow-billed Storks, a Black Stork, a
&gt; handful of White Storks and some Cattle Egrets.  A lone White-faced
&gt; Whistling-Duck was present among Egyptian Geese and shorebirds
&gt; included a Ruff, Kittlitz&#39;s Plover, Spur-winged Lapwing, Blacksmith
&gt; Lapwing, Little Stint, Common Sandpiper and Wood Sandpiper.   The
&gt; shoreline also held a small flock of Fischer&#39;s Sparrow-Larks.
&gt;
&gt; It was a drag to see the SGR monstrosity looming near Athi dam and
&gt; earlier along the southern region of the park we saw what seemed to be
&gt; cattle grazing inside the park well across the Mbagathi River.
&gt;
&gt; When we attempted to check out of the east gate at 5:59pm, we were
&gt; told the gate attendant / customer service representative had already
&gt; left.  They were supposed to be present until 6:30pm.  Due to a dinner
&gt; engagement I had at 7, we did not have time to go round to check out
&gt; of the main gate.  This meant Ben had to return another day to get
&gt; officially checked out.  When we stopped by the Langata gate the next
&gt; morning just before 7am on our way to Corner Baridi, it was still
&gt; closed with no staff in sight.  Not unexpected given all Brian&#39;s posts
&gt; about that gate attendant chronically showing up late for work.
&gt;
&gt; It is surprising how little staff accountability exists at the park
&gt; where KWS headquarters is located!
&gt;
&gt; This, plus the recent news that National Parks will no longer accept
&gt; cash for admission (M-pesa only), put a bit of a damper on things.
&gt;
&gt; Good birding,
&gt;
