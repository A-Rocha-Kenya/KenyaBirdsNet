  <pre>THE MBAGATHI RIVER CEASES TO RUN IN NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK, NO NOT A
DROUGHT BUT HEAVY MACHINERY AND DELIBERATE DAMMING PLUS EXTENSIVE
DESTRUCTION TO THE RIVERINE FOREST.

Mbagathi River, the only perennial running water in the entire Park,
has been dammed and obviously with the blessing of KWS so the Oil
Pipeline can run through the eastern part of NNP.
Maybe I am wrong but I thought it was illegal to dam a waterway in
this country, especially when peoples existence downstream are
affected, apparently not so. KWS would not allow such a thing if it
were illegal…. surely. Mr. Leakey the environments guardian would not
turn a blind eye to such an action……surely. KWS would have organised
the research into environmental impact and a legitimate Environmental
Imapact Study Report wouldn’t they?
Anyway I will let the images tell the story,
Best to all
Brian
