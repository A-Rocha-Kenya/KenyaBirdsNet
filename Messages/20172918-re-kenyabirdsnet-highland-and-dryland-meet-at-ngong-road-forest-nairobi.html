  <pre>Hi Fleur and all,
Interesting that there are no southern palearctic migrants yet, like
Red-backed Shrike, Olive Tree Warbler etc., so far all birds that
could have wintered in Kenya, (maybe apart from the two Semi-collared
Flycatcher records).They must be coming soon, and it seems the Mara is
also experiencing the same, apart from Lesser Spotted Eagle passage
and the odd Hobby.
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Greetings birders
&gt;
&gt; Nature Kenya&#39;s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk started slowly at the Racecourse
&gt; on the edge of Ngong Road Forest this week, but ended up producing exciting
&gt; records. Highlights included:
&gt;
&gt; A pair of Crowned Eagles near the nest they have used for many years.
&gt;
&gt; Highland forest birds that live in the Ngong Road Forest but are hard to
&gt; see, namely Brown-chested Alethe and Yellow-whiskered Greenbul (seen but
&gt; not
&gt; heard!), and highland birds such as Northern Double-collared Sunbird and
&gt; Golden-breasted Bunting.
&gt;
&gt; Unexpected dryland birds included Cinnamon-chested Rock Bunting and
&gt; Black-faced Waxbill.
&gt;
&gt; Northern migrants were Eurasian Bee-eaters, Isabelline Shrike, Common
&gt; Whitethroat, Northern Wheatear, Spotted Flycatcher and Yellow Wagtail.
&gt;
&gt; Wishing you good birding, Fleur
&gt;
&gt;
