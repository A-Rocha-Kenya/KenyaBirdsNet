      <p>
  
  
    </p><p>With House Crows being reported in Emali the current push to get
      the crow control started again is very welcome. There is a real
      need to get rid of these pests. However, in advance of the control
      work we urgently need to have clear cut data on where the crows
      occur and at what level of abundance so the control can be
      properly monitored.<br>
    </p>
    <p>We are therefore launching a drive to map all the bird atlas
      pentads (atlas squares) where the House Crow might occur in order
      to do this. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Why not get involved in contributing to the Kenya Bird Map to
      help assess the status of this pest and its impact on indigenous
      birds both before, during and after the poisoning? <br>
    </p>
    <p>By atlassing all the coastal pentads regularly we will be able to
      track the (hopeful) decline of the crows as poisoning starts --
      and the increase in local species. <br>
    </p>
    <p>This is a real conservation issue that the Kenya Bird Map is the
      only practical and feasible tool that can demonstrate both what
      the effect of the poisoning on the crow distribution and
      population size but also the knock-on effect of the crow control
      on common indigenous birds. Your contributions WILL make a
      difference.</p>
    <p>The way it works is actually very simple given the
      straightforward and tight protocol for the atlas (made even easier
      by using the very easy-to-use <a href="https://www.birdlasser.com/" target="_blank">BirdLasser</a> app):</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Currently for many of the coastal pentads you will get 100%
        reporting rate of crows in every Full Protocol card - i.e. if
        you put effort into 2 hours of birding in those coastal pentads
        you will definitely see House Crows EVERY time. Furthermore
        because the mapping method is to record species in the order you
        see / encounter them, then House Crows will always be in the top
        10 if not 5 or even 3 species you see since they are just so
        common.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>As poisoning starts and hopefully crow numbers drop, then we
        should get to see both a drop in the reporting rate (i.e. it is
        not recorded for every Full Protocol card) AND it will occur
        lower down the list as to when it was seen. Using both of these
        factors, calculations can be done as to abundance and thus
        change in abundance over time - IF repeated cards are submitted
        for the same pentads.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>SO... please! If birding at all on the coast - get registered
      (email <a class="gmail-m_-4347167280567407663moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:kenyabirdmap@naturekenya.org" target="_blank">kenyabirdmap@naturekenya.org</a> for this) and see if you can
      do a full protocol card for the pentad where you are staying - or
      better still go hit one or two of the more far flung coastal
      pentads that either haven&#39;t been done yet or are only yellow or
      orange in colour.. i.e. 1 to 3 cards only (see <a href="http://kenyabirdmap.adu.org.za/coverage.php#menu_top" target="_blank">the
        coverage map</a> for the atlas). <br>
    </p>
    <p>The aim is to <b>&quot;Turn the Coast <font color="#33cc00">Green</font>&quot;</b>
      (when a pentad has four Full Protocol cards submitted, it turns
      green on the coverage map).</p>
    <p>Repeated visits to the same pentads after that will then allow us
      to monitor the progress of the crow control - do get involved!</p>

            <p>Good news and bad news on the bird front:<br>
              <br>
              On World Migratory Bird Day, May 10, Nature Kenya&#39;s
              Wednesday Morning<br>
              Birdwalk saw a migratory bird ­ although most of the
              northern migrants have<br>
              left. It was a Sedge Warbler, feeding on the ground near a
              marsh in Karura<br>
              Forest. Thanks to Friends of Karura Forest for a terrific
              bird walk, with<br>
              over 55 species in two and a half hours.<br>
              <br>
              Today May 11, however, a report from Brian Finch of a
              House Crow in Emali.<br>
              With the proliferation of human habitation along the road
              and railway line<br>
              between Mombasa and Nairobi, House Crows may find suitable
              habitats.<br>
              <br>
