  <div dir="ltr">Hi birders,<br><br>On a Nature Kenya bird walk yesterday at Kikwata Picnic Site on the Ngong Hills, we had a brief sighting of a small flock of Eurasian Bee-eaters flying high and calling. Interestingly, we also had 3 white-eye species: plenty of Abyssinian, a single Montane/Kikuyu and 2 Yellow. On Tuesday last week, we also ringed a Yellow White-eye at the Nairobi National Museum. I think this is the first individual of this species ever ringed at the museum, but this needs to be confirmed from the records.<br><br>Best regards,<br>Sidney</div>
