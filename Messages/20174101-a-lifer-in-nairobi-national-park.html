  <pre>Greetings birders

Today I was fortunate to visit Nairobi National Park with Dale Zimmerman,
Carol Fugagli and Zachary Metha. Being Madaraka Day, a public holiday, there
were lots of visitors. Mammals and birds were plentiful. Highlights included
Sacred Ibis again nesting on Nagolomon Dam, an African White-backed Vulture
with young ones in the nest, an adult and an immature Martial Eagle, eleven
Grey Crowned Cranes (at different locations), a pair of African Water Rail
foraging in the handful of reeds remaining in Hyena Dam, and an Abyssinian
White-eye feeding young in the nest.

Bird of the day, however, was a Violet-tipped Courser. It was a lifer for
Carol ­ who spotted it ­ and for Zachary and me. We could see its enormous,
red-rimmed eyes, red base to the bill and red legs. This is an intra-African
migrant, usually nocturnal, and a new record for the park. One of the few
previous Nairobi records, according to Harvey&#39;s Annotated Checklist of the
Birds of Nairobi, was one found dead in July 1978 in Langata.

Long live Nairobi National Park!  Fleur
