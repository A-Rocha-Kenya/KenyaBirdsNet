  <pre>Hi Jez,
I think this is a bright acredula in spring plumage. The feature that
is unusual is the amount of yellow meeting across the forehead. In
spite of having a yellowish breast and white underparts, it doesn&#39;t
have the intensity of yellow that spring Wood Warblers have, and most
importantly the face below the eye is darkish not  the same shade of
yellow as the supercilium. It&#39;s an unusual view though.
I hope you get time to let us know what is on the lake-shore. Birders
never seem to get to Turkana at this time of year nowadays, and there
should still be exciting stuff around.
Best for now
Brian
