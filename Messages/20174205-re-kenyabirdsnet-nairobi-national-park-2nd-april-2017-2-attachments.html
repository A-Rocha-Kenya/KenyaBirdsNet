  <div dir='auto'>Dear birders,<div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">A visit to NNP on Apr 4 turned up many of the same birds reported by Brian from the 2nd, with a respectable day tally of 173 species. Migrants in general seemed fairly thin on the ground (try as we did, no Lesser Grey Shrikes could be found), but pride of place went to a very tatty looking Lesser Sandplover at Athi Dam among a dozen or so Kittlitz's and a few Common Ringed and Three-banded. Photos to be downloaded and shared shortly but a first spring record for Nairobi if I'm not mistaken. Six lions feeding on an unidentified carcass in the Eland Hollow area and a superb bull Black Rhino on the Rhino Circuit topped off the day.</div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">Birds and wildlife aside it was a shame to see sheep and cows with their herders through much of the bottom end of the park along the river. An open gate and readily driveable ford between Hippo Pools and the ghastly pipeline works would also allow easy and unmonitored access to the park for anyone with a map and ill intentions. Many of the roads in the park were also in atrocious condition (as was the Aitong road to Kenya's most prestigious park earlier in the trip). We were also solicited for money from the ranger at Hippo Pools which my birding friend (and first time visitor to Africa) thought extremely unprofessional. Lastly, after travelling half way around the planet, dollars in hand at the Ruma NP gate last week, we were informed they couldn't accept any cash and we would be required to queue in a bank to deposit the entry fees, or piddle around with mpesa. We had to give it a miss and what a sad reflection of where KWS is at the moment..... I won't go into the utter and complete failure of KFS to stop the wholesale destruction of montane forest on the Gwassi Hills, which appear to have lost their top predators, the formerly resident pair of Crowned Eagles.</div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">Does Kenya really value those tourist dollars?

      <p>NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 2nd April 2017<br />
<br />
Dear All,<br />
The weather had continued dry, and as there had not been any visual<br />
movement over the garden, it was thought that NNP was to be in the<br />
same position. It was, at home there has not been one migrant raptor,<br />
and the only palearctic raptors today were now parrots and not raptors<br />
anyway with single Common and Lesser Kestrels!<br />
<br />
Nigel Hunter picked me up at 6.15am, and yet again the transition<br />
through the Mpesa barrier was speedy, and we were ready in no time.<br />
Washington Wachira had been there even before us and had already<br />
completed the formalities. Jennifer Oduori arrived shortly after and<br />
still had some credit on her card and we were all through the gate at<br />
6.35am.<br />
<br />
Before this we had picked up a few birds in the Car Park, though<br />
nothing out of the ordinary a few were never met with again.<br />
<br />
It was very quiet, with the same team as last week we all soon<br />
realised that the previous Sunday was extremely exceptional and the<br />
chances of competing closely were next to nil, and beating it merely a<br />
pipe-dream. So we mentally adjusted for a much quieter day, and<br />
compared to last Sunday it really was, but compared to a normal day in<br />
the Park, today was another exceptional one and we recorded 203<br />
species. It was another day of quite intense atlassing.<br />
<br />
We started off at Ivory Burning Site, there were several Luscinia<br />
“pinking” but none singing, and the only bird we saw was a Thrush<br />
Nightingale. The usual Zanzibar Sombre Greenbuls were soon part of the<br />
dawn chorus, there was the first of eight Isabelline Shrikes but it<br />
was the same bird resident here for some time. Also the first of ten<br />
Common Whitethroats and a number of Willow Warblers which were quite<br />
widespread. The Spotted Flycatcher represented the first of over<br />
thirty as their passage intensifies. Other migrants consisted of a<br />
Garden Warbler, House Martin and of course Barn Swallows which were<br />
moving through but not in dramatic numbers yet. A sub-adult Ayre’s<br />
Hawk-Eagle flew over, and was later found perched on the Nagalomon<br />
Causeway (see image). A Brown-backed Woodpecker fed along the descent<br />
road to IBSite and whilst watching this the bushes right next to us<br />
parted and revealed a large Black Rhino at touching distance, but it<br />
behaved as if we were not there and ambled off towards the Army Camp.<br />
There were three Violet-backed Starlings which appear to be in low<br />
numbers for this time of year, presumably relating to lack of fruit.<br />
On the botanical plus side all of the Crotons of three species were<br />
full of attractive blossom, and later we were to see that all of the<br />
Acacia mellifera was also blooming en masse.<br />
The Ivory Burning arena still had an Isabelline Wheatear one of seven<br />
seen today, but not surprisingly the Northerns all appeared to have<br />
gone through.<br />
<br />
The wonderful variety of warblers we had had along the Causeway last<br />
week was not to be seen or heard, just Willow Warblers. The Dam itself<br />
was fairly busy though amazingly not a single palearctic wader,<br />
however the same White-winged Black Tern was in its third week of<br />
residence here. I have actually never known any site fidelity by<br />
visiting terns, usually just a one-day passage and gone. Seven Darters<br />
crowned the tree, every one of them an adult male, the only herons of<br />
note were a Squacco and one Great Egret, but there were six African<br />
Spoonbills and a few Sacred Ibis. On the sandbank were seven<br />
White-faced Whistling Ducks and an adult Jacana, but at the base of a<br />
typha clump was a beautiful sleepy female Greater Painted-snipe. We<br />
watched frantic courtship of a pair of Malachite Kingfishers that were<br />
in incredibly fresh and bright plumage (see image).<br />
<br />
Leaving here we took the back road to Hyena Dam, where we found a<br />
rather tatty Grey-headed Kingfisher, four stunning Blue-cheeked<br />
Bee-eaters sharing the same branches as Little Bee-eaters and a young<br />
Red-billed Oxpecker, the firsts of ten Red-backed and eight Red-tailed<br />
Shrikes. Amongst some very attractive Red-billed Queleas were a few<br />
White-winged Widowbirds with one Jackson’s that had no breeding<br />
plumage but was trying to sing.<br />
<br />
Hyena Dam was getting lower but enough to keep waders happy, but today<br />
we had to share our breakfast stop with many more people as it also<br />
had three Lions and a pair of White Rhinos! There were two large<br />
Crocodiles also hauled out on the bank, and several smaller ones<br />
around the perimeter. The dam itself kept us entertained, single Great<br />
and Yellow-billed Egrets, a Yellow-billed Stork with several Marabous,<br />
four African Spoonbills, six Red-billed Teal, one of two<br />
Black-shouldered Kites seen today, a Bateleur, Gabar Goshawk, and<br />
first of three Tawny Eagles, the enormous immature Martial Eagle which<br />
likes this area (see image), then…. the pair of extravert African<br />
Water Rails, three African Jacanas, thirty Black-winged Stilt, ten<br />
Long-toed, four Spur-winged and some twenty plus Blacksmith’s, plus a<br />
smattering of Three-banded Plovers, ten Little Stints and a Curlew<br />
Sandpiper which is uncommon here, four Ruff, a Common Snipe and the<br />
faithful Black-tailed Godwit still in residence, thirty Wood and six<br />
Common Sandpipers and as predicted no Green were seen today and have<br />
all gone north.<br />
Additionally a few Common Swifts, the first of two Eurasian Rollers<br />
seen today, the same Blue-headed Wagtail on the same one square metre<br />
feeding territory under a bush, as last week, the first of five<br />
Whinchats and first of just three Lesser Grey Shrikes.<br />
<br />
Passing by Nagalomon Dam again there was now a male Saddle-billed<br />
Stork, we continued for the forest along the Kisembe River (which was<br />
flowing), to where we had the Long-legged Buzzard last week. No<br />
raptors just here but a few Tree Pipits and what for me was the bird<br />
of the day.. Paradise Flycatcher. No ordinary Paradise Flycatcher<br />
though, but a male ferreti in all its breeding splendour. Washington<br />
skilfully managed to get a couple of images of this hyperactive<br />
individual (see image). Further along the river a very attractive<br />
immature Great Sparrowhawk was slaking its thirst. At the Rubbish-tip<br />
Vlei we found two Red-throated Pipits and three Yellow Wagtails, two<br />
flava and a stunning male lutea. A Crowned Eagle was calling nearby,<br />
hopefully from a nest.<br />
<br />
There was nothing at all on the Langata Dam, but on leaving the forest<br />
we had a small party of Eurasian Bee-eaters. Kingfisher Picnic Site<br />
had a few new species for the day including a very tame Yellow-spotted<br />
Petronia (see image), and the first of just two Olivaceous Warblers<br />
today. Also our first of the day, Wire-tailed Swallows were here, we<br />
had them at three other sites and it looks like with the sporadic<br />
appearances of this species there are movements we just don’t<br />
understand. Just past Kingfisher was a pair of Shelley’s Francolins<br />
feeding under a bush. The inside road to the murrum pits from Maasai<br />
Gate revealed a party of four Short-tailed Larks (see image), and<br />
nearby the first two of seven White-bellied Bustards. Traversing the<br />
grasslands towards Hippo Pools was quiet as is normal for this time of<br />
day, there was a Harrier-Hawk busy foot-fishing for prey in a crevice.<br />
<br />
The Rhino Circuit was quiet but did give us a few acacia specialists<br />
like Abyssinian Scimitarbill and Red-throated Tits, but the pipeline<br />
provided the first of four Pied Wheatears including a very strangely<br />
plumaged individual (see image). Athi Dam had some interesting<br />
species, with an adult Pink-backed Pelican, ten roosting Black-crowned<br />
Night-Herons, just three White Stork and six Yellow-billed Storks,<br />
eight African Spoonbills, a couple of Black-winged Stilt, a pair of<br />
Spotted Thick-knees and a pair of Temminck’s Coursers back in the<br />
grass away from the edge where the days only Secretarybird was on<br />
parade. Also five Common Ringed Plover, eight Kittlitz’s, some ten<br />
Spur-winged Plovers, fifteen Little Stint, two Ruff, a Common Snipe,<br />
several Wood, Common and a Marsh Sandpiper. In the acacias by the<br />
water were five more Blue-cheeked Bee-eaters.<br />
<br />
Now it was time for the return but the grasslands were a bit quiet,<br />
single Common and Lesser Kestrels, three different male Kori Bustards,<br />
a brief call at Eland Hollow Dam which held very little water was<br />
still attractive to a female flava Yellow Wagtail, two Red-throated<br />
Pipits and a male Pied Wheatear. The final birds for the day were back<br />
near the Hyena Dam run-off where there was a pair of Black-winged<br />
Plovers and a young male Rufous-tailed Rock-Thrush (see image).<br />
<br />
Good amounts of plains game, and many new-borns including Hartebeest,<br />
Wildebeest, Impala, Eland, Thompson’ Gazelle, Giraffe and Buffalo. The<br />
best mammal was a Grey Duiker at Kingfisher Picnic Site, lions being<br />
seen twice, and both Rhino species.<br />
<br />
We were through the gate at 6.00pm and had a final coffee in the Car<br />
Park though nothing new was added, but a stunning White-ringed Atlas<br />
Moth was sitting on the wall and a dead Wahlberg’s Epauletted<br />
Fruit-Bat was underneath the communal roost.<br />
<br />
Best to all<br />

KEY TO MONTAGE<br />
<br />
TOP FAR LEFT<br />
MALACHITE KINGFISHER<br />
Although the water level is falling, at Nagalomon Dam a pair of<br />
kingfishers was in extremely bright plumage and engaged in pairing<br />
with much chasing and posturing.<br />
<br />
FIRST RIGHT FROM TOP LEFT<br />
GREATER PAINTED-SNIPE<br />
Also at Nagalomon Dam this female Greater Painted-snipe was sleeping<br />
at the base of a clump of typha and showed no interest in waking up<br />
even with its eye open!<br />
<br />
FIRST LEFT FROM TOP RIGHT<br />
BLUE-CHEEKED BEE-EATER<br />
On the back road to Hyena Dam four birds were sitting on top of a<br />
large Acacia, and sharing the branch with Little Bee-eaters and an<br />
immature Red-billed Oxpecker. In the afternoon there were five more<br />
Blue-cheeks at Athi Dam.<br />
<br />
TOP RIGHT<br />
LESSER GREY SHRIKE<br />
Only three seen today, but it is still early for most of the<br />
contingent of this species to arrive.<br />
<br />
SECOND ROW FAR LEFT<br />
CURLEW SANDPIPER<br />
Always uncommon in NNP, this bird at Hyena Dam showed no evidence of<br />
coming in to breeding plumage.<br />
<br />
SECOND ROW FIRST RIGHT FROM FAR LEFT<br />
MARTIAL EAGLE<br />
This immature bird is photographed with a few Little Swifts which are<br />
in fact closer, showing what an impressive size this individual is.<br />
<br />
SECOND ROW FIRST LEFT FROM FAR RIGHT<br />
SADDLE-BILLED STORK<br />
The male was on his own at Nagalomon Dam.<br />
<br />
SECOND ROW FAR RIGHT<br />
PIED WHEATEAR<br />
One of four seen today. This female-plumaged but probably first year<br />
male bird shows an unusual pattern across the breast like a subdued<br />
Three-banded Plover.<br />
<br />
THIRD ROW FAR LEFT<br />
YELLOW-SPOTTED PETRONIA<br />
A tame individual at Kingfisher Picnic Site.<br />
<br />
THIRD ROW FIRST RIGHT FROM FAR LEFT<br />
RUFOUS-TAILED ROCK-THRUSH<br />
The only individual seen today, but always inexplicably uncommon in<br />
NNP. This bird was near Hyena Dam and looks like a first year male<br />
still showing more winter than summer plumage.<br />
<br />
THIRD ROW FIRST LEFT FROM FAR RIGHT<br />
WHINCHAT<br />
Five seen today, this has to be the most striking white supercilium I<br />
have ever seen on a Whinchat.<br />
<br />
THIRD ROW FAR RIGHT<br />
TEMMINCK’S COURSER<br />
A pair near Athi Dam.<br />
<br />
FOURTH ROW FAR LEFT<br />
AYRE’S HAWK-EAGLE<br />
This sub-adult was mobbed by Yellow-billed Kites whilst it perched on<br />
top of an acacia on the Nagalomon Causeway and the action was<br />
photographed by Washington.<br />
<br />
FOURTH ROW FIRST RIGHT FROM FAR LEFT<br />
BOTTOM ROW FIRST LEFT FROM FAR RIGHT<br />
SHORT-TAILED LARK<br />
Four birds were on the murrum-pit road just in from the Maasai Gate<br />
road. The very strong bill seen on the image as it typical for the<br />
species, was being hammered into the ground like a woodpecker on a<br />
branch.<br />
<br />
FOURTH ROW FAR RIGHT<br />
WHITE-RINGED ATLAS MOTH<br />
This very large insect Epiphora mythimnia was resting on the wall<br />
right at the entrance gate. The caterpillars feed on Croton and<br />
Zizyphus, and the wingspan is 12cm across.<br />
<br />
BOTTOM ROW FAR LEFT AND INSET<br />
AFRICAN PARADISE FLYCATCHER<br />
For me this was bird of the day. The most beautiful plumage of any<br />
Paradise Flycatchers in East Africa. This is a full adult male in<br />
breeding plumage belonging to the form ferreti. It is only the third<br />
time I have ever seen it in NNP, and the two previous were both only<br />
just growing the tail streamers, and patchy-plumaged. This bird was in<br />
deep forest along the Kisembe River in Kisembe Forest. The form can<br />
easily be recognised by the large amount of white on the wing, but<br />
more so from the very beautiful tail with fine ribbons of white on an<br />
otherwise rufous tail. Washington skilfully managed to get some images<br />
of this extremely active bird.<br />
<br />
BOTTOM ROW FIRST RIGHT FROM FAR LEFT<br />
CATTLE EGRET<br />
This is a Cattle Egret at Athi Dam, soon to die and hang from an<br />
acacia. It has a large amount of what looks like sisal material or<br />
similar wrapped all around its feet. In the evening it will fly to<br />
roost in an acacia, the sisal will become caught up on the thorns and<br />
barbs. The bird will flap to take off but be held tight by the<br />
entangled fibres. It will become exhausted as there is no escape and<br />
too weak to perch it will just hang from the branch and suffer a slow<br />
painful death. Something has to be done about this fibre hazard which<br />
is getting more and more frequent.<br />
<br />
BOTOM ROW FAR RIGHT<br />
LION<br />
This male is called something like Irakwa and is three years old. It<br />
was walking down the road above Athi Basin with an entourage of three<br />
cars, but as we were coming from the opposite direction stepped to the<br />
side of the road. The image was taken through the windscreen.<br />
