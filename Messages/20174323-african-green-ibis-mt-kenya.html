  <hr/>
  <p>Dear All</p><p><br></p><p>Yesterday while fishing in the dense forest on one of the streams on Mt Kenya I was lucky enough to walk in to an African green ibis... Best thing was that it flew in to a tree above me and sat there for 10 minutes calling!! I have always wanted to see one of these and am not sure when the last siting was, so thought I&#39;d post it here for interest.</p><p><br></p><p>Typically the one day that I got this rare opportunity I didn&#39;t have my proper camera with me... And it was posing perfectly teasing me... However the two images below taken on my phone show the crest and also the cheek markings - if you look closely!</p><p><br></p><p>A number of African emerald cuckoos were calling in the same area.</p><p><br></p><p>Kieran</p>
