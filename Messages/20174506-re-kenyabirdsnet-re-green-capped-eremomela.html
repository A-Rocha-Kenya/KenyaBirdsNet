&gt; Dear Nigel,  This is indeed a fantastic record of the little known
&gt; endemic race kikuyuensis, which Van Someren collected from Nairobi
&gt; (believed the western suburbs) in November 1916, but did not describe
&gt; it until 1931. It is very localized in the Thika, Embu and Meru
&gt; districts, but has not been recorded from Nairobi for a very very
&gt; long time, in fact I doubt there are any dated records.    Well worth
&gt; writing up for Scopus.
&gt;
&gt; Great news
