  <pre>ISN’T THIS A BLACK-EARED KITE Mivus lineatus?

There had been many Milvus kites about today, and they are very
variable with both Yellow-billed and Black present and in all ages.
In the late afternoon, Nigel Hunter and myself were at the vlei not
far from Langata Gate, there were a few Kites coming over from the
direction of the Galleria, and I saw something that looked very
different. I said to Nigel that there was a dark Kite flying over, but
the strangest things was that it had striking white crescents at the
bases of the the primary undersides. It was quite unlike anything I
had seen before in Africa and the pattern was more like a Common
Buzzard than a Kite.

It circled around a couple of times then disappeared over the forest
but not before I had managed to get a couple of shots, although at the
time I did not realise that I had managed anything useful.
