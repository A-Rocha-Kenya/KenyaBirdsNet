  <div dir="ltr"><div><div><div><div><div><div>Dear All,<br><br></div>Please find attached images of Blue Swallows that I located in the Mara Conservancy (aka Mara Triangle) this morning.<br><br></div>First, a male with long streamers was seen briefly then another with short streamers. Then a female-type and then more down the same track. I estimate that there were at least 10 birds in total, incuding two males with long streamers. <br><br></div>As the images show, these birds are looking tatty and just about ready to moult.<br><br></div>Please contact me directly should you require any additional information about their location.<br><br></div><div>At least five Grey-rumped Swallows were also present; such tiny swallows that were dwarfed by the Barn Swallows nearby.<br></div><div><br></div>Very best for now,<br></div>Adam<br></div>
