  <pre>Greetings birders

Nature Kenya&#39;s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk started slowly at the Racecourse
on the edge of Ngong Road Forest this week, but ended up producing exciting
records. Highlights included:

A pair of Crowned Eagles near the nest they have used for many years.

Highland forest birds that live in the Ngong Road Forest but are hard to
see, namely Brown-chested Alethe and Yellow-whiskered Greenbul (seen but not
heard!), and highland birds such as Northern Double-collared Sunbird and
Golden-breasted Bunting.

Unexpected dryland birds included Cinnamon-chested Rock Bunting and
Black-faced Waxbill.

Northern migrants were Eurasian Bee-eaters, Isabelline Shrike, Common
Whitethroat, Northern Wheatear, Spotted Flycatcher and Yellow Wagtail.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
