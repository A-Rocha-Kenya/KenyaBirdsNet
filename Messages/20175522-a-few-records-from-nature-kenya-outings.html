  <pre>A few records from recent Nature Kenya outings:

Feb 15, Langata: Crowned Eagle flying and calling over the houses and
gardens near the Langata Gate of Nairobi National Park.

Feb 19, Makuyu (beyond Thika): Flock of Hinde&#39;s Babblers, including one bird
showing a lot of white. Also a White-backed Vulture overhead and a singing
Brown-backed Scrub Robin.

Feb 22, Windsor Golf Hotel and Country Club: Two Green-backed Twinspots!

Thanks to all for your hospitality,

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
