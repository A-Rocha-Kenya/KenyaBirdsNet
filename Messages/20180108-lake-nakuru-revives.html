  <pre>Happy new year birders

The annual waterfowl census got off to a great start in 2018, counting Lake
Nakuru over the weekend. Thanks to NMK, KWS, AFEW and Nature Kenya.

The north end of the lake still looks like another world, with part of the
acacia woodland flooded ­ standing dead trees in the water and fallen dead
trees on the land. A wide variety of water birds, including African Darters
and Squacco Herons (and land birds such as parrots, rollers, woodpeckers,
oxpeckers) were making use of this habitat.

At the old gate, now at the water&#39;s edge, our group was fortunate to see an
African Hobby perched in a tall acacia, showing its all-rufous underparts.

In the afternoon we drove to the southern shore of Lake Nakuru near Muya&#39;s
Causeway ­ and ahhh....this was Lake Nakuru like &#34;the old days&#34;!!

Thousands of Greater and Lesser Flamingos, brilliant in the golden afternoon
light; Great White Pelicans, including a brown immature, fishing together; a
family of Pink-backed Pelicans in breeding plumage, with black &#34;eye make-up&#34;
and a little dark crest, also with an immature; a line of African Spoonbills
fishing intensively behind the pelicans; rows of silvery gulls and terns on
a sandbar; African Darters with wings spread out; Pied Avocets and
Black-winged Stilts foraging in the shallows; and more, more.

Greater Flamingos still outnumbered Lessers, and both flocks included
greyish immatures. Some of the Greater Flamingos were mating.

Highlight of the day, for me: a small flock (10-12) of African Skimmers,
also with an immature, flying right in front of us, slicing through the
water with their brilliant red beaks.

No wonder we got back to Nairobi rather late, through the dreadful traffic.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
