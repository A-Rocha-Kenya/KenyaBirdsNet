    <p>Bird atlassing using the BirdLasser app is amazing. Last week we
      birded a pentad covering the southern end of Arabuko-Sokoke Forest
      and then headed to a pentad (atlas square) on the coastline
      immediately to the east of the forest - the pentad only includes a
      corner, more or less, of land, the rest is ocean.</p>
    <p>What was amazing was how using the BirdLasser app encourages you
      to find tracks and trails to lead you to what look like
      interesting patches of habitat within the pentad on the satellite
      image. After an early start in the forest before 6am and picking
      up East Coast Akalat, Amani Sunbird and Sokoke Pipit among other
      forest specialists (tho' no Green-headed Oriole despite being in
      the area it has been known from in ASF...), we headed for the Roka
      pools - old gypsum mines that are flooded and form a 'miniature
      Lake Elementaita' almost of soda-water type pools. Here you get
      Black-winged Stilts and sometimes flamingo - though on Thursday we
      hit it right for the tide and found large roosting flocks of sand
      plovers and sandpipers - including several colour-flagged Greater
      Sand Plover that we would have ringed on Mida Creek 3+ years ago!
      This is proof that they come from Mida to roost here... the major
      highlight, however, was three Red-necked Phalarope giving the most
      incredible views only a matter of 40 m away!</p>
    <p>From there we headed farther east into pentad no. 0325_3955 -
      which was 100% transformed habitat: coconut plantation, degraded
      agricultural land with not a lot growing on it and old coral rag
      quarries (for building blocks) that were now very overgrown. None
      of what must have been an incredible forest many years ago... BUT,
      despite this paucity of 'good' habitat, we still managed to use
      BirdLasser to find a track leading to the coastline and while we
      had to walk the last 1-2 km, we picked up such goodies as Bohm's
      Spinetail (again, the best views I've ever had of them - cruising
      around only a few m away at eye-level over degraded scrubby
      habitat - while I'm used to seeing them high overhead over the
      forest canopy), Rufous Scrub Robins (i.e. Rufous Bush Chat) all
      over the place and an Isabelline Shrike (or rather Turkestan
      Shrike as it should probably be called now of the form <i>karelini</i>
      - very grey with little rufous). It also led us to a gorgeous
      little beach below a cliff surrounded by rock pools - a great
      place to come visit with the family some time (and I'd <i>never</i>
      have found it had it not been for atlassing...). <br>
    </p>
    <p>Saturday was then time for waterbird counts linked to the
      museum-coordinated counts in the Rift Valley. We did Lake Jilore
      (NW corner of the forest), Malindi Harbour and Kensalt saltworks
      north of Gongoni... And atlassing at the same time produced some
      good birds. Highlights included (L. Jilore) 104 Abdim's Stork, 4
      Garganey, 1 Black-tailed Godwit, several Common Snipe, a White
      Wagtail, Collared Pratincoles, several Sprossers (Thrush
      Nightingale) were doing short bursts of sub-song in the bush on
      the hillside and we heard and recorded a Great Reed Warbler
      singing as well before flushing a roosting Slender-tailed
      Nightjar.Â  Brown and Black-chested Snake Eagles, Wahlberg's Eagle,
      Black-shouldered Kite and Western Marsh Harrier contributed to a
      total of 75 species which was very acceptable for the three hours
      in the one spot. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Amazingly, while we looked out and even searched specifically for
      them while driving through the villages we didn't see a single
      House Crow - interesting given the huge numbers there are in the
      urban centres and exactly why we need to do atlassing across the
      whole coastline to really get a good picture of actual
      distribution and abundance rather than simply assumed.</p>
    <p>We're up to 75 cards submitted so far this year and 50 pentads
      which is a great start to the year - if you're not involved in
      atlassing and a birder, please do join us in what is going to be
      the most critical project for bird conservation over the next
      decade or more.</p>
