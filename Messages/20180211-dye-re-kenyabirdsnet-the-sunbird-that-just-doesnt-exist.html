  Hi Brian,<div><br></div><div>Strange Sunbird indeed.<br><div><br></div><div>This is only a hunch, but to my mind the mottled/color smear appearance of the bird&#39;s flanks and side of breast suggest the bird might have encountered a dye or solvent.   At first I wondered if it might be a disheveled molting bird but the color smears may affect individual feathers - the next to rightmost photo in the bottom row of your montage has very strange color patterns and swirls.</div><div><br></div><div>What if it is a Variable Sunbird that got into purple dye?   (improbable though it may sound)</div><div><br></div><div>Good Birding,</div><div><br></div><div>Nate<br><br>On Saturday, February 10, 2018, Brian Finch <a href="mailto:birdfinch@gmail.com" target="_blank">birdfinch@gmail.com</a> [kenyabirdsnet] &lt;<a href="mailto:kenyabirdsnet-noreply@yahoogroups.com" target="_blank">kenyabirdsnet-noreply@<wbr>yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex">

      <p>THE SUNBIRD THAT JUST DOESN’T EXIST.<br>
<br>
Today Nigel Hunter and myself had wonderful views of very obliging<br>
sunbirds that were coming in to bathe in recently sprayed acacias in<br>
the native tree nursery near East Gate in Nairobi National Park. They<br>
were fluttering in the leaves only a couple of feet from the ground<br>
enjoying their bathe. This was drawing in Bronze, Marico and Variable<br>
Sunbirds, and more surprisingly a few Buff-bellied Warblers.<br>
<br>
When I first drew attention to one particular bird I said to Nigel<br>
that I was watching a bird that could not possibly exist, and when he<br>
found the bird he could see exactly what I meant.<br>
<br>
I took a number of photographs and some video (images and video-grabs<br>
attached).<br>
<br>
The description of the bird is as follows:<br>
<br>
Overall a robust, not small sunbird with a strong bill<br>
<br>
Head; almost entirely violet-blue and very shiny. Appearing darker on<br>
crown and the face forward from the eye. This continued onto the<br>
breast, and on the side of this, whilst most of the time looking as<br>
blue as head and back, at certain angles showed limited greenish tinge<br>
to the iridescence.<br>
<br>
Back; the same violet blue continued across the entire upperparts,<br>
with the flight feathers non-iridescent blackish-grey. The rump like<br>
the back was violet-blue, but the tail dull blackish-grey like the<br>
wings in most lights but what was not easy to see was that at the<br>
right angle it appeared tinged iridescent green.<br>
<br>
The lower-breast towards the vent was a creamy-grey, there was a<br>
flame-orange pectoral tuft that showed readily in flight, and on the<br>
closed wing appeared as an orange and yellow pectoral patch extending<br>
onto the sides of the breast as a short maroon line but this did not<br>
extend onto the breast.<br>
<br>
Legs and feet very blackish.<br>
<br>
Is there anybody out there who could give some suggestions as to what<br>
this bird might be?<br>
<br>
Best for now<br>
Brian<br>
