DISTURBING NEWS FROM NNP ....

so very sad that KWS can let themselves and what they stand for down
so badly, that this Government has no regard for the laws and the
constitution of this country and that the Chinese are destroying
everything they lay their hands on.
We have just received an alert that work on SGR Phase 2A has started
within the boundaries of Nairobi National Park. Reports are coming in
that about 40 workers with heavy machinery have started work near the
embankment close to east gate and a construction camp that was set up
last week. The area is heavily guarded by KWS rangers who are now not
allowing anyone to get close.
If these works are related to SGR Phase 2A, they are in contravention
of the STOP ORDER currently in place as well as ongoing contempt of
court proceedings. Either way, these works are in violation of EMCA
and the WCMA and must be stopped immediately.
Please share widely. Send messages, tweets etc to NEMA, Ministry of
Tourism and Wildlife, Forest and Natural Resources, KRC, etc to stop
this ongoing travesty.

Please assist with spreading the news of this horrendous situation by
broadcasting on every media format at your disposal so that it goes
around the entire world at least twice a day and causes maximum
adverse media publicity and shames the Kenya Government as well as the
Chinese Government.
