      <p>Dear All,<br>
Sorry for the delay in coming back on the issue of the strange Sunbird<br>
from the nursery near East Gate in NNP, and thanks so much to all<br>
those who lent their ideas on the ID and I will go all through these<br>
later.<br>
<br>
Firstly we have to look at the features on the bird.<br>
<br>
1.	Glossy bluish upperparts reflecting green at different angles.<br>
2.	Fairly stoutish bill.<br>
3.	Greener on breast.<br>
4.	Indication of maroon on sides of collar.<br>
5.	Bright orange pectoral tufts.<br>
6.	Greyish olive-yellow lower belly.<br>
7.	Bird appears in transition moult.<br>
<br>
The contenders…. Males of Variable and Marico Sunbirds.<br>
<br>
1.	Marico is very green above not showing any deep blue iridescence.<br>
Variable is green above with a blue iridescence but never deep blue.<br>
<br>
2.	Marico has a comparably stout bill.<br>
Variable has a shorter and weaker bill.<br>
<br>
3.	Marico has a green breast with blue iridescence.<br>
Variable has a bluer breast with purple iridescence and pectoral band.<br>
<br>
4.	Marico has a maroon collar across the breast.<br>
Variable has a blue-purple lower edge to breast.<br>
<br>
5.	Marico has no pectoral tufts whatsoever.<br>
Variable has orange-yellow pectoral tufts.<br>
<br>
6/7. Marico has greyish olive-yellow belly before moulting into adult plumage.<br>
Variable has uniform pale-yellow to bright yellow belly.<br>
<br>
In the unlikely option of a hybrid between the two, the plumage is<br>
looking too “clean” to support a mixture of genes. The dominant deep<br>
blue colour occurs on neither species, and would not result if the<br>
colours were mixed.<br>
<br>
The options that came in; were an accident having fallen into a<br>
chemical. If this had happened, for the bird to be entirely changed<br>
with a chemical colouring, it would have had to have been totally<br>
immersed, including eyes and nostrils, and the chance of a bird being<br>
100% covered in a chemical, the feathers would have become matted, and<br>
such an incident would not permit survival. This bird was hyperactive<br>
and very healthy. The feathers were clean and lustrous.<br>
<br>
That Variable is called Variable because that is what it is. True, but<br>
it only affects the breast from white, through to yellow, bright<br>
yellow and rich orange-yellow below the breast. Even an aberration<br>
couldn’t explain the maroon on the sides of the chest, or the rather<br>
stout bill.<br>
<br>
An aberrant Marico. Even with the colour shift, there has to be<br>
something else to give it yellow pectoral tufts, which are never found<br>
on Marico.<br>
<br>
Moulting Tacazze. We had Bronze Sunbird bathing with it, and it was<br>
much larger, and of course Tacazze is much the same size and build as<br>
Bronze. With regards to the maroon on the breast, it is only in the<br>
area of a pectoral band, if it were anything to do with the Tacazze’s<br>
magenta coming through it would be expected elsewhere on the<br>
underparts, and it allows for a large colour shift on the upperparts,<br>
and of course does not explain the yellow pectoral tufts.<br>
<br>
So I went through every possibility in East Africa and came up with<br>
nothing, then increased the search throughout sub-saharan Africa again<br>
a blank. Then I looked up any purplish Sunbirds from the rest of the<br>
old world.<br>
It’s really exciting finding interesting things but when you think you<br>
know the answer you can look really stupid.<br>
There is a species that fulfils all points 1-7 seen on the bird, and<br>
that is the Purple Sunbird of India. If you look at the bottom row of<br>
the sunbird plate, apart from the farthest right which is the East<br>
Gate Nursery Sunbird, this is the male Purple Sunbird.<br>
<br>
IF there is a possibility that this is a Purple Sunbird, it would have<br>
to be an escapee brought in by a home-sick Indian. So whilst this<br>
might seem ridiculous, an Indian Sunbird species being found in Kenya,<br>
there is a sting in the tail on the Sunbird Plate, the nice image of<br>
the Variable Sunbird was recently photographed in Gir National Park,<br>
Gujurati, India!!!<br>
<br>
Best to all<br>
