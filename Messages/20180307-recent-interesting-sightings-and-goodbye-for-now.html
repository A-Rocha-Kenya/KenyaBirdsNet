  <p><span>Hello,</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p>I wanted to share some recent interesting birds seen in and around Nairobi, and at Naivasha on Feb 5th.</p><p><br></p><p>The University of Nairobi Kabete campus continued to be very productive throughout January. &nbsp;I photographed a Scaly-throated Honeyguide on January 13th (list and pic here&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S41863765">https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S41863765</a>), upstream or the dam where the University has been removing Cypress, Jacaranda and other mature exotics. &nbsp;A number of bees nests had been found, and seemed to be attracting quite a few honeyguides. &nbsp; On the same morning I found two Pale Flycatchers along the edge of the coffee/macadamia north of Loresho Ridge (list and pics here:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S41863773">https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S41863773</a>). &nbsp;Sidney Shema tells me he has seen them frequently in the same area. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>January 30th I visited Karura forest with Daniel Carrollo and another friend. &nbsp;We paused at the swamp next to KFEET/River Cafe, where the track crosses the stream. &nbsp;A Red-chested Flufftail began to call from a few metres away. &nbsp;We listened for a few minutes, played some tape, to which it responded. &nbsp;A few minutes later it called from very close, &nbsp;but despite us being almost &quot;on top of it&quot; we didn&#39;t catch a glance. &nbsp;David Guranieri visited that afternoon and got a nice recording of two birds, here:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S42363567">https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S42363567</a>. &nbsp; We have both heard one of the birds on more recent visits. &nbsp; This species was reported close-by, upstream in the UN Nature Trail, by Rory Neft in November 2014, recording here:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.xeno-canto.org/201216">https://www.xeno-canto.org/201216</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>Feb 5th Ben Mugambi and I visited Naivasha, searching for &nbsp;year at least, appear to be very scarce migrant duck. &nbsp;Eight Northern Pintail were the only Palearctic spp we found, in the bay between Crescent Island and Lake Naivasha Country Club. &nbsp; However, we did observe a Caspian Tern from the northern end of Crescent Island (list and pics here:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S42514510" style="word-spacing:normal;">https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S42514510</a>) as well as about 30 Lesser Black-backed Gulls. &nbsp;On reviewing my photos, I noticed a larger gull (gull spp on the list - bird on the left, with Grey-headed and LB-B gulls conveniently close for comparison). &nbsp;I wonder if this might be Heuglin&#39;s Gull, or just a trick of perspective. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>My posting in Kenya is sadly at an end, so it&#39;s Kwaheri for now, but Tutaonana some time next year. &nbsp;I&#39;ve enjoyed immensely the opportunities I have had to interact with members of Nature Kenya on the waterbird counts and Sunday potlucks, and to the many guides and individuals who have shared their knowledge and passion for Kenya&#39;s birds, fauna and flora. &nbsp;Gloria and I will be based in southern Ontario, within striking distance of Long Point, Point Pelee and Coot&#39;s Paradise. &nbsp;Do keep in touch! &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Best to all,</p><p><br></p><p>Simon</p>
