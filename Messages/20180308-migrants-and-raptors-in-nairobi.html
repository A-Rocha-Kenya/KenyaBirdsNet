  <pre>Greetings birders

It was an exciting Wednesday Morning Birdwalk at the Racecourse and Ngong
Road Forest Sanctuary on 7 March after five days of unexpected rain.
Everything was green, the fig trees were beginning to fruit and the Trema
trees were full of fruit and birds. The first birds we recorded were African
Green Pigeons.

Migratory birds included Common Sandpiper, Eurasian Bee-eater, Willow
Warbler, Blackcap, Garden Warbler, Common Whitethroat, Northern Wheatear,
Common Rock Thrush and Spotted Flycatcher.

At the Nairobi National Museums grounds on a very hot and dry February 28,
there was a Common Nightingale, but the day&#39;s highlights were the raptors:

Lanner Falcon, Black Kite, African Harrier Hawk, August Buzzard, Great
Sparrowhawk, Ayres&#39;s Hawk Eagle and Long-crested Eagle.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
