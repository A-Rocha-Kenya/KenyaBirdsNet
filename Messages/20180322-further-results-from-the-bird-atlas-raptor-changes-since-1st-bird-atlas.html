    <p>We're at the 24th Fundamentals of Ornithology Course in Naivasha
      enjoying some wet weather and dozens of Willow Warblers - almost
      2-3 in every tree, hundreds of Barn Swallows and many Sand
      Martins, House Martins among the migrants passing through - and 8
      Steppe Buzzards high and heading north 3 days ago. We have been
      atlassing and teaching participants how to use BirdLasser - but
      today we looked at some of the results from the atlas so far and
      especially changes in distribution since the first bird atlas
      (published 1989). <br>
    </p>
    <p>So we have gone back to the first atlas, dug out the map of some
      species and compared with the current bird atlas coverage - and
      got a serious shock at the reality of what the <i>data</i> is
      saying. i.e. we all 'know' that certain species, especially
      raptors, have declined over recent times - but nothing beats
      actual <i>data</i> from shouting loudly what is going on - and
      especially <i>visual</i> results... like a map. <br>
    </p>
    <p> We are working to get the first atlas maps up on the <a
        moz-do-not-send="true" href="http://kenyabirdmap.adu.org.za/">Kenya
        Bird Map</a> website - which will be hugely useful for showing
      this and as a tool for conservation, but in the meantime here are
      some scans from the first atlas and what the current coverage
      shows:</p>
    <p>First, how much of Kenya has been covered by those of you who
      have done an awesome job at playing a part in collecting these
      records? Coverage for Full Protocol cards (ad hoc records are not
      shown on the coverage map) currently stands at:</p>
    <p><img src="cid:part2.70866ED3.C9FCDE85@arocha.org" alt="" class=""
        height="430" width="359"></p>
    <p>...so a good part of central Kenya, the Rift, the coast and a
      reasonable scattering of pentads across western Kenya have been
      covered pretty well. Thus at least for these areas, if the birds
      are there, then we can be pretty sure they would have been picked
      up. Now to some comparisons:</p>
    <p><a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="http://kenyabirdmap.adu.org.za/species_info.php?spp=107#menu_left">African
        White-backed Vulture</a>: (link takes you to the species map in
      the Kenya Bird Map)<br>
    </p>
    <p>in the 1970s and early 1980s on the left (large black squares are
      confirmed breeding, small black squares are confirmed presence;
      grey means historical records - i.e. pre-1975) and as at 21st
      March 2018 on the right (red and pink = high reporting rate,
      yellow = very low reporting rate; grey = single record or less
      than 4 full Protocol cards submitted):<br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="cid:part4.A9F078EB.986CB884@arocha.org" alt="" class=""
        height="456" width="426"> <img
        src="cid:part5.2CBD7050.2E9A800A@arocha.org" alt="" class=""></p>
    <p>We all know about the Egyptian Vulture population having declined
      hugely but look at this! In the '70s and '80s African White-backed
      Vultures were right across the country - breeding in many places.
      Only in western Kenya nearer to Kisumu was there a suggestion of a
      decline (the small grey squares) which would make sense since
      human population and agriculture spread sooner on that side of the
      country. Today, of the areas that have been covered, it is almost
      only Mara, the Athi-Kapiti plains and a few scattered places also
      mostly tied to protected areas that White-backs are found...</p>
    <p><a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="http://kenyabirdmap.adu.org.za/species_info.php?spp=111#menu_left">Egyptian
        Vulture</a>:</p>
    <p><img src="cid:part7.B722FD23.729F01B9@arocha.org" alt="" class=""
        height="458" width="434"> <img
        src="cid:part8.89BEF2C7.1DA4BA07@arocha.org" alt="" class=""></p>
    <p>A well-known decline - BUT when you SEE the change in
      distribution, it is truly shocking. Today, in the past four years
      of atlassing, there have only been a handful of records submitted
      despite there being reasonable coverage (see above). <br>
    </p>
    <p><a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="http://kenyabirdmap.adu.org.za/species_info.php?spp=108#menu_left">Lappet-faced
        Vulture</a>:</p>
    <p><img src="cid:part10.DDE64A2D.85C00520@arocha.org" alt=""
        class="" height="468" width="430"> <img
        src="cid:part11.75740A7E.A7EA6BD0@arocha.org" alt="" class=""></p>
    <p>...again a massive contraction in range - only in Mara, Amboseli,
      Nairobi National Park and Tsavo East are there any level of
      reporting rate. For the rest of the country where records have
      been submitted - gone.</p>
    <p>And the story goes on. These results are critical for us as we
      seek to address issues of poisoning, maintaining protected areas
      etc. Hard data cannot be beaten - especially when collected
      following a tight and proven protocol. But we can only fight the
      problems if we get the data in. As can be seen from the coverage
      map, there are still large gaps - and for best results regular and
      repeated coverage of pentads generates a solid understanding of
      what is going on in a species. <br>
    </p>
    <p>There are a good number of skilled birders whose records would
      make a significant contribution to the bird atlas and to Kenyan
      conservation and research. If you have not yet joined the growing
      team of atlassers in Kenya, can I urge you to do so? Contributing
      to eBird etc is great but unfortunately as eBird does not insist
      on a tight protocol tied to set locations, data from eBird cannot
      be simply imported to the Kenya Bird Map and even then could not
      be used for Full Protocol card analysis (reporting rate etc), only
      distribution - however, the other way round is very possible and
      indeed, BirdLasser now allows you to export your BirdLasser data
      to your eBird profile. <br>
    </p>
    <p>These KBM maps are immediately available online and the basic
      data can be downloaded for free (see link below the maps on the
      species page) and we are working on developing more tools for
      analysis online direct from the website (watch this space!). <br>
    </p>
    <p>It is awesome to see how my and your records can contribute
      immediately to our knowledge of birds and to conservation so
      directly - as you submit your record of Egyptian Vulture and it is
      vetted and accepted, the species distribution map is updated real
      time. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Thanks again to all those who have contributed - keep it up!</p>
