  <p><span>Hi all</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>I was in Kiwaiyu last week and was amazed to see a Greater Frigatebird flying just offshore... It took me by surprise! I looked at the book and saw that it is not a common bird to see off the Kenyan coast so thought it was worth posting on here for the record.</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>Thanks</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>Kieran</span></p>
