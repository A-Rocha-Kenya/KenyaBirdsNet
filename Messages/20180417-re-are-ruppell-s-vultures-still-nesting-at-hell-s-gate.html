  <pre>Dear All.  Ruppell’s are still breeding on the cliffs in Hell’s Gate NP in varying numbers from 10-30 pairs.

Meanwhile I have recently had the opportunity to look at a number of cliff faces in northern Kenya, and was pleasantly surprised to see numbers of Ruppell’s nesting on nearly all cliff faces north of Archer’s Post, with good numbers on Ol Kanjao, Bodeck and Ololokwe.
