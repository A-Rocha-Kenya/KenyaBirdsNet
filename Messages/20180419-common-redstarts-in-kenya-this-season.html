  <pre>Dear All,
On Oct 13th 2017 I videoed a female Redstart in this garden. There
have only been three records in Kenya this season, that one which was
the second only for Nairobi, the first being a spring male in NNP I
found end of last century so where were the other two... this week in
Nigel Hunter&#39;s garden and another in Terry Stevenson&#39;s garden. If
three records can all end up in birders gardens surely some birds must
also be in the wilderness, or even non-birders gardens! Are there any
more records out there we don&#39;t know about?
Best for now
Brian
