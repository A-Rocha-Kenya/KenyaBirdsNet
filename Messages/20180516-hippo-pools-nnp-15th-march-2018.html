  <pre>Dear All,
I have just been passed the attached images of the metal bridge over
the Mbagathi at Hippo Pools, they are very impressive! People familiar
with the bridge and knowing how high above the normal water level it
is, will appreciate the volume of water that is currently crashing
down the Mbagathi. The photos were taken by by Nickson Parmisa. I
wonder if he got his feet wet!
Best
Brian
