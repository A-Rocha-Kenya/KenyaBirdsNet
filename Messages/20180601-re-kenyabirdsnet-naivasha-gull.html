  <pre>Dear All,
There is one difference between the two birds, but could be age
related, Afam&#39;s bird has a pale eye with a very narrow red eye-ring,
from what I see of the current gull although a bit blurred and
possibly a camera artifact is that it appears all dark but comes out
reddish,
I think the gulls are probably not the same as although this is a
complex group the pale eye should suggest the older bird,
There is still no conclusive evidence of a Heuglin&#39;s Gull inland,
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Hi Adam,
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for sharing this and, one has to wonder if it is the same
&gt; individual?
&gt;
&gt; Both birds certainly look like plausible candidates for barabensis.
&gt;
&gt; Best Wishes,

&gt;&gt; Thanks for this James.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The bird looks almost identical to the one I saw at the same location in
&gt;&gt; May 2013 - see images attached.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Best,

&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear Birders,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Just a quick heads-up to anyone who might be at Naivasha or heading that
&gt;&gt;&gt; way.... A large grey-backed gull species was photographed there on May
&gt;&gt;&gt; 20th
&gt;&gt;&gt; and is currently thought most likely to be a Caspian Gull or a Steppe
&gt;&gt;&gt; Gull.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The bird was on Crescent Island and it&#39;s possible it&#39;s still there.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Please
&gt;&gt;&gt; keep an eye out for it if you happen to be on the lake as further photos
&gt;&gt;&gt; and notes could be useful. The original photos can be seen here:
