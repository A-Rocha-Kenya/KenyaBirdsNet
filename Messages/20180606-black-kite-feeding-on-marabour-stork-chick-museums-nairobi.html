  <hr/>
  I have been observing birds in Nairobi, more focus on all breeding and Silvery-cheecked Hornbill. Its very interesting how this birds live. In 2016 Marabou Stork visited Acacia tree opposite Museum gate on Kipande road build three incomplete nests and then disappear. Last year 2017 in may they came back to same tree add more nests and breed successful, they have bred three times since they begin, y<span style="word-spacing:normal;">esterday we observe Black Kite feeding on one of the chicks hatched two weeks ago. This incident is just one of the many things we might not be aware about this species who have decided to be urban bird.</span><div><span style="word-spacing:normal;"><br></span></div><div>with&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks</div><div><br></div><div>Chesire</div>
