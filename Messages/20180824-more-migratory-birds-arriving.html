  <pre>Greetings birders

Nature Kenyaâ€™s Sunday Birdwatch visited Lukenya Hill and environs on November 18, by kind courtesy of Lukenya Getaway and Dr David Kasanga. Highlights included:

Black Stork flying over
Secretarybird
Common (Steppe) Buzzard
Three-banded Plover with two tiny chicks
Great Spotted Cuckoo - at least two adults
Migratory land birds including Eurasian Golden Oriole, Isabelline Shrike, Barn Swallow, Willow Warbler, Common Whitethroat, Northern, Isabelline and Pied Wheatears, Common Rock Thrush, Thrush Nightingale (Sprosser) and Tree Pipit.
Cape Wagtail

On November 21 at daybreak my garden was full of Nightingales, but they then moved on.

November 22 an Olivaceous Warbler was pumping its tail up and down in Nairobi National Park.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
