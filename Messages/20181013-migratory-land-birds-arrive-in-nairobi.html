  <pre>Greetings birders

At the Ngong Road Racecourse on 10 October, Nature Kenya’s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk finally recorded some migratory land birds:

Eurasian Bee-eater, Common Swift, Barn Swallow and Willow Warbler (at last!)

Birds of prey were also prominent, including Crowned Eagle and Ayres’s Hawk Eagle. The young Crowned Eagle seems to have left the nest.

Wishing you a fruitful World Migratory Bird Day,

Fleur
