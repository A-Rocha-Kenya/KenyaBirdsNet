  <pre>Greetings birders

Nature Kenya’s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk had two exciting mornings recently:

At the University of Nairobi’s Agricultural Field Station in Kabete on 31 October, we saw Little Bittern and Red-throated Wryneck, but only heard the Hinde’s Babblers.

At Paradise Lost on November 7, we recorded White-backed Duck, a pale phase Wahlberg’s Eagle, Lesser Moorhen, a pair of Grey Crowned Cranes with a nearly-grown young, Common Sandpiper, Eurasian Bee-eater, Willow Warbler, Spotted Flycatcher, Eastern (African) Golden Weaver and some 75 other species.

And on a visit to Nairobi National Park with James Kashangaki and Jennifer Oduori on November 4, we found many White-backed Vultures, a Blue-cheeked Bee-eater at Athi Dam and a friendly Common Nightingale at the Greenline tree nursery.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
