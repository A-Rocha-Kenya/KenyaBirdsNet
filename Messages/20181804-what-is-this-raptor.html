  <div dir="ltr">Hi birders,<br><br>Kindly help ID this raptor seen today while bird mapping in the Rift Valley between Mt Suswa and Ngong Hills, with Stephen Graham and James Kuria. The whitish flight feathers directed our thoughts to Brown Snake Eagle, but the pale unbarred tail doesn&#39;t seem right for that species. The feet also look yellow (zoom in to the flight image), which would disqualify BSE. Rather broad/rounded wings and a shortish fanned tail suggest a Buteo buzzard. The head also seems more like that of a buzzard than a snake eagle. Could this be a juvenile dark morph Common Buzzard (see <a href="http://orientalbirdimages.org/search.php?Bird_ID=913&amp;Bird_Image_ID=35812&amp;p=85">this image</a> for comparison)? Or maybe something else entirely? The bird was rather large and robust, which is another reason we thought of an eagle initially. Will be glad to hear your opinions.<br><br>Sidney</div>
