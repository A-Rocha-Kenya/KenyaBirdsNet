  <pre>Hi Sidney,
The male is consistently at his old nest site along the Nagalomon
River in Kisembe Forest, but as you say never a female, and I think
you are right. About four months ago there was an immature around Athi
Dam, but presumably a wanderer.
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Hi birders,
&gt;
&gt; I was in the park on Saturday with Marco Pruiksma, Jennifer Oduori and
&gt; Fleur
&gt; Ng&#39;weno for the Global Big Day. Among the birds seen were a handful of
&gt; Palearctic migrants - 3 Lesser Grey Shrikes, a Red-backed Shrike and a few
&gt; Barn Swallows. Black-shouldered Kites are now fairly common - a stark
&gt; contrast to the situation before the rains. A Jacobin Cuckoo near Hippo
&gt; Pools was also a nice sighting. Other cuckoos were Diederik, Klaas&#39;s,
&gt; Red-chested and African Emerald. Red-collared Widowbirds were all over the
&gt; plains while White-winged and Jackson&#39;s Widowbirds were only seen in the
&gt; south-western grasslands around Kingfisher. Yellow-crowned Bishops in
&gt; breeding plumage were busy displaying at the numerous seasonal marshes.
&gt; Black-crowned Night Herons, African Darters, Reed Cormorants and Sacred
&gt; Ibis are nesting in good numbers on their usual clump of trees at Nagolomon
&gt; Dam. Shorebirds in general were virtually absent from the park as there are
&gt; almost no &#39;shores&#39; on any of the dams.
&gt;
&gt; Something curious I&#39;ve noted is that every sighting of a Bateleur that I
&gt; have had in Nairobi National Park over the past couple of years has been of
&gt; a single adult male. No females at all. It&#39;s well known that a pair has
&gt; historically nested in the park for a long time but I wonder if the female
&gt; is now dead or has dispersed for some reason (or if it&#39;s just pure chance
&gt; that I keep seeing the male). Has anyone here seen a female Bateleur (or
&gt; even a juv/imm) in NNP or any nearby areas over the last 2 years or so?
&gt;
&gt; Best regards,
&gt; Sidney
