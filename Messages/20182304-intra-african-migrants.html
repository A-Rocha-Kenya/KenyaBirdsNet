  <pre>Greetings from Dakatcha Woodland Important Bird Area in Kilifi County

There’s been some rain here, and much of the landscape is green and full of flowers. Highlights today are the intra-African migrants:

Several Jacobin Cuckoos, some black and white and some all black (with white wing patches). Also a few Yellowbills.

Flocks of Magpie Starlings – just like the stunning photo by James Christian.

Wishing you good birding,

Fleur
