  <div dir="ltr">Hello All,<div><br></div><div>I went on recent trip to Sibiloi Dec 30-Jan 6. I was with a mostly fishing / non birding group but here are a few things I saw while in and just outside of the park. Non of these birds are very exceptional I don&#39;t think but I compiled a list since so few people get up there.  <div><br></div><div>On the way back to Marsabit about 35 km west I passed a small bunch of what i assumed were Myrmecocichla Chats.  Because I&#39;m still not totally familiar with all Kenyan Ranges I assumed as we passed that there were Sooty Chats.  The habitat was god forsaken - lava with only a bit of sad looking bush.  The convoy couldn&#39;t stop for the only bird nerd and as I said I assumed it was something that was supposed to be there.  When I finally got my book out I was able to determine that no Myrmecocichla should live there. The birds were in a small party of 3 or 4.  They had white patches on their coverts exposed very clearly when they landed.  There were also a very jet black.    </div><div><br></div><div>There is certainly the possibility that the Turkana sun had gotten to my head and I was seeing bird mirages but I thought it worth a note.  Should anyone be passing the area soon I will share the GPS point. </div><div><br></div><div>Here are the birds from Sibiloi:</div><div><div><br></div><div>White-crowned Starling (East of Entrance)</div><div>Somali Courser</div><div>Taita Fisca (possibly Somali but I didn&#39;t know to check)</div><div>Somali Bee-eater</div><div>Slender-tailed Nightjar (How odd that there is not a higher nightjar diversity in the area)</div><div>Crested Lark</div><div>Kori Bustard</div><div>Buff-crested Bustard</div><div>Heuglin&#39;s Bustard</div><div>20+ Swallow-tailed Kites</div><div>Eastern-chanting Goshawk</div><div>Bateleur</div><div>Lesser Kestrel</div><div>Parrot-billed Sparows</div><div>Verreaux&#39;s Eagle-owl</div><div>Little Swift </div><div>Blue-naped Mousebird</div><div>White-browed Scrub-robin</div><div>Easter Violet-backed Sunbird (also surprised there is not more sunbird diversity)</div><div>Fan-tailed Raven</div><div>Red-billed Quelea</div><div>Black-cheeked Waxbill</div><div>Goliath Heron</div><div>White-faced Whistling Duck</div><div>African Spoonbill</div><div>Glossy Ibis</div><div>Great cormorant </div><div>Long-tailed cormorant</div><div>Collared Pranticole</div><div>Yellow-billed Stork</div><div>Knob-billed Duck</div><div>Little Egret</div><div>Yellow-necked Spurfowl</div><div>Crested Francolin</div><div>Spur-winged Lapwing</div><div>Crowned Lapwing</div><div>Caspian Tern</div><div>White-winged Tern</div><div>Chestnut-bellied Sandgrouse</div><div>Lichtensteins Sandgrouse</div><div>Namaqua Dove</div><div>Ring-necked Dove</div><div>Speckled Pigeon</div><div><br></div><div><img src="cid:ii_jc4c9zao0_160cf18bf7f1a091" width="454" height="302"><br>​<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br clear="all"><div><br></div>-- <br><div class="gmail_signature" data-smartmail="gmail_signature"><div dir="ltr">James Christian<br>Karisia Walking Safaris<div><div>P.O Box 1716 - 10400,</div><div>Nanyuki, Kenya</div><div>Tel: +254 721371694</div><a href="http://www.karisia.com" target="_blank">http://www.karisia.com</a><br></div></div></div>
