  <pre>A brief update note on the bird atlas project for Kenya (and Africa). 
The Kenya Bird Map project is repeating the bird atlas that was 
published in 1989 but at a finer resolution and will certainly be the 
key bird conservation tool in future years. With 892 pentads (atlas 
squares) covered already in Kenya, we&#39;re well on the way to being able 
to build species distributions and with multiple submissions from the 
same pentad are able to start to get a picture of relative abundance.

A number of birders especially from overseas had started using eBird and 
so quite understandably have not wanted to now start using BirdLasser - 
the excellent app for collecting bird atlas data on the go - and thus 
not have those records included in their eBird profile.

BirdLasser have just released a new update for their app that will now 
allow you to export atlassing data to your eBird profile. This means 
that while eBird data is not tight enough to be able to import into the 
Bird Atlas database and be of any significant use, vice versa can work 
well - you can collect data on BirdLasser and import it to eBird.

If you are an eBird user and have not yet contributed to the Kenya Bird 
Map, why not consider being a part of building our local bird 
conservation initiative? With the new development in BirdLasser you also 
need not miss out on keeping your eBird records up to date.

I&#39;m cc&#39;ing this to Henk Nel who heads up BirdLasser for anyone who has 
any further questions about it.
