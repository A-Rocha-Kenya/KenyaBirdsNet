  <pre>Dear All,

I just signed the petition, “Citizens of the republic of
Kenya,International &amp; local Environmentalist, and Conservationists.:
Stop human rights abuse, Ecosystem interference by the S.G.R, project
in Kenya..” I think this is important. Will you sign it too?

Please take time to read the reason for this petition and absorb what
it entails, then decide on which side of the railway line you are
standing!

Here’s the link:

Thanks,
