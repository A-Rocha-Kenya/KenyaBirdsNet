Dear All,
With Nigel Hunter. The cold season is well and truly with us, and this
is the result after a days birding in the Park. It’s a bit abbreviated
but I wanted to get the species recorded before I forget it. It seemed
a very slow and uncomfortably cool day and but we managed to get to
most places, including all were recently unreachable because of
flooding. What amazed us was that we recorded 179 species, making it
the highest species total for a July day!

Harlequin Quail
Just one bird flushed, although conditions look good for numbers

White-faced Whistling Duck
Two on Karen PS Dam only waterfowl apart from Egyptian Geese.

African Spoonbill
At least eight birds and five nests with birds incubating Nagalomon Dam.

Black-crowned Night Heron
Thirty birds at Nagalomon Dam included the first locally raised
juveniles for the season.

Striated Heron
One bird along the Mbagathi.

Pink-backed Pelican
One at Athi Dam.

Long-tailed Cormorant
A few pairs nesting at Nagalomon Dam, but difficult to see most nests.

Singles along the Mbagathi and vlei near Langata Gate, my first
returning birds this season.

White-winged Black Tern
An adult in non-breeding dress at Athi Dam would be very early for a
migrant, also no sign of breeding plumage and probably represents a
bird that did not return north this year.

One very tame male in the same place as seen a few occasions in the
past, on the road between the Mbagathi and Athi Dam.

Yellow-throated Sandgrouse
Strangely heard in Athi Basin but not seen.

NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 29th July 2018

I spent 7.45am until 1.00pm with Julian Branscombe a visitor from UK.
In the time available we were only able to visit Nagalomon, Athi and
Karen PS Dams, the plains down to the Vulture Drinking Pools but time
would not allow a visit to Athi Dam, Kingfisher or any forest area.
Although it looked like a bright start it immediately clouded over and
was cool.

More interesting species were;

White-faced Whistling Duck
Just a pair at Karen PS Dam, were the only waterfowl apart from Egyptian Geese.

Little Grebe
A pair on Karen PS Dam.

African Spoonbill
Large young at Nagalomon Dam are ready to leave the colony.

Black-crowned Night Heron
Just a few remaining at Nagalomon Dam.

Squacco Heron
Adult in breeding plumage Nagalomon Dam.

Madagascar Pond Heron
One in usual spot at Karen PS Dam, seems to be the first in NNP this
season, but also none reported on the net this year so far which is a
bit alarming.

Yellow-billed Egret
One Nagalomon Dam.

Great Cormorant
White-breasted adult at Nagalomon Dam.

African Darter
Six birds at Nagalomon Dam.

African Fish Eagle
Just one bird at Nagalomon Dam.

White-backed Vulture
Fifteen at Vulture Drinking Pools.

Ruppell’s Vulture
A single young bird at Vulture Drinking Pools.

Bateleur
An adult near Hyena Dam.

White-bellied Bustard
One near the railway crossing.

Black Crake
With chicks Karen PS Dam.

Grey Crowned Crane
Two pairs with young.

Black-winged Stilt
Seven back at Hyena Dam, could these be palearctics this early?

Little Stint
An adult with no sign of any breeding dress at Vulture Drinking Pools
is probably not a returning bird.

Fischer’s Lovebird
Pair on the Nagalomon Dam causeway.

Zanzibar Sombre Greenbul
Singing just inside from Main Gate, which is a new area, also Ivory
Burning Site.

Cardinal Quelea
Adult male in with other feeding weavers.

Yellow-crowned Bishop
Female feeding young along the Mokoyeti, amongst an assortment of
weavers/estrildids.
