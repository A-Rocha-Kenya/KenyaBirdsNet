  <pre>Greetings from Dakatcha Woodland

Yesterday Dec 6 we visited three different wetlands, each with its own set of interesting birds, such as Allen’s Gallinule, Eurasian Bee-eaters and Red-headed Quelea.

Today Dec 7 was the fitting finale – Clarke’s Weavers, nesting at a new site (still a seasonal wetland) on a new date (December). A Thick-billed Cuckoo was singing there.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
