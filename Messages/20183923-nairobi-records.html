  <pre>Happy holidays!

Nature Kenya’s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk recently recorded some birds that were not seen, or rarely seen, in Nairobi in past years. Hinde’s Babblers are now breeding at the University of Nairobi’s Agricultural Field Station, and a juvenile was photographed by James Kashangaki on December 12.

To the east of the Giraffe Centre on December 19, Pied Crows were mobbing a Verreaux’s Eagle Owl, possibly a first for the Wednesday Birdwalk.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
