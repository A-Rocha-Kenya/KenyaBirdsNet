  <pre>Dear All,
When I announced the number of species recorded in “Finch Pentad” and
drew up the list of species I believed I had recorded, or in just five
cases another had reliably recorded in the confines, I had not gone
into it too deeply.
I have since devoted energy into getting this right. This entailed
going back through every “kenyabirdsnet” posting which I have
religiously (or thought I had) archived since Itai Shanni took on the
mantle of launching it (this might come as a surprise) 8th April 2002.
How we have benefitted from the shared information, and how grateful
we should be. At least from a Kenyan perspective as we were sending in
information we were leaving a heritage for the upcoming generation to
extract reams of meaningful data. Now with the advent of Facebook and
eBird, the data is getting diluted and not every important record is
getting to the net, and the right people are not on the receiving end
of the information. So whilst it is fine to use the other media, the
more important observations should also be sent to the
“kenyabirdsnet.” At present information not sent directly is getting
discovered by various members diligently patrolling entries on
Facebook and eBird.

When I produced the original list for the Pentad, and sent it to
Sidney for the Atlas, he checked them against the postings received to
date and found that 124 of my species had not gone into the system.
This is not too much of a surprise as in the years that the Atlas has
been running, not everything has been found in the Pentad that was
recorded since the end of last century. So this entailed spending
several days going through 2400 separate and often lengthy postings to
locate the original records for each of these “missing species.” It
was a long exercise, but I managed to track down all but ten species
as occurring in the Pentad. I have attached the list I returned to
Sidney with the required dates and site of observation. In the vast
majority of cases there is an existing image recording that
individual, but not all. The ten species whose detail of the
observation I have not found I have asked not to be included in the
total for the Pentad, but I would still try and locate them later and
then they can be replaced in the totals. (These are in red on the
attached Missing Species document). Several of these I can see in my
minds eye, but no date, no entry…. as it should be. Our 5 miles by 5
miles currently has 472 species of birds documented to exact date and
exact location within the Pentad.

As I examined all the records, I was getting an insight to some
horrible statistics relative to how things have changed even in the
current millennium, and it is statistics like these that will be
instantly picked up with the current data going into the Bird Atlas
Project. But the most worrying thing is that it is not so readily
identifiable as to the reason for the declines, and that is why it is
so important to keep records to pin point when a decline commences.

To give some examples of why we should be concerned, let’s take
something like Maccoa Duck. The only regular site for the species in
Kenya now, is Manguo Pond, and now it is irregular there. Just at the
beginning of this century, there was a high count of two hundred
there, and during a waterbird census 70 were found at Manguo and on
the same day there were 40 on Lake Oloidien, Naivasha.

In Nairobi National Park, Fan-tailed Grassbird was recorded on most
visits in 2000, and after rain my notes show I was finding up to five
territories there in a day, but in 2018 are there any records of the
species?

The most alarming of all, at the time of its discovery the Nairobi
Pipit only positively known from the Kisembe Ridge Forest and
Woodlands was a familiar sight along roads between Langata Gate and
Impala Lookout, through Kisembe Forest, Ivory Burning Site along the
back road to the Water Tank. Also in the Elephant Orphanage and
outside of NNP in the IUCN compound. Driving around, these birds would
be encountered on the roads, or giving their loud song from the top of
a bush or under the upper canopy of a tree. Seen singly but more often
in pairs, on some days up to five encountered. The reports show that
no Nairobi Pipit has been seen since 4th April 2016 when two were at
Ivory Burning Site where they often fed on the short grass. This has
come as a bit of a shock, but what has happened to them, like
Fan-tailed Grassbird there has not been any man-made change to the
habitat that would account for their disappearance.

Up to April 2003, Verreaux’s Eagles were to be counted on every visit
to Leopard Cliffs, now we are down to a vagrant every few years.

It’s not all falling numbers though; the first Spur-winged Plovers
arrived at Athi Dam in 1995, bred the following year and proliferated
subsequently. Since then they have spread northwards to Hyena and
Nagalomon Dam and it seems that all through the year there are birds
incubating! When I produced the Nairobi National Park Checklist there
were only two records of vagrant Long-toed Plovers ever. Eight years
ago a few birds visited Hyena Dam and obviously liked it and bred.
They stayed on building up to ten birds, but this year as things dried
out they disappeared somewhere, but six are now back. We can deduce
that it is likely the same individuals, because one bird resembled the
southern race with almost entirely white wings, and he is back as part
of the six that have returned.
We are also seeing more Open-billed Storks and Glossy Ibis than we
used to, and of course birds that never used to breed such as Sacred
Ibis, African Spoonbill, Darter and Black-crowned Night-Herons do so
regularly at Nagalomon Dam.

The story of the decline in migrants is very depressing, Shrikes on
passage at the turn of the century were abundant in late April and
May, some falls were impressive such as 2500 Red-backs and 1000 Lesser
Greys, last seasons maximums were 60 Red-backs and 20 Lesser Greys.
It’s now into December, Red-backs used to appear in October when going
south, yet still not a single Red-backed has be reported in NNP this
season! This passage we have not had a single migrant falcon in the
Park as yet, Northern Hobbys used to be a common sight often in
numbers, and roosts of Lesser Kestrels could be up to 300 at Olmanyi
Dam area. Fifty or so Red-throated Pipits used to winter as a flock on
the north end of Athi Dam, where they fed amongst the annual short
weedy growth where it had been underwater, now there are never any at
Athi Dam, and now even single birds are a scarcity anywhere in NNP. As
recently over a thousand Red-throated Pipits were seized in a single
consignment from Croatia bound for Italian Restaurants, we should not
be surprised at any of this, but it does not explain the loss of the
resident species.

Hildebrandt’s Francolins were a commonly heard species along the
Mbagathi, but now it seems they are only to be seen at Emakoko,
Knob-billed Ducks and Spur-winged Geese used to be a regular finds but
now they are an exciting find. We should be very afraid!

There are so many species that have not turned up that are regular or
even resident in nighbouring Pentads, 500 is only a short distance
away!

Best to all
Brian
