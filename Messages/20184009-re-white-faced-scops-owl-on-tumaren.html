  <pre>Dear James.  A most interesting record indeed, which begs the question as to which White-faced Scops Owl it is at Laikipia: Northern (leucotis) or Southern (granti). The area around the equator is supposed to be the transition zone from one to the other, as some pundits would want us to believe !! 

Best wishes
