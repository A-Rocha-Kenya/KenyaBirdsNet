  <hr/>
  <div dir="auto">Hi birders,<div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">Today in Karura Forest, near the Ranger Village, I recorded a Red-chested Flufftail calling from a patch of flooded grassland. I managed to get a sound recording. The record was also fortunately part of a full protocol card which I will submit to the Kenya Bird Map. Simon Carter and David Guarnieri recorded one at Lily Lake earlier this year. I wonder if it is the same individual that has moved or if it&#39;s a different individual.</div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">Best regards,</div><div dir="auto">Sidney</div></div>
