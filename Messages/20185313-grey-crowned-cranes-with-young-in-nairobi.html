  <pre>Greetings birders

The July waterbird counts in the Nairobi area recorded several pairs of Grey
Crowned Cranes with young:

One pair at Limuru Sewage Treatment Works with 3 downy young on July 4.
Four pairs in Nairobi National Park. Three pairs had two feathered juveniles
each Â­ the fourth was too far to be sure.

Many Whiskered Terns flying through the fog over Manguo Ponds on July 4.

Sacred Ibis, African Spoonbill, Black-crowned Night Heron, Reed Cormorant
and African Darter breeding at Nagolomon Dam in Nairobi National Park.

Thika sewage treatment works scheduled on Sunday!

Fleur
