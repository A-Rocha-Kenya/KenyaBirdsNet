  <pre>Hi all

On a recent trip to Kalama community conservancy (just north of Samburu National Reserve) we had a very vocal white faced scops owl roosting in the tree above camp - photos attached. The bird was roosting in an old nest. I have only ever seen this species once before on the Wamba road. That area is very productive for owl viewing - I have seen pearl spotted, African scops and verreaux eagle owl on all of my recent visits!

Also to note is that the first barn swallows have arrived around Lolomarik, Timau, these past 2 weeks.

Regards

Kieran Avery
