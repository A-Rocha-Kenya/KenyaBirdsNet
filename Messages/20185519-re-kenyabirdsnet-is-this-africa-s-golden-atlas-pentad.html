  <pre>Dear All,
Just a snippet, I was right to suspect somewhere like Fair Isle, 7.68
sq kms and as at July this year 388 species!
Best for now

&gt; Hi David and Paul,
&gt; Thanks so much for the input and all the data you dug up. There are
&gt; some pretty impressive figures in your delving.  It’s a problem
&gt; comparing figures when in different parts we are using different media
&gt; with regards to sample areas. In Kenya we use a Pentad of 9km x 9km
&gt; for our atlas, but in Tanzania they are using ¼ degree squares, which
&gt; amounts to over 3,000 sq kms per unit as opposed to our one of 81sq km
&gt; only, so it makes it very difficult to come up with comparative
&gt; figures. What we do know is that we have a Pentad of 9km sides that
&gt; has so far received 480 species. So if we look at the EBird Hotspots
&gt; we are in many cases comparing areas of many many thousands of sq kms.
&gt; In the South American Forests the speciation is undeniably vast, but
&gt; mainly resident species of varying abundance. There are trails cut
&gt; into the forest, and also boat trips often to other trails cut into
&gt; the forest where the species can be remarkably different as a result
&gt; of vegetation change. Again we are trying to compare apples and
&gt; oranges, as we do not know what the area size is that is being
&gt; reported on. However from live postings made on site from EBird
&gt; records, whilst it is probably not possible to do so on line, Cornell
&gt; must have the capabilities of setting parameters such as co-ordinates
&gt; for pentads and extrapolating a list of all species recorded within
&gt; it.  When we have looked at unusual locations for some species here in
&gt; East Africa, that have been posted on EBird we have often found that
&gt; they have occurred on days marked Travelling. So we cannot really
&gt; accept anything until we see the identical standards being used. I do
&gt; feel that there will be pentads that have topped 600 species however,
&gt; but possibly nowhere else apart from South America and Nairobi!, but
&gt; then again remote islands on migration paths such as Fair Isle off
&gt; Scotland might come up with surprises, I will have to see if such a
&gt; list exists. There are still so many possibilities for Finch Pentad
&gt; though. In the rainforests once they have recorded all the residents,
&gt; there are not that many migratory species and hardly anything
&gt; resembling vagrancy… but in Kenya we will continue marching on like an
&gt; Eveready Bunny because so many of our birds are migrants and
&gt; inveterate wanderers, but as with South American lowlands apart from
&gt; an itinerant local wandering such as mixed feeding assemblages, many
&gt; forest birds are not.
&gt;
&gt; Best for now

&gt;&gt; Well David, quite interesting though this is, that list of 702 species
&gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt; the two lodges along the Manu Road in Peru (Cock-of-the-Rock Lodge and
&gt;&gt; Manu
&gt;&gt; Paradise Lodge) is certainly a fallacy. Both lodges are well in the
&gt;&gt; subtropics, with no real lowland around it and, as you must know, the
&gt;&gt; higher
&gt;&gt; you go the fewer species you will encounter. I have had a closer look at
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; listed species, and quite a few of them were recorded from that site and
&gt;&gt; from the tropical Manu lowlands, and from nowhere in between, though
&gt;&gt; there
&gt;&gt; are many places there that are very well covered (including Amazonia and
&gt;&gt; Pantiacolla lodges).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; As these lodges are mostly visited in combination with a trip to the Manu
&gt;&gt; lowlands, following the Manu road and the Rio Madre de Dios, it is
&gt;&gt; obvious
&gt;&gt; that quite a few irresponsible people have listed species seen lower down
&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt; the lowlands, en route to the Manu lodges, under the name of the said
&gt;&gt; lodges. When you go to the websites of the lodges, the Cock-of-the-Rock
&gt;&gt; lodge gives a bird list of 222 species which, though perhaps a little
&gt;&gt; low,
&gt;&gt; will no doubt be more closely to the real figure.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The Peruvian Amazonian lowlands have, of course, many places with a huge
&gt;&gt; bird list of up to 600 species. The highest more or less credible figure
&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt; have seen is that of Amazonia Lodge (the former Hacienda Amazonia) on the
&gt;&gt; upper Rio Madre de Dios, which combines lowland forest and aquatic
&gt;&gt; habitats
&gt;&gt; with foothill forest. On eBird 662 species are listed for this lodge,
&gt;&gt; though
&gt;&gt; here too some species from lower down may have been included. The lodge’s
&gt;&gt; website itself gives a rather credible list of 630 species within an
&gt;&gt; altitudinal range of 500 to 1050m.
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Dear All,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Well I can tell you the &#34;Guarnieri Pentad&#34; in Rome, Italy cannot compete
&gt;&gt; with the Finch Pentad!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Fantastic idea Brian. I agree that this exercise can highlight the
&gt;&gt; incredible diversity of species in and around NNP and go along way to
&gt;&gt; alert
&gt;&gt; the birding community of the incredible richness of avifauna in Kenya.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I did a quick survey on eBird, looking at birding
&gt;&gt; &lt;https://ebird.org/region/world/regions?yr=all&amp;m=&gt;  hotspots  to get a
&gt;&gt; general idea of the amount of species in the top 67 countries with more
&gt;&gt; than
&gt;&gt; 480 species. An eBird hotspot is defined as:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &#34;Hotspots are public birding locations created by eBird users. Using
&gt;&gt; Hotspots, multiple birders can enter data into the same shared location,
&gt;&gt; creating aggregated results available through &#34;View and Explore Data”.&#34;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Hotspots are not defined by measurement. A hotspot can be in an around a
&gt;&gt; lodge, a small park or a national park.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It was interesting to see that there are quiet a few hotspots (50) with
&gt;&gt; more
&gt;&gt; than 480 species. Peru has the most high species hotspots with 18. The
&gt;&gt; hotspot with the most species contains two lodges in Peru with 702
&gt;&gt; recorded
&gt;&gt; species. It would be interesting for birders in these high species areas
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; define a pentad and try to compete against the Finch Pentad.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Please see the attached list of the 9 countries (Kenya has three and NNP
&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt; on the list!) with hotspots with more than 480 species.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Cheers,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
