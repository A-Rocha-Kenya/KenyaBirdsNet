  <pre>Hi James,What an incredible image of the threat display. I think that
this is highly suggestive of the birds breeding at Athi Dam, we will
have to look out for the young. Of course this will be a new breeding
record for NNP and Nairobi County,
Very best
Brian

&gt; All,

&gt; Sunday morning I noticed a pair of Water Thick-knees at Athi Dam
&gt; demonstrating aggressive behavior toward a monitor lizard.  Not sure if
&gt; this is indicative of a nest in the area.  Thought it was interesting since
&gt; these are rarely seen in NNP.
&gt;
&gt; Good birding
