  <div dir="auto">Hey everyone!<div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">I visited Lunga lunga 2 times this week, on Tuesday 20th and Friday 23rd August, there were quite a few surprises I would like to share!</div><div dir="auto">I started off a Lily pond which was now full with water, after some good rains. There were about 50 openbill storks, a purple heron, black crakes, African jacana, a large flock of village, eastern golden and grosbeak weavers, lots of red-billed queleas and zanzibar bishops, and a good surprise was seeing about 40 black-crowned Night herons roosting on large broad-leaved trees along the edges of the pond(they aren&#39;t usual <span style="font-family:sans-serif">in such big numbers</span> for this area, maybe migrants?).</div><div dir="auto">Next I proceeded to my farm, where we get many of the tsavo biome species like: Von der Decken&#39;s hornbill, white-crowned shrike, white-browed sparrow weaver, Superb starlings. <span style="font-family:sans-serif">And as i was leaving i got to see blue-naped mousebirds and a Bateleur in flight. </span>Other coastal residents like the brown-headed parrots and east coast boubou were calling widely. Having got around 50 species, i made my way to the Umba river which is the highlight of Lunga Lunga. </div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">Going down the steep hill towards the river valley, I noticed the river was almost dry and the birds had gathered in good numbers to feast on the fruits and get a cool drink. I first saw the noisy trumpeter hornbills noisily feeding on figs and on closer inspection a Southern-banded snake-eagle(pic attached) that was ready to chase them off it&#39;s favourite tree. I carried along the almost dry river and saw a feeding party of a variety of different species like Chestnut-fronted and Retz&#39;s Helmetshrike, Green woodhoopes, Dark-backed weavers, Brown-breasted barbets, African golden Orioles, and a handful of Black bellied starlings. After enjoying all these birds i moved on to the usual spot to find G<span style="font-family:sans-serif">rey-o</span>live greenbuls(pic attached), they were accompanied by a beautiful Narina Trogon(pic attached) and a pair of African Paradise flycatchers. Going further upstream I saw the resident B<span style="font-family:sans-serif">rown-hooded, Striped, pied, malachite and </span>Giant Kingfishers. Gr<span style="font-family:sans-serif">ey-headed kinfisher was seen on my way home. As I crawled over the rivers rocky boulders, there was a large &quot;pool&quot; that had remained and was full of fish. Here I saw Wooly-necked storks, purple and grey heron, reed cormorant and a pair of African Finfoots! I saw them briefly before they scurried away into a crocodile burrow. As I went on, I saw the resident White-backed and Black-crowned Night-herons in their usual place. After this area the river is quite heavily deforested and there isn&#39;t much to see accept for shambas and livestock on both sides. While going back, I saw the Finfoot pair again but I didn&#39;t manage to get a picture yet the second time (they were extremely shy and fled into the forest running into a cave). Happy enough to have seen them properly I made my way back to Diani.</span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-family:sans-serif"><br></span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-family:sans-serif">Today I went back </span><span style="font-family:sans-serif">briefly</span><span style="font-family:sans-serif"> to lunga lunga  and decided to seek out the Finfoot. Luckily i did manage a picture today(not the clearest of pictures, but anyway attached below), other species I added to my list was an African wood owl, white-crested helmet-shrike</span><span style="font-family:sans-serif">(pic attached)</span><span style="font-family:sans-serif">, Wahlberg&#39;s eagle and a Pallid honeyguide. This year&#39;s list of Lunga Lunga is at 160 species. I know there are many many more.....so hoping to add them pole pole!</span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-family:sans-serif"><br></span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-family:sans-serif">Cheers and have a great night!</span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-family:sans-serif"><br></span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-family:sans-serif">Mustafa Adamjee</span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-family:sans-serif"><br></span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-family:sans-serif"><br></span></div><div dir="auto"><br></div></div>
