  <pre>Thanks for sharing this James and Happy New Year in Kakamega? I had no
idea of this change, but at least it is not as stupid a name as the
Brown-and-White Barbet they threw at us when our beautiful Snowy
Barbet, Lybius senex was at last separated. As it is a Kenyan endemic
you would think BirdLife would have the courtesy of contacting the
ornithological body in that country before choosing an abhorrent name
like they did for a really stunning Kenyan endemic of back-garden
Nairobi where for so many it is a daily encounter, and is anyone
really going to call it a Brown-and-White Barbet, talk about
railroading and this time it&#39;s not SGR!
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Received earlier today a note from www.hbw.com

&gt; *Iâ€™m Arnau Bonan from Lynx Edicions*
&gt;
&gt; *There is one picture*

&gt; *That you identified it as Grey-throated Barbet, but in HBW-Birdlife
&gt; Checklist 2 this species was split and in Kenya there is Grey-headed Barbet
&gt; (Gymnobucco cinereiceps)*
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; *We have changed it.*
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I am not sure the Kenya Birds Checklist subscribes to this split.  Anyway
&gt; here is the picture for the record
