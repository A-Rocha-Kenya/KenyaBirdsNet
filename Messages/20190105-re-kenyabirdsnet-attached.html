&gt; Hi Mark,
&gt; I think it is a young Northern Puffback, and looks very washed out,
&gt; but you needn&#39;t have sent the whole tree, the bird alone would have

&gt; Best for now

&gt;&gt; I , and all local fundis,  struggled with it.
&gt;&gt; With little confidence I am thinking immature/transitioning Northern
&gt;&gt; Puffbackâ€¦ eye colour concerning?
