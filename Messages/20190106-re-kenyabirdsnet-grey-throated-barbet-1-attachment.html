As mentioned by Brain:</div><div class="">&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" class="">"No new species should ever be admitted without peer reviewage prior to&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" class=""><font face="Georgia" size="2" class="">formal publication”. &nbsp; I hope we can all agree on that.</font></span></div><div class=""><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" class=""><font face="Georgia" size="2" class=""><br class=""></font></span></div><div class="">ii). HBW / Birdlife have made a most valuable contribution in highlighting those forms that are clearly in the process of reaching “species status”.</div><div class="">&nbsp; &nbsp; However the Tobias criteria that they use is highly controversial, and they knew it would be right from the onset. It was welcomed by many, but at the&nbsp;</div><div class="">&nbsp; &nbsp; same time it was also ridiculed by many, and largely slammed by reviewers in North America and Europe.&nbsp;</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">To all those involved with the new Kenya Checklist this is one aspect that needs to be discussed and whether the BC takes on board this rather novel approach of a "mathematical point-scoring system” or a more conservative approach when deciding on what constitutes a species.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">iii). With regard to the barbet issue, the form cinereiceps (Grey-headed Barbet) has been treated as a race of Grey-throated Barbet for close on a century, and the first to formally split it were del Hoyo &amp; Collar (2014) on page 636 of their HBW/ BirdLife Illustrated Checklist of Birds of the World.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">The subsequent revision in the on-line forum HBW Alive by del Hoyo, Collar &amp; Kirwan (2019) merely repeats “word for word” what was contained in del Hoyo &amp; Collar (2014) and which Brian attached with his comments the other day.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">So going back to Brian’s comment that no new species should be admitted without a peer-reviewed publication, there is no documentation other than the mathematical score of 9 points accrued by application of the Tobias criteria to this form.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">iv). Meanwhile Nate hits the nail on the head in his e-mail, and I’m sure he speaks for a multitude of Kenya birders out there anxiously awaiting some clarification from the BC on such matters, and so It is essential that any 5th Edition checklist is well researched and meets with the approval of everyone.&nbsp;</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">With best wishes</div><div class="">Don Turner</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div class=""><br class=""></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
