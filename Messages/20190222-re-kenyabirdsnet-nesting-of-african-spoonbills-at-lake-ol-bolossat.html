  <pre>Dear Wamiti,
Pay special respect to the Ol&#39; Bolossat hippos,I had a friends son
killed there by one some years back, don&#39;t take any chances!
Spoonbills should soon be nesting at Nagalomon Dam in NNP.
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Dear Birders,
&gt;
&gt; I have to have observed 3 African Spoonbills on nests yesterday,
&gt; 20-Feb-2019 at Lake Ol&#39; Bolossat. The nest is a heap of reeds (*Phragmites
&gt; sp.*) raised for nearly 12 inches or thereabout above water. They were
&gt; about 10-20 meters apart. There was a flock of about 50 other spoonbills
&gt; around the nesting birds.
&gt;
&gt; I had plans to access the nesting area (wading through) for other research
&gt; interests that would have given me an opportunity to see contents but a
&gt; male Hippopotamus occupying this area showed up feeding as early as 15:00
&gt; hrs. Would you have proceeded?
&gt;
&gt; I hadn&#39;t seen these birds nest before - nature of habitat, nesting
&gt; material, associates etc. I guess there is one more nesting site within the
&gt; Lake.
&gt;
&gt; I though it might be of some interest for some of you too.
&gt;
&gt; Wamiti.
