  <pre>Dear All,
In the recent posting I made for Nairobi National Park, I gave an
incorrect figure. I said that Eurasian Scops Owl was the 472nd species
for “Finch Pentad” and it should have been 482nd. With three species
added to the area already this year we are on a countdown to 500
species.
Best for now
Brian
