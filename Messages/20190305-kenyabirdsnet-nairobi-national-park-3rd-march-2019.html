<div><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt; color: #000000;">Hi Brian,</span></div>
<div><br></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt; color: #000000;">That's a great find for the Finch Pentad and Nairobi National Park.&nbsp; Congratulations!</span></div>
<div><br></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt; color: #000000;">In your letter for your 3 March 2019 visit to NNP, you state, " <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; background: yellow;">The closest<br>northwards, is Samburu District NE of Mt Kenya."</span></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt; color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt; color: #000000;">Recall that I saw <em>Otus scops</em> and recorded its loud call&nbsp;Lolldaiga Hills Ranch (Laikipia County, ca. 20 km off the NW side of Mt. Kenya) at 2130 m asl in cedar-olive-acokcanthera-euclea open woodland on 4 May 2017 (this is at the Main House...where I live).&nbsp; I need to get back to my notes, but, best as I recall, I'd heard this bird calling ('peeeeuu') for a few months before finally seeing and recording it.&nbsp; I heard this owl, and searched for it perhaps 30X before finally seeing it.&nbsp; Call most often heard just after dark...about 19:10 h.&nbsp; It gave the species-typical 'peeeeuu' 2X or 3X, spaced ca. 7 seconds apart...then either flew off immediately (I got glimpses) or (perhaps) remained perched and quiet.&nbsp; As such, very hard to see.&nbsp; 4 May 2017 was the first time I became aware that a pair was present, as they were dueting ca. 5 m apart (1 series of ca. 40X duets);&nbsp; one giving the typical 'loud call'/'territorial call' ('tooo' or 'peeeeuu') followed by the 'fledgling begging call' (a raspy 'kuurp') as often recorded in Europe:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.xeno-cento.org/species/otus-scops)">www.xeno-cento.org/species/otus-scops)</a>.&nbsp; They apparently departed soon after this (perhaps even that night)...as I did not hear any calls after 4 May 2017.<br> </span></div>
<div><br></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt; color: #000000;">I also heard this bird many times at the Main House during ca. April-May 2016...but was never able to see it.&nbsp; It was my 'Mystery Bird' for 2 years.&nbsp; I did not hear this species during 2018, and have not heard it this year.</span></div>
<div><br></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt; color: #000000;">Looking at what notes that I do have at hand, I see that Darcy Ogada said that she saw an Otus scops at Thika on 9 November 2018...also north of NNP. This bird dragged into a house by a cat....where it died.&nbsp;<br></span></div>
<div><br></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt; color: #000000;">Cheers,&nbsp; Tom<br></span></div>

<p>NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 3rd MARCH 2019<br clear="none"><br clear="none">4 EURASIAN SCOPS OWL<br clear="none">This is the first ever record of a Scops Owl in the Park. It is also<br clear="none">the 474th species for &ldquo;Finch Pentad.&rdquo; There is only one feature in the<br clear="none">field that separates Eurasian from African Scops Owl, and that is<br clear="none">whether the 10th Primary is longer than the 5th (Eurasian) or shorter<br clear="none">than 5th (African). The wing-shape is very important if you are a<br clear="none">long-distance migrant, or a stay at home! So we paid special attention<br clear="none">to this feature, and the 10th is longer than 5th, even reaching the<br clear="none">tip of the tail. Nairobi is in a very large hole in the distribution<br clear="none">of African Scops Owl, and there are no records near here. <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">The closest</span><br clear="none"><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">northwards, is Samburu District NE of Mt Kenya,</span> westwards it&rsquo;s common<br clear="none">in the eastern Maasai Mara, eastwards not until reaching the<br clear="none">Tsavo-like habitat, and I have no idea where the closest birds are but<br clear="none">certainly well off the plateau. Then southwards, maps show it as<br clear="none">occurring along the extreme southern border with Tanzania. I have<br clear="none">never seen or heard it anywhere along the road to and including Magadi<br clear="none">or Natron, Southern White-faced is the only Scops representative.<br clear="none">Conversely Eurasian Scops have been examined in the hand from Mt Kenya<br clear="none">south to Nairobi (but not the Park), Limuru, Machakos and Kajiado. I<br clear="none">have no doubts that this is a Eurasian and not African Scops Owl. We<br clear="none">were in the car park at Ololo Lodge. It was the birds that found it<br clear="none">for us, and it was being mobbed by a variety of bush birds, whilst<br clear="none">looking for the instigator of the commotion we flushed the bird twice<br clear="none">and then it posed openly but in vine tangles and we got some nice<br clear="none">images.</p>
