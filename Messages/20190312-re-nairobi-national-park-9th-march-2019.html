  <pre>Dear All,
The karelini Turkestan Shrike in the 9th March montage which I said
was very strange as it had a blackish line down the back, I think this
is an artefact, and is the shadow from the twig to the left of the
bird,
Best for now

&gt; NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 9th MARCH 2019
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Despite being a Saturday, there was no traffic on Magadi Road or
&gt; Langata Road and we arrived at the Main Gate a little after 6.30am.
&gt; The car-park was fairly full, but the queue for the Entry office came
&gt; out the door right across the car-park and formed a second tail.
&gt; Nevertheless with the two Customer Service Clerks working at the
&gt; counters we were out of there in twenty minutes.
&gt;
&gt; There had been no recent rain, temperatures above average with a
&gt; strong wind causing some damage to trees locally. Today the weather
&gt; was exactly the same. A walk around the Main Car Park gave us a few
&gt; birds not encountered later such as Bronze and Northern
&gt; Double-collared Sunbird, but whilst a good variety it didn’t
&gt; contribute very much. There were over a dozen Willow Warblers with
&gt; only three seen inside the Park.
&gt;
&gt; At 6.50am it was still quite dark and not much wanted to say anything,
&gt; but a few Nightingales broke the silence as did a Eurasian Reed
&gt; Warbler, and a few more Nightingales were at Ivory Burning Site but
&gt; little else. There was another on the Nagalomon Dam Causeway, but so
&gt; little of note on the dam. No Palearctic Waders, but brightened up
&gt; with a male Palearctic Little Bittern (see image). There was also a
&gt; Squacco Heron which is likely the bird that has been here for a few
&gt; months now. Four African Spoonbills were not showing any signs of
&gt; nesting activity, but one of the six Darters came back with a beakfull
&gt; jam-packed with leafy twigs. Just one Fish Eagle was perched near the
&gt; Mokoyeti Bridge and was the only one of its kind seen today. Also here
&gt; were the days only Spotted Flycatcher and a singing Zanzibar Greenbul.
&gt; Taking the back road to Hyena Dam the quiet continued but at the units
&gt; there was a surprise in finding a pair of Parrot-billed Sparrows,
&gt; seemingly the first for the north of the Park, (see Images and
&gt; discussion). A Grey-headed Kingfisher was perched on a rock in the
&gt; grassland, not what you would consider typical habits or habitat (see
&gt; Image). As usual we had the first of four Augur Buzzards along here.
&gt;
&gt; At Hyena Dam it was nice to see the young Goliath Heron is still happy
&gt; where it is (see Images), there were single Great, Yellow-billed (see
&gt; Image and discussion) and Little Egrets as well as many Black-headed
&gt; Herons. It had been a good day for herons already! Also present were
&gt; single Yellow-billed and Marabou Storks and two African Spoonbills.
&gt; The waders included five Long-toed Plovers inclusive of the
&gt; white-winged bird, over a dozen Black-winged Stilts, a Common Snipe
&gt; (see Image and discussion), one Green, twenty Wood and three Common
&gt; Sandpipers, a Little Stint, and the days only Ruff.  The only
&gt; passerine of any interest was a female flava Yellow Wagtail. We drove
&gt; between the Mokoyeti and Hyena Dam run-off, but it looks like after
&gt; its fine farewell last week the Greater Spotted Eagle might have
&gt; headed back to his northern nesting area. We have long suspected he
&gt; was a he, but the display last week proved it. As a consequence not
&gt; one Aquila Eagle came our way today. At the Oxbow a couple of Sedge
&gt; Warblers were churring, and the first of just three Black-winged Kites
&gt; seen today appeared. Very considerable drop from over a dozen last
&gt; week.
&gt;
&gt; Before arriving at the Kingfisher Swamp which was without water, we
&gt; had a flock of over twenty Parasitic Weavers which contained many
&gt; adult males in breeding plumage (see Image), later we found the first
&gt; two of a meagre three Whinchats seen today (thirteen last week), and
&gt; the first of seven Northern Wheatears, the only widowbird of the day
&gt; was a male White-winged in full breeding dress. Kingfisher Picnic Site
&gt; had a few people but no desired birds. On to Ololo along the Mbagathi
&gt; River gave us a few species, it still had its Nightingale, the
&gt; Secretarybird was tight on its nest, and there were incredible views
&gt; of a Brown Parisoma at eye-level and a couple of Speckle-fronted
&gt; Weavers in the acacias. At the quarry was out first of just two
&gt; Isabelline Wheatears today, and a very strange Turkestan Shrike, the
&gt; only migrant shrike of the day, (see Image and discussion).
&gt;
&gt; Nothing was there to entertain us at the Pallid Honeyguide spot, who
&gt; still appears to be on holiday, but further along the Mbagathi was a
&gt; very large adult Martial Eagle. At Rhino Circuit we found Red-throated
&gt; Tit and the first of two Olivaceous Warblers today, and a solitary
&gt; Lesser Masked Weaver, then our only Pied Wheatear was along the
&gt; Pipeline.
&gt;
&gt; Athi Dam was a bit more interesting with six Yellow-billed, a tumble
&gt; to just thirteen Whites and two-hundred Marabou Storks, but there was
&gt; a remarkable concentration of 28 adult African Spoonbills, (see
&gt; Image). Six Black-crowned Night-Herons roosted on the Causeway, and
&gt; were our tenth heron species for the day, there were also single Great
&gt; and Yellow-billed Egrets, a young Pink-backed Pelican dropped in, a
&gt; Ruppell’s Vulture came in to drink, the first two Grey Crowned Cranes
&gt; were present, a Spotted Thick-knee, and the Palearctic waders
&gt; consisted of six Black-winged Stilts, four Common Ringed Plover, a
&gt; Common Snipe, eight Greenshank, ten Wood, one Green and four Common
&gt; Sandpipers and eight Little Stints, there was  also  a dozen
&gt; Kittlitz’s Plovers. The best bird was a breeding plumaged Whiskered
&gt; Tern, just the fourth documented record for NNP (see Image).  Banded
&gt; Parisoma were in the Acacia mellifera but no migrant warblers.
&gt;
&gt; Now heading homewards, there was a pair of White-bellied Bustards as
&gt; we were climbing out of Athi Basin, and a Kori Bustard trying to shade
&gt; itself on the plains (see Image), at Karen Primary School Dam a pair
&gt; of Little Grebes and another Common  Snipe, at Eland Hollow Dam was a
&gt; Secretarybird, a female type Western Marsh Harrier searching for frogs
&gt; (see images), a couple of Banded Martins and a few Quailfinch. There
&gt; was a male Yellow Wagtail that was pale grey headed but no
&gt; supercilium, slightly darker ear-coverts, (see Image), probably
&gt; Ashy-headed Wagtail cinereicapilla. Stopping off at Hyena Dam we found
&gt; our second pair of Crowned Cranes for the day, there was a Common
&gt; Buzzard on the edge of the forest, and finally tiny Langata Dam was
&gt; successfully attracting birds and held the male Saddle-billed Stork
&gt; (see Image), single Great and Yellow-billed Egrets, the family of five
&gt; Crowned Cranes that live in this area, single Common Snipe feeding
&gt; with a Common Bulbul drinking right next to it created a sight not
&gt; seen before, two Wood Sandpipers, several Eurasian Bee-eaters at last
&gt; and a female flava Yellow Wagtail.
&gt;
&gt; We were out of Langata Gate at 5.15pm having had a very pleasant day,
&gt; though appalling for migrants with so many expected species just not
&gt; showing up thanks to Arabs eating them by the millions, now we are
&gt; really seeing the effect this bird slaughter is taking on our
&gt; migrants. Still not one migrant Falcon recorded in NNP since last
&gt; May!!!  In spite of this we recorded 181 species. Barn Swallows were
&gt; in very low numbers today. Mammals were widespread, seemingly unusual
&gt; numbers of Giraffe all over the Park, the major concentrations of
&gt; plains game was in the Athi Basin.
&gt;
&gt; Best for now
&gt; Brian
&gt;
&gt; KEY TO THE MONTAGE FOR TODAY
&gt;
&gt; 1	LITTLE BITTERN
&gt; This Adult Male on Nagalomon Dam was of the migrant nominate race.
&gt;
&gt; 2	PARROT-BILLED SPARROW
&gt; There was a pair at the units back of Hyena Dam. Last March I
&gt; photographed a bird I assumed Parrot-billed at the same place,
&gt; thinking this the first ever record for the north of the Park. When I
&gt; downloaded and looked at the image, I was amazed to find that it
&gt; wasn’t one but the Parks first ever Northern Grey-headed Sparrow the
&gt; image of which is no.3. Today’s birds were clearly Parrot-billed
&gt; Sparrows and are the first record for the north of the Park. At home
&gt; adjacent to the Park, in single pairs they are a common garden
&gt; resident, but they really avoid coming into NNP.
&gt;
&gt; 3	NORTHERN GREY-HEADED SPARROW
&gt; Not seen today, see no.2.
&gt;
&gt; 4	GREY-HEADED KINGFISHER
&gt; This was at the back of Hyena Dam, and not a species usually
&gt; associated with sitting in the open on a rock in grassland!
&gt;
&gt; 5	GOLIATH HERON
&gt; The immature is still at Hyena Dam, now starting the fourth week. It
&gt; is absurdly tame, not even blinking as you pass within three metres.
&gt; In fact as the right image shows, it is quite bored of us, and falls
&gt; asleep standing in the water!
&gt;
&gt; 6	PARASITIC WEAVER
&gt; I thought our wintering birds had gone a while ago, but this flock of
&gt; over twenty containing many adult males in breeding dress, was at the
&gt; junction of the north road and road to Kingfisher.
&gt;
&gt; 7	TURKESTAN SHRIKE
&gt; Alarmingly this was the only migrant shrike encountered today. It’s
&gt; unusual in that unlike most Turkestan it is showing an all grey crown
&gt; with no rufous. It’s an adult male with clear white speculum on the
&gt; primaries, the black mask including the lores, but the silvery-grey
&gt; shoulder area is unusual, as is the dark line down the back and the
&gt; insipid rufous tail. Whilst it shows other strange features,
&gt; grey-crowned birds are usually called type “karelini” of Turkestan.
&gt;
&gt; 8	WHISKERED TERN
&gt; This bird in full breeding dress at Athi Dam was only the fourth
&gt; documented record for NNP.
&gt;
&gt; 9	GREY CROWNED CRANE
&gt; As a contribution to the National Grey Crowned Crane survey currently
&gt; taking place, we did not have our first birds until reaching Athi Dam
&gt; where there was a pair. The second pair were at Hyena Dam in the late
&gt; afternoon, and the last were a family of five at Langata Dam, which
&gt; have been usually on the now bone dry vlei on the Kisembe River road,
&gt; and have now relocated.
&gt;
&gt; 10	COMMON SNIPE
&gt; This bird gave a “penny-dropped” moment as it glanced up whilst
&gt; feeding when a Yellow-billed Kite was circling overhead. Snipe feed
&gt; using a long straight bill with sensitive tip and plunging it into
&gt; soft mud repeatedly like a sewing machine. As they ram the bill into
&gt; the mud as deep as they can get, so that the base of the bill and
&gt; sometimes part of the forehead enters the mud or at least surface
&gt; water, they do not want to be continually blinded by mud getting in
&gt; the eyes. So as they have evolved with this specialist feeding, the
&gt; eyes have migrated to the back of the head. When I looked at this
&gt; photograph I could see that not only are the eyes so far back but
&gt; their direct frontal vision must be non-existent as the eyes are
&gt; behind the cheeks. Apart from related Woodcock I cannot think of any
&gt; other birds that have rear vision to this extent. But then as vision
&gt; is not required for food finding and is substituted by the sensitive
&gt; bill tip, the bird must still have to see predators, and it can
&gt; clearly see anything sneaking up from overhead with the rear-vision
&gt; mirrors it has been given. I have never thought of this before, but
&gt; what imagery is it seeing when flying it must be like running a film
&gt; backwards!
&gt;
&gt; 11	KORI BUSTARD
&gt; It was a horribly hot day, with a very strong but still warm wind.
&gt; This bird was trying to find maximum shade under an Acacia. The birds
&gt; have such low crowns, it makes you wonder how much room there is for a
&gt; deductive brain!
&gt;
&gt; 12	IMPALA WAITING FOR TRAIN
&gt; You can see what the attraction for them is here.
&gt;
&gt; 13	WESTERN MARSH HARRIER
&gt; This female-plumaged bird was looking for frogs on foot by searching
&gt; the swampy margins. Then would fly a short distance to another part of
&gt; Eland Hollow Dam.
&gt;
&gt; 14	YELLOW-BILLED EGRET
&gt; Having just had the Snipe revelation as to advantages of eye
&gt; positioning, it was almost immediately followed by this egret, but in
&gt; a totally different way. These birds have to have accuracy when using
&gt; their bill to stab at a prey item, so their eyes must see directly in
&gt; front of the bill but in a three dimensional image to judge distance
&gt; and ensure an accurate strike. So their eyes protrude from the side of
&gt; the head not far behind the base of the bill, but the eyes are not
&gt; flat against the head but facing forward as can be clearly seen in
&gt; this image.
&gt;
&gt; 15	SADDLE-BILLED STORK
&gt; This is the resident male (golden eye) who during the dry period
&gt; wanders all over NNP looking for shallow waters and marshy areas. Here
&gt; it has joined a number of other birds at Langata Dam.
&gt;
&gt; 16	AFRICAN SPOONBILL
&gt; This is a largest gathering I have ever seen in NNP; there are
&gt; twenty-eight adults here at Athi Dam; this surely indicates a marked
&gt; movement.
