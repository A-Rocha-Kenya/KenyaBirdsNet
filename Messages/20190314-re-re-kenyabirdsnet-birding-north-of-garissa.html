  <div dir="ltr"><div>Dear All,<br></div><div><br></div><div>Just to follow up on Brian&#39;s post and thanks for your thoughts Adam, Chege refers to all white underparts with no contrast, and the upperparts look ash-brown to me. In fact I can&#39;t see yellow, green or olive anywhere on this bird, which is most odd for a greenbul. The first image could perhaps pass for Sombre Greenbul in jizz (and the eye does look ok for that sp.) but is anyone really getting a greenbul feel from image 2? The bill is definitely on the heavy side for Sombre Greenbul, and those pale edges to the tertials look funny for a greenbul too. If that is a Sombre Greenbul (which makes some sense as Brian says) it&#39;s the most odd looking individual I&#39;ve ever seen, and perhaps is worthy of a description and name. But Chege&#39;s first point of comparison being a Sparrow-Weaver, and the all white underparts both count against a known greenbul of any sort.<br></div><div><br></div><div>And thanks for sharing the precise location Chege!<br></div><div><br></div><div>Best Wishes,</div><div><br></div><div>James<br></div></div><br><div class="gmail_quote"><div dir="ltr" class="gmail_attr">On Tue, 14 May 2019 at 06:48, Brian Finch <a href="mailto:birdfinch@gmail.com">birdfinch@gmail.com</a> [kenyabirdsnet] &lt;<a href="mailto:kenyabirdsnet-noreply@yahoogroups.com">kenyabirdsnet-noreply@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br></div><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex">

      <p>Hi Adam and all,<br>
This does make a lot of sense, and it does look like Zanzibar, I<br>
suppose the birds in Tsavos are in equally arid habitat, though I<br>
think they like the Commiphora, not too keen on acacia.<br>
They are certainly pretty variable in their given ranges when it comes<br>
to ground colour, but Chege saw them and it will be interesting to<br>
hear what he feels about this suggestion,<br>
Best for now<br>
Brian<br>
