  <pre>Dear All,
As expected the Union for Uniformity in Nomenclature have produced the
awaited new common names list for the Cisticolas, what are peoples
feelings about adopting the recommended these new names?



RECCOMMENDATIONS OF THE UNION FOR UNIFORMITY IN NOMENCLATURE
Occasional Paper from the Committee of the U.U.N. No. 17 Cisticolas

The committee for the UUN has met a number of times and considered the
poor choice of names surrounding the Cisticolas in Africa, and has
voted on the change of the names to those more appropriate.

As there was only one species uniquely found outside the Afrotropical
region, the Golden-headed Cisticola, the vote was unanimous, this is a
perfect name showing its unique golden crown and remained unchallenged
and unchanged.

Now we come to the African Cisticolas, and start with the plain-backed
group and the committee finally agreed on the following;

Singing Cisticola is an appalling name the bird has no musical
qualities and the most fitting name is the Sneezing Cisticola on
account of the many calls that sound like a sneeze, Richard Cisticola
was also tabled as it is another call frequently given, but the
majority ruled in favour of Sneezing.

Red-faced Cisticola is a simple transition to the name of Orange-faced
Cisticola as this is the colour involved, not red.

Whistling Cisticola is a poor name as the bird actually siffles but
wisely this name was not opted for as a species which will no longer
bear that name after this paper is adopted, already exists. The calls
are rising and descending cadences depending on the location and the
name Escalator Cisticola was agreed on unanimously.

Trilling Cisticola is not a trill and the name chosen to replace this
is Vibrato Cisticola.

Rock Cisticola also goes into bushes as well as bounding on boulders
so it might not always be found on rocks so requires a qualifying name
and we chose Rock-preferring Cisticola.

Chubb’s Cisticola  is nearly well named in that it is rather a plump
bird and we chose Chubby Cisticola.

Hunter’s Cisticola is a patronym which does not assist with the
identification, from now on it will be Undulating Cisticola because of
the wavering call.

Now we come to the small short-tailed grassland species.

Desert Cisticola is an atrocious name as it is found in many grassy
habitats up into higher altitudes than the desert is found. It is
probably the most widespread species and we have selected Universal
Cisticola.

Wing-snapping Cisticola is more often heard than seen and because of
the difficulties in observing the bird we have opted for Invisible
Cisticola.

Zitting Cisticola is very widespread outside of the African region and
the name will be Common Cisticola.

Pectoral-patch Cisticola is not changing, the name is perfect as it is
and we only change the name if it is an improvement.

Black-backed Cisticola has a very distinctive chestnut-cap in the
breeding male, and is very attractive. It also has a unique pale
collar in birds in all plumages which is why Crescent-naped Cisticola
was thought a good alternative.

The small Cisticolas with plainer backs have been rearranged as follows;

The word Siffling as in Siffling Cisticola is archaic and refers to
the whistle that an old-fashioned whistling-kettle made when the water
has boiled and the gas turned down. As this word is not used any more
your Committee decided on Kettle Cisticola.

Tiny Cisticola is small but not many cisticolas are Tiny, keeping with
its latin name nana which comes from a French word for Dwarf we
decided that it would be wrong not to maintain the French Connection
and have simply chosen Petite Cisticola.

Foxy Cisticola is a name we do not like as we have never noticed that
they are sly nor steal chickens. But the call is repeated piping thus
the name Picolo Cisticola was the suggestion that garnered the most
votes.

Long-tailed Cisticola is an appropriate name but not as good as the
one you are going to use in future which is Prinia Cisticola.

The streaky sometimes reddish-winged group;

The Winding Cisticola uniquely calls “A,B,C,D” and the name that seems
logical for this species from henceforth is Alphabet Cisticola.

The Stout Cisticola has a unique habit after breeding shared by no
other congeners, they gather in post-breeding groups. We chose
Flocking Cisticola as we have already heard this name being used
commonly by visitors from outside of Africa, “What’s that, oh it’s
just a bunch of Flocking Cisticolas.”

Please make the necessary amendments to your countries Bird Checklists.

The Committee will issue another directive of change which will be
published on 1st April 2020.


Part two is to follow after the Committees rehabilitation……..
