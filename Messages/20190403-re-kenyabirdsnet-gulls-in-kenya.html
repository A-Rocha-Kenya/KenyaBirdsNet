&gt; Hi Adam and Shailesh,
&gt; This is weird, I was comparing your gull from several years back
&gt; today, with the May 2018 and was thinking, this could actually be the
&gt; same bird returning.  Gulls are creatures of habit, look at all the
&gt; Ring-bills in UK. It&#39;s worth following up.
&gt; 
&gt; In answer to Shailesh&#39;s question Caspian, Steppe and Yellow-legged
&gt; would all be new not just for East Africa, but all subsaharan Africa.
&gt; With the new taxonomy we have lost nominate Lesser Black-backed Gull
&gt; for Baltic Gull but until there are new studies, still have Lesser
&gt; Black-backed in the form of Heuglin&#39;s.
&gt; 
&gt; Best for now
&gt; Brian

&gt;&gt; Hi Adam,
&gt;&gt; Large gulls are difficult to id them if they look very similar to other
&gt;&gt; large gull. The photo you took the one in flight looks like a YLG and you
&gt;&gt; need to see how much black it is got from P10-P5.
&gt;&gt; Do you have Klaus Malling Olsen email address? And, if you do please send
&gt;&gt; your images to him. He will tell you what gull it is.
&gt;&gt; If the YLG is confirmed, is it going to be new for Kenya.

&gt;&gt; Hi Brian, Shaliesh et al.,
&gt;&gt; Your &#39;Yellow-legged&#39; Gull appears identical to my Naivasha gull Brian (from
&gt;&gt; 2013 I think?), so I wonder why the &#39;experts&#39; did not suggest that my bird
&gt;&gt; was a YLG?
&gt;&gt; Can you see any visible difference from these images?
&gt;&gt; CheersAdam

&gt;&gt;     Hi Shailesh,
&gt;&gt; Thanks for stressing that we take an interest in the large gulls we
&gt;&gt; see in East Africa. I currently have four nominate Caspian Gull
&gt;&gt; records in with the East African Rarities Committee awaiting
&gt;&gt; consideration, one Kenyan and three Ugandan. But also have another
&gt;&gt; half-dozen records to submit later that may involve Steppe and
&gt;&gt; Yellow-legged Gulls. For the people that went to see the Caspian Tern
&gt;&gt; at Lake Naivasha in May 2018, and saw a larger and paler-backed gull
&gt;&gt; with the Baltic (Lesser Black-backed Gulls) images of this bird have
&gt;&gt; been sent to Klaus Malling Olsen who authored the gull book you are
&gt;&gt; referring to, and his response was that this can only be a
&gt;&gt; Yellow-legged Gull!
&gt;&gt; Best for now
&gt;&gt; Brian

&gt;&gt;&gt; looking
&gt;&gt;&gt; for rare or uncommon gull/swhich can either be with a flock of other gull
