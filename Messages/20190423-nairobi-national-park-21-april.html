  <pre>Nature Kenya’s Sunday Birdwatch on the third Sunday of the month normally goes somewhere where we walk.

Easter Sunday being a special day, we opted for Nairobi National Park. It was the day that the long drought broke, with magnificent clouds in the afternoon.

Highlights included three nests of African Darter on Nagolomon Dam, with the adults feeding the all-white young; some 400 Marabou Storks and three Grey Crowned Cranes at Athi Basin Dam; African Water Rail with a juvenile and Little Bittern at Nagolomon Dam; Verraux’s Eagle Owl seen by one group; both White-backed and Lappet-faced vultures; and lots of beautiful Red-backed, Lesser Grey and Isabelline shrikes (but not as many as Brian mentions for the year 2000!).

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
