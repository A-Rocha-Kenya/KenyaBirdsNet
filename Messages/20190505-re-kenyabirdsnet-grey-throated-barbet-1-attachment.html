    </p><p>Hi Everyone</p>
    <p>I&#39;ve not followed this discussion too closely, but I thought some
      more background information would be helpful (please excuse me if
      you already have this). Some of this is covered by Brian&#39;s email
      below, which I realised after I wrote most of this.<br>
    </p>
    <p>BirdLife recently did an extensive revision of their list, based
      on a published method (see attached). The revision work was lead
      by Nigel Collar, working largely with Lincoln Fishpool (at least
      for most African taxa) and with Peter Boesman doing the vocal
      analyses but taking recommendations from a large number of people
      as to what is worth investigating. My understanding is that large
      numbers of museum specimens were consulted, with actual
      measurements of the features generally made in the case of
      morphology (see below &quot;effect size for wing 3.32&quot;), and
      qualitative assessments made of colour variation in cases of
      plumage. Actual measures made off sonograms are
      used for vocalisation comparisons, although are not relevant here,
      specifically.</p>
    <p>My understanding is that the list revision was done to provide
      consistency to the way species are recognised. Much of the current
      taxonomies is based on early assessments made by people with
      limited experience and small sample sizes, with little rigour or
      consistency. When we first open bird books we assume that the
      &#39;species&#39; delimited therein are correct and we get &#39;comfortable&#39;
      in these ideas. When any change is recommended we automatically
      assume it is wrong and what was before is right. I myself did this
      too. However, I think it was well worth a new perspective, and if
      nothing else it has made me look more closely at a lot of birds,
      for which I&#39;m grateful.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Obviously revising the entire checklist was a monumental task.
      However, this list is not seen as an end point, but rather a work
      in progress, with further investigation/work to follow. Given the
      large number of revision made I think it is understandable that
      each one was not published (it would be impractical and the
      revision would have taken 50 years instead of 5), but the data is
      there available for anyone to access. What I can say, however, is
      that I was initially very sceptical myself, but I have
      checked many of these new proposal myself by looking at skins in
      museums, and the more I look the more impressed I am.</p>
    <p>Coming to this individual case of the barbets, the following
      motivation is given for the split, specifically regarding
      cineraeiceps (available online, this from HBW website (free
      section): <br>
    </p>
    <p><font color="#ff0000">Taxonomy: <br>
        Hitherto considered conspecific with G. bonapartei owing to zone
        of intergradation in C DRCongo (where populations formerly
        separated as race intermedius), but this not an obstacle here to
        its separation, based on larger size (effect size for wing 3.32)
        (2); proportionately rather longer nasal tufts (but these not
        measured; ns[1]); pale iris (3); whiter, narrower streaks on
        forecrown (1); blacker tail (1); broad hybrid zone (1).
        Monotypic.</font></p>
    <p>The number is parentheses is the score given to that criterion,
      from 0 to 4, with 4 being very different and 0 not being different
      at all. Thus it is larger (score = 2; this is an objective measure
      with an effect size of 3.32, see the original paper for further
      details), has longer nasal tufts (score = 1), has a pale versus
      dark eye (score = 3), has narrow streaks on the forecrown (score =
      1), and a blacker tail (score = 1) than the nominate subspecies. I
      don&#39;t remember how the hybrid zone scoring works, but that gets a
      score of 1 in this case; I think the fact that they hybridize but
      still have remained stable, identifiable taxa over much of their
      ranges suggests at least that there is assortative mating and thus
      there is some support that they are &#39;biological&#39; species. Add
      these scores up and you get the total score, which is 9 in this
      case. If I remember correctly, from the early paper it was
      determined that in very well studied groups from Europe, the
      threshold for recognising a split was 7 points, so anything above
      6 is split. Obviously there is some subjectivity to this in terms
      of how different colours are scored (the measurement data are much
      more objective), so one could argue that eye colour should be only
      a 2, but this still leaves us with a score of 8. One could also
      argue that nasal tuft length should be excluded because it was not
      measured. This brings it down to 7. So this is a close one, but
      based on their transparent assessment of a number of characters
      that (in this case) differ subtly, BirdLife has split the barbet.
      Obviously when a bird is split new English names are required. I
      must admit that I&#39;m not particularly fond of many of the English
      names, and I think keeping the names as similar as possible would
      make sense. So I would have gone for Western Grey-throated Barbet
      and Eastern Grey-throated Barbet, but that is another debate.</p>
    <p>Coming back to the method used, there are two major issues I see
      with it, and that is (i) genetic data are not considered and (ii)
      there is a problem with the way they have compared taxa involving
      more than two subspecies, which is mainly a statistical problem. <br>
    </p>
    <p>In the prior case I think this is a shortfall in only a limited
      number of situations. Most taxa that could be split are sister
      taxa; in other words, each other&#39;s closest relatives. I believe
      using percentage genetic difference is fairly meaningless in
      delimiting species, so it then comes down to morphological,
      plumage and vocal differences. In some cases taxa are not each
      other&#39;s closest relatives, in which case I believe they must be
      split. One such case is the Common Fiscal complex, which is
      generally split into Northern Fiscal and Southern Fiscal. Based on
      genetic data they must be split, because Souza&#39;s Shrike sits
      between them. However, for a significant proportion of species
      there is no genetic data and so to keep the system comparable for
      all birds, genetic information has been excluded. <br>
    </p>
    <p>The second problem is perhaps best illustrated with the
      White-headed Barbet group, which consists of five subspecies
      split, now, into three species. The problem I have is that none of
      the three newly recognised species have any unique characters; all
      characters are shared with at least one other taxon, which means,
      really, that they should score 0 on all characters. But the taxa
      were compared in a pair-wise manner, which is scientifically
      incorrect.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Coming back to some points made, in this case I don&#39;t believe
      there are any elements of &#39;self promotion&#39; and having names
      attached to species. I have been involved in several splits and
      the BirdLife team were always very careful not to try to take
      credit for the work. Huambo Cisticola from Angola is a case in
      point, and they offered to withhold the split from the list until
      I had published a paper that I have been working on but is still
      not ready for publication. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Also, I would prefer to call it the BirdLife list (as Brian did),
      as the work was done by BirdLife, essentially. HBW is involved,
      but this is the BirdLife list.<br>
    </p>
    <p>A further point to keep in mind regarding describing new species,
      there is a difference between that and what BirdLife has done.
      BirdLife has not described any new taxa - they all have scientific
      names. All BL has done is to simply raise taxa to species level,
      when they were regarded as subspecies on other world lists. Many
      of the taxa were probably even described as species when they were
      first given names, but later lumped. This is actually the case for
      this barbet, which was described as Gymnobucco cinereiceps Sharpe,
      1891. I can bet you there was no detailed study lumping
      cinereiceps with bonapartei, just an opinion of someone who
      compiled a regional or world list, which others followed without
      question. So cinereiceps was described as a species initially,
      before we came to know it in the field guides as a subspecies of
      bonapartei. Really there is nothing new about it at all, and it
      has already been described as a new species but lumped possibly
      without good justification. BirdLife is perhaps just rectifying
      what was a good species and described as such, which got lumped
      without any proper study.</p>
    <p>That&#39;s my two cents worth.</p>
    <p>Kind regards<br>

                <div>I agree largely with what Brian has said here and I
                  also wonder about the formality of such &#39;studies&#39; (if
                  there were any) and what are the origins of such
                  splits being discussed in the first place; museums,
                  field observations, coffee shop chit-chat? With the
                  studies that Alex Kirschel has done o, the extensive
                  field research is combined with mDNA to produce a

                <div>I am hopeful that the primary motivation is species
                  conservation although I think there are also elements
                  of &#39;self promotion&#39; and getting one&#39;s name attached to
                  a new species, especially given at least one of the

                        <p>Hi Neil and all,<br>
                          As promised I have attached the description
                          (passed to me by Nigel<br>
                          Hunter yesterday), of the Grey-headed Barbet
                          Gymnobucco cinereiceps,<br>
                          presented as a distinct species by BirdLife as
                          opposed to<br>
                          Grey-throated Barbet G. bonapartei.<br>
                          <br>
                          I support the Tobias principal that a bird
                          that is morphologically<br>
                          different should get recognition, and receive
                          appropriate protection<br>
                          for the form. I also think that BirdLife are
                          doing a sterling job at<br>
                          highlighting little recognised forms that
                          deserve our attention.<br>
                          <br>

                          to launch new species<br>
                          onto the planet, and are just printing what
                          they are told to.<br>
                          <br>
                          If we now look at this revolutionary new
                          Barbet, that occurs in East<br>
                          Africa, we must look at the parameters that
                          have been set that lead to<br>
                          the acceptance by both scientific and
                          interested communities of a<br>
                          formally described new species. Is there any
                          scientific-backed<br>
                          evidence, and structural evidence, comparison
                          of bill structure and<br>

                          science, and to all of<br>
                          these the answer is negative, there is no
                          paper, no study, no author,<br>
                          no genetic evidence etc. No-one in the past
                          hundred years has ever had<br>
                          a species accepted as novel merely based on a
                          few feather details, and<br>
                          minor size variation.<br>
                          <br>
                          Looking further into the paragraph, items such
                          as different lengths of<br>
                          nasal tufts, have not even been compared and
                          measured, there is a<br>
                          broad zone over overlap which is brushed
                          aside, all this is a farce<br>
                          and makes mockery of the set of procedures
                          that are in place to<br>
                          prevent cavalier presentation of new species,
                          it could be just as<br>
                          easily you or I or anyone for that matter
                          following this same route.<br>
                          No new species should ever be admitted without
                          peer reviewage prior to<br>
                          formal publication.<br>
                          <br>
                          We are very close to publishing the new Kenya
                          Checklist, is anything<br>
                          going to change for Grey-throated Barbet…. I
                          think not. Are any of the<br>
                          world checklist authorities going to accept
                          this on the evidence<br>
                          provided, I hope not.<br>
                          <br>
                          There are very many other new species that
                          they have also “launched”<br>
                          that are in all likelihood forms deserving
                          specific identity and<br>
                          hopefully all will be followed up with
                          convincing material, but for<br>
                          this Barbet alone it is all too wishy-washy
                          and unconvincing and there<br>
                          lies the problem.<br>
                          <br>
                          All this may seem harsh, and as I say BirdLife
                          have my support, but<br>
                          with this they are transgressing the ethical
                          boundaries of species<br>
                          representation, great for the world listers
                          but is it the road to<br>
                          complete chaos? With all the necessary
                          evidence for this form provided<br>
                          and following the correct guidelines, it may
                          well be that they are<br>
                          right after all, but at present they are not.<br>
