Down the years we have with partners in conservation tried our best to study the patten but we have not yet got to the bottom of the matter.to many bird enthusiast who have made a visit with me at Mackinder's eagle owl sites they might have noted that i have been taking most of the guests to some odd sites far away taking Us a few hours,away from some of the places we call 'usual' and even missing a site of this species in some visited roost sites(tour groups like with Terry stevenson,Sammy mugo,Ben mugambi,Chege Kariuki and many others have once missed out) we have 16 marked roost site and 13 breeding sites(i can tell when each is breeding or roosting) but the most effected sites are next to human populated areas where activities like grazing,irrigation or even homes are built.one site which is easily accessible is 'road site' ,which is by the main Nyeri-Nyahururu road&nbsp; which my records shows Owls last breed in 2011 May.but this year and last week Saturday 4th we had a 1 month and 2Weeks chick fry from the same old nesting site to a near by roost site at a close watch of both parents,but this success has a price,i&nbsp; have been monitoring the nest site with 2 remote sensing cameras which were previously in the field monitoring the Abyssinian long eared owl roost site in Mt Kenya,with a combined efforts between Darcy Ogada who i always reach to for assistance in such situations and&nbsp; Many others.I have noted some farmers or villagers could be behind this poaching.when i was putting up these cameras i called a meeting of some farmers and gave them an insight and the purpose of using the remote cameras. maybe they might have seen the sense and alert others to let owls breed peaceful this time.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We are still to adopt a new mechanism to deal with this problem where all stakeholders will be involved,education,sensitization,counter campaign etc,with this short belief i wanted to reach to guests and tour guides to always assist Me by inquiring when they want to visit earlier in advance to have me have well plans on which site accessible even when am not around, i have 4 trustee farmers who always assist me and they have know much about Owls and guests.meanwhile i would like to send my votes of appreciations to all tour companies,individuals leading the groups and your guests for your kind support to this project both thorough contributions and buying an Owl t shirt. frankly your support has made us been able to study the challenges facing Owls not only in my area.thanks for your support of AM NOT A BAD OMEN campaign.the work on Abyssinian Longeared Owl is still going on. is there anyone who have used&nbsp; any&nbsp; route from the mountain Rock to the summit peak of Mt Kenya or Karatina Town or Embu University sides??(these are the most visible point from my work point (by Bins) and can be accessible easily other than the Narumoro one which i use and takes me 14hrs walk one way with my team.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Happy birding&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></div></body></html>
