We tried to follow but never got a clue where the nest was. Not far later an individual took off about 2mtr from my foot and there was a nest with two eggs. About 3cm deep and 3 wide (internally) attached is the foto of the nest.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;color:#1F497D'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;color:#1F497D'>Then later during the day while photographing Bristle-crowned Starlings feeding together with White-crowned Starling realized one wasn’t super active like the others and never flew away while others did. I checked just to find the immature bird was full of ticks only on the head. I extracted about two dozens of ticks and there were quite a lot of tiny ones that my fat fingers would not remove. Never seen a bird before infested by the large “cow” tick. And the bird looked petty weak.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;color:#1F497D'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;color:#1F497D'>Other nesting records includes last year in Nov an Abbort’s Starling nesting on the same tree with Silvery-cheeked Hornbill in Castle Forest, 3 weeks ago while catching white-eyes for research work was another nest of Silvery-cheeked Hornbill in Castle Lodge and one seen along the road collecting mud and flying a different direction from the current nest meaning there must be another pair breeding.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;color:#1F497D'>Many thanks and best regards<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;color:#1F497D'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;color:#1F497D'>chege<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;color:#1F497D'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;color:#1F497D'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><div><p class=MsoNormal><a href="http://www.birdwatchingeastafrica.com/"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Candara",sans-serif;color:#0563C1'>Birdwatching East Africa</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;color:#0563C1'> – birding, wildlife &amp; photo tours</span></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Candara",sans-serif;color:#0F243E'><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Candara",sans-serif;color:#0F243E'>P.O.

It was also good to show him just<br>how good “Finch Pentad” really is, and how it really is the runawayst wishes<o:p></o:p></p><p>chege<o:p></o:p></p><p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p><br>contender for the richest avian diversity for a 9 km sided square, on<br>the whole African continent. Before Nigel arrived I had recorded<br>Black-headed Oriole and Black-collared Apalis, two species we were<br>otherwise, not encountering today amongst the staggering 170 other<br>species we were to record just in that one Pentad. This morning (5th)<br>by 8.00am, in our paddock as well as the two species yesterday, I had<br>African Goshawk, Gymnogene, Barn Owl, our lost Golden-tailed<br>Woodpecker, the season’s first Blackcap, (which was the only<br>Palearctic apart from Eurasian Bee-eater and Barn Swallow),<br>Yellow-whiskered Greenbul, White-starred Robin and Parrot-billed<br>Sparrow and the most staggering of all the misses yesterday<br>Emerald-spotted Wood-Dove! I will take a few forays out during the<br>course of today to see if there are any more additions, as a few<br>common species are not revealing their presence.<br>Back to NNP, we covered all the accessible squares in the Park,<br>closing the days total for species inside the Park at 206. There were<br>no particularly unusual finds, but it was a very good day.<br><br>We met up with Sidney, at 6.45am and being a Monday there was no<br>queue, and after completing the formalities we had a walk around the<br>car-park before going in. Species in the car-park not recorded later<br>were Cinnamon-chested Bee-eater, Snowy Barbet, Green-backed Honeybird,<br>Brown-backed Woodpecker and Northern Double-collared Sunbird.<br><br>It was quiet driving down to Ivory Burning Site, and rather dull there<br>as well, but the Zanzibar Greenbuls were singing well and the seasons<br>first Black Stork flew by. Nagalomon Dam had a rise in water, and the<br>island appears to be getting smaller, there were only a couple of<br>immature Black-crowned Night-Herons, a black-billed Great Egret was<br>present also, ten African Darters of which a few appeared to be on<br>nests, an adult Fish Eagle was keeping watch and the only migrant<br>waders here were a couple of Black-winged Stilts, Green Sandpiper and<br>a Common Sandpiper. A possible Marsh Warbler crossed from the dense<br>scrub on one side of the road to equally dense cover on the other, but<br>not seen thereafter. White-rumped Swifts were flying around the<br>Mokoyeti bridge at the outlet to the dam, and by now, it was time to<br>take the back road to Hyena Dam.<br><br>We were finding a good number of birds along here, one flying eaglet<br>was at the Fish Eagles nest, one of just two Augur Buzzards, a<br>Red-faced Cisticola at the creek was important as it meant that we<br>finished the day with all ten Cisticola species, and this is the most<br>unreliable. There were male Red-collared Widowbirds in colour but with<br>brownish edgings to the wings, at the units the House Sparrows,<br>Village Indigobirds etc., were waiting for us, but also a Spotted<br>Flycatcher and the first Tree Pipit for the season. Just before<br>arriving at Hyena Dam we broke the news to Sidney that our tradition<br>was that we do not eat breakfast until we can leave Hyena Dam with 100<br>species recorded up to there, we left Hyena Dam with 115. The dam had<br>another Fish Eagle, eight Black-winged Stilts, a pair of Long-toed<br>Plovers, the seasons first Common Snipe, Greenshank, ten Wood, three<br>Green and two Common Sandpipers, a few Barn Swallows and a Sand Martin<br>resting amongst the numerous Plain Martins present, and finally three<br>Greater Blue-eared Starlings.<br><br>Taking the circuit along the Mokoyeti we picked up African Water Rail<br>at the oxbow, another Black Stork, a lone Marabou on the vlei, also<br>still present in the evening and it was the only one seen all day! The<br>first few of over a dozen Black-winged Kites seen today, the days only<br>Wire-tailed Swallow, a Nightingale flew off the side of the road near<br>the Mokoyeti Bridge and sat for a while in a bush, a seasonal first,<br>but no Nightingales were heard anywhere. Back at Nagalomon Dam was the<br>days first African Spoonbill.<br><br>We set off for Kingfisher Picnic Site, but detoured to drive through<br>the forest section just on top of the Kisembe plateau, in the forest<br>we found the first of three Tawny Eagles for the day, as well as<br>Narina Trogon, Yellow-rumped Tinkerbird, Cabanis’ Greenbul, White-eyed<br>Slaty Flycatcher, Willow Warbler and Black-and-White Mannikin, all of<br>which were not encountered again. We also found a party of another<br>four Tree Pipits. As time was running away now we did not take the<br>road alongside the Kingfisher Swamp, added a few at the picnic site<br>but strangely not Red-throated Tit, and Banded but not Brown Parisoma!<br><br>As we passed the old burnt area there were a pair of Shelley’s<br>Francolins, and the season’s first Booted Eagle, a pale bird. Another<br>seasonal first was a young Isabelline Shrike with the only rufous<br>being the tail, and a second similar bird seen later near “The<br>Beacon.” On the road to Ololo we had a pair of Secretarybirds with one<br>on a nest atop a Balanites, a male Bateleur, a pair of White-bellied<br>Bustards, the seasons first Isabelline Wheatear and the only wheatear<br>of the day, a few Speckle-fronted and ten Grey-headed Social-Weavers.<br>Because it was 1 pm now, much later than we usually arrive at Ololo,<br>it was quiet but Brown Parisomas were noisy and so was a Greater<br>Honeyguide. Towards Leopard Cliffs were a few Eurasian Bee-eaters,<br><br>The late hour also meant no singing Pallid Honeyguide below Baboon<br>Cliffs although the Lesser in the same fig, was very vocal, and nearby<br>the young Martial Eagle was on its nest.<br>Climbing the hill away from the Mbagathi we had a lone Grey-headed<br>Silverbill, but more interestingly it was carrying nesting material<br>and although African Silverbill has nested in the Park, Grey-headed<br>has never suggested that it did though I suppose we should not be too<br>surprised. In the woodland above Hippo Pools we had the first Spotted<br>Thick-knee recorded at this site, a Long-billed Pipit and several more<br>Speckle-fronted Weavers, whilst along the river we found the season’s<br>first Steppe Eagle, and likewise first Red-backed Shrikes with two<br>adult males and a female, followed by the first Whinchat and another<br>three different birds seen around the dam near the Empakasi junction.<br>Whilst not following all of the Rhino Circuit because of recent<br>flooding we drove into the woodland as far as enough to find three<br>Red-throated Tits and Lesser Masked Weaver, and also entered Athi Dam<br>from the west side as the Pipeline road access would almost certainly<br>be treacherous. The water level was well up and only fragments of<br>margin, otherwise the water was in the vegetation. Species found<br>included four White-faced Whistling-Ducks, a couple of Yellow-billed<br>Storks were the only Storks present, a couple of African Spoonbills<br>and Black-crowned Night-Herons, a Striated Heron, Great Egret, a<br>drinking Secretarybird, adult Fish Eagle, Lappet-faced Vulture, four<br>Water and one Spotted Thick-knee, only four Black-winged Stilts, a<br>Marsh Sandpiper, three Greenshanks, two Little Stints and three Ruffs,<br>and the best bird being an adult Whiskered Tern. Banded Parisoma and<br>Lesser Masked Weavers were in the mellifera stands.<br><br>On the return which was rather hurried as we were getting late, a<br>Little Grebe on the Vulture Drinking Pools and a couple of Banded<br>Martins over the adjacent grassland, on flooded ground near “The<br>Beacon” were pairs of Yellow-billed Duck and Red-billed Teal, another<br>Shelley’s Francolin, and in another flooded area, an adult Martial<br>Eagle standing in water where the only prey could have been frogs!<br>Also a pair of Pangani Longclaws in the grasslands, at Karen PS Dam<br>another White-faced Whistling Duck, a male Pallid Harrier and<br>Rosy-breasted Longclaw when almost back to the Hyena Dam run-off where<br>there was a superb sight of three adult and one immature Black Storks<br>by the road. The first pair of Grey Crowned Cranes at last made<br>appearance with another pair on the way to Langata Gate, and for the<br>up to now missing Black Crake today we stopped back at the Oxbow along<br>the upper Mokoyeti, and called one out with the App!!!<br>It was fairly uneventful on the way to Langata Gate where we exited at 5.50pm.<br><br>Some muddy sections had not dried out after the rains last week, and<br>could be hazardous.<br><br>Mammals were widespread with no major concentrations, apart from Athi<br>Basin and adjacent river.<br><br>The Gladiolus that used to be ukambensis is having a major flowering<br>whilst altogether the flowers are not very impressive in spite of the<br>heavy rains.<br><br>Best to all<br>Brian<br><br>KEY TO MONTAGE<br><br>1 YELLOW-BILLED DUCK<br>Only one pair seen, but unusual to have them at nearly eye-level.
