  <pre>Dear All,
In the last report for NNP, I mentioned that we had found a pair of
Side-striped Chameleons Trioceros bitaeniatus on the Ololo track, it
was a new reptile in the Park for me, and I had never actually heard
of them being found in NNP before. There were so many birds on the
montage and not enough room for the chameleons! Here are images on
abundantly flowering Asparagus racemosus,
Best to all
Brian
