  <div dir="ltr">Dear birders,<br><br>On Sunday, I was in Nairobi National Park with Jagi Gakunju and a couple of other friends for the bi-monthly game count. As always, we took the opportunity to do some bird atlassing along the way as well. The park was wet and it drizzled intermittently all day but the birding was fantastic! Some highlights included:<div><ul><li>2 Lesser Moorhens. One in the grasslands on your way to No. 8, past the old radio beacon. The other at the small swamp near No. 8. Both dove into cover as soon as we saw them, so we got no photos unfortunately. We did however see them well enough to ID them confidently.</li><li>Breeding Jackson&#39;s, White-winged and Red-collared Widowbirds. Jackson&#39;s were in the area north of the Mokoyeti River towards No. 7. Red-collared were in the south-west from around Ololo to the forest edge. White-winged were widespread.</li><li>Good numbers of Great Spotted and Diederik cuckoos and a few Jacobins and Red-chesteds as well.</li><li>Three Southern Pochards at Athi Dam. One had been caught by a small crocodile and was taking its final breaths! It was still alive when we left but I&#39;m sure it succumbed eventually.</li><li>Black-shouldered Kites were numerous and widespread. There seems to be one after every kilometer. Several were immatures.</li><li>The Martial Eagle pair in the Sosian Valley were mating</li><li>One Lesser Flamingo was roosting at Nagolomon Dam</li></ul>We ended the day with 116 species, having managed Full Protocol cards for 3 pentads and an Ad Hoc card for one pentad. This was without visiting Hyena Dam, the Hippo Pools trail, Kingfisher PS or the Kisembe Forest. Of mammals, plains game were mainly in the southern section of the park. Wildebeest seem to be outside the park right now, with only a handful in the park. We saw several Black-backed Jackal pairs and all were actively hunting rodents, indicating there are many in the grass at the moment (hence the influx of Black-shouldered Kites). Someone else saw a Leopard near the Clubhouse and a Cheetah near Nagolomon.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br clear="all"><div><div dir="ltr" class="gmail_signature" data-smartmail="gmail_signature"><div dir="ltr"><div><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><font color="#444444"><b>Sidney Shema</b></font><div><font color="#444444">Project Manager, <a href="http://kenyabirdmap.adu.org.za/index.php" target="_blank">Kenya Bird Map</a><br></font></div><div><span style="font-size:12.8px"><font color="#444444"><br></font></span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(68,68,68)">Website/Blog: </span><a href="http://www.shotsbyshema.com/" style="font-size:12.8px" target="_blank">www.shotsbyshema.com</a><font color="#444444"><span style="font-size:12.8px"><br></span></font></div><div><font color="#444444"><span style="font-size:12.8px">Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ShotsByShema/" target="_blank">Shots By Shema - Untamed Photography</a> <br></span><span style="font-size:12.8px">Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shotsbyshema/" target="_blank">@ShotsByShema</a></span></font></div><div><font color="#444444">Mobile: +254738290842</font><br><br></div><div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><b style="font-size:12.8px"><span style="font-size:12.8px">Join the </span><a href="http://kenyabirdmap.adu.org.za/" target="_blank">Kenya Bird Map project</a> and contribute directly to bird conservation through citizen science!<br></b></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
