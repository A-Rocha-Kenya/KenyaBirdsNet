When our<br class="">birds go south, so do the KZN birds to breed in the Eastern Cape. It's<br class="">dangerous to suppose anything in birds nowadays, but it would suggest<br class="">that our birds do not go as far south as Natal and are southern<br class="">Tanzanian and Mozambican birds.<br class="">Best for now<br class="">Brian<br class=""><br class=""><br class=""><br class=""><br class=""></div></div></blockquote></div><br class=""></div></body></html>
