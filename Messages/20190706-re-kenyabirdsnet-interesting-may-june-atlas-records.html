  <pre>Thanks Don, Darcy and all,
Interesting that again, the only displays observed were aerial and
from the ground. I am sure that Dr Cecilia would have mentioned any
that called from elevated perches as in the NNP bird, but there just
doesn&#39;t seem to be any documentation covering the subject,
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Dr Cecilia Gichuki chose the African Snipe for her Doctorate degree.  Here
&gt; is a summary of her Thesis:
&gt;
&gt; This thesis gives the results of 34 months (March 1997 to December 1999) of
&gt; field study of the African Snipe at Lake Ol&#39; Bolossat (36° 26&#39;E 00° 09&#39;S)
&gt; and surrounding highlands. The area is characterised by extensive
&gt; destruction of marshes and catchment of the basin. The African Snipe is very
&gt; sensitive to habitat destruction and can be a useful indicator of habitat
&gt; quality. The aims of the study were to determine population characteristics,
&gt; foraging behaviour and factors that influence reproductive success of the
&gt; African Snipe. The focal animal-sampling technique and radio-tracking
&gt; methods were used to study foraging behaviour and movement of marked and
&gt; unmarked birds respectively. The relative age of individuals was determined
&gt; from changes in pulmage and body size. The sex of adults was determined from
&gt; cloacal examination and DNA analysis. The diet was investigated by observing
&gt; foraging birds, analysing faecal material and potential food items collected
&gt; at foraging sites. There was a resident population of African Snipes that
&gt; bred and foraged in the study area throughout the year which numbered 900 to
&gt; 1200 birds. The mean population density was 14.7 + 0.17 birds km-2 and the
&gt; average sex ratio of 1.24:1 was slightly skewed towards males, especially
&gt; early in the breeding season. Whereas most of the snipes (86.7%) occurred in
&gt; Lake Ol&#39;Bolossat Basin, a few (14%) were found in upland marshes. The study
&gt; has shown that African Snipes are monogamous. Males performed distinctive
&gt; aerial and ground displays, defended small breeding territories (&lt;10 ha) and
&gt; guarded the nest. The females selected the nest site, built the nest and
&gt; incubated the eggs. Nests were in more elevated sites (mean 8.49 + 1.60 cm
&gt; above water or ground), which were in shallower water (mean 3.51 + 0.47 cm)
&gt; and in denser clumps of grass (mean 26.02 + 0.8 plants/m2) than random
&gt; locations. Clutch size ranged from two to four with a mode of three eggs.
&gt; The egg-laying dates (Julian Dates) varied significantly among pairs nesting
&gt; in stream-marshes, lake-marshes, tall wet grassland and abandoned
&gt; cultivation with mixed herbs (F 3,141 = 278, P&lt;0.001). The incubation period
&gt; ranged from 19 to 21 days and did not differ between nests built in
&gt; different periods and sites. Hatching success ranged from 54 to 69% and
&gt; varied significantly between pairs nesting in different periods and habitat
&gt; types. The maximum hatching success of 1.98 + 0.14 hatchings per nest
&gt; occurred in 1998 while minimum of 1.63 + 0.39 hatchings per nest occurred in
&gt; 1997. The average fledging success of all pairs during this study was 1.26 +
&gt; 0.47 fledglings per nest. The overall reproductive success of snipes
&gt; breeding in the study area was estimated at 38.2% (146 juveniles/382
&gt; hatchlings), indicating that only one out of three chicks hatched survived
&gt; to adult age. African Snipes foraged in a wipe range of wet habitats within
&gt; a mean home range size of 39.08 + 4.6 ha (n = 7 birds). Its diet mainly
&gt; consisted of large invertebrates, particularly annelids (34.4%), crustaceans
&gt; (20.7%), insect larvae (17.8%), and molluscs (5.8%). While searching for
&gt; food and nest sites, the snipes moved in altitude from the lake basin (2340
&gt; m) to as high as Dundori Hills (2700 m).
&gt;
&gt; Recoveries of ringed birds indicated that most of the snipes made localized
&gt; movements but a few vacated the study area for extended periods. During this
&gt; study, a decline of about 34% of the African Snipe population was estimated
&gt; in Kenya.
