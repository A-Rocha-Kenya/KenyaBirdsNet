      <p>Dear All,<br>
On 14th July two carloads of Nature Kenya bird atlassers set off for a<br>
day on the Magadi Road. The fist driven by Samira Khan also had her<br>
birding friend Farah from India out with her family, Fleur Ng’Weno and<br>
myself, whilst that driven by Ben Allen carried Jennifer Oduori, Peter<br>
Mureithi and Timothy Mwinami.<br>
<br>
It was a cloudy start when we reached Corner Baridi at 8.00am and the<br>
birds were quite inactive, a few were found on a short walk down the<br>
road but nothing surprising and Lyne’s Cisticolas kept to cover,<br>
although there was a showy Klaas’ Cuckoo which was our only cuckoo for<br>
the day. It got brighter and warmer as we descended away from the<br>
Ngongs and our next stop was the steep descent just after Kisamese<br>
(now signposted as Kisamis!). Here there was a good deal of activity<br>
to keep us interested, and birds only recorded here today included<br>
Red-winged Starlings, extravert Red-fronted Tinkerbirds, Southern<br>
Grosbeak Canary (as well as Brimstone, White-bellied, African Citril,<br>
Reichenow’s and Streaky Seedeaters), a rather high male Eastern<br>
Violet-backed Sunbird (as well as Variable, Bronze, Marico,<br>
Scarlet-chested and Beautiful), very surprisingly a pair of Red-headed<br>
Weavers (very rare in this area), very handsome Black-necked Weavers<br>
(and additionally Lesser Masked and Baglafecht), Black-faced and<br>
Crimson-rumped Waxbills, Schalow’s Wheatear, Little Rock Thrush, the<br>
now resident Zanzibar Greenbuls, Black-backed Puffback at its only<br>
location on this road after leaving the Ngongs and a distant<br>
Long-crested Eagle. On leaving here after our picnic breakfast we had<br>
already exceeded fifty species.<br>
<br>
A brief stop at the Water Tower for a pair of extremely extravert<br>
Rosy-patched Bush-shrikes also gave us Nyanza Swift, Ashy Cisticola,<br>
and another Southern Grosbeak Canary as well as some commoner<br>
additions, and sadly a little further down the road was a crushed male<br>
Slender-tailed Nightjar.<br>
Whilst driving past the Icross Road, I thought I might have heard<br>
Pringle’s Puffback, so we backtracked to the junction and called the<br>
front car back. We played the App. But no response at all. So we<br>
looked for a way into a boma that brought us in to a good stand of<br>
acacias and Balanites, in fact it was almost closed canopy but very<br>
open underneath. We were picking off new species regularly, including<br>
Von de Decken’s Hornbill (only two of these and one Red-billed were<br>
recorded today as there are hardly any trees larger enough for them to<br>
nest in nowadays), Taita Fiscal, Hildebrandt’s Starling, Fawn-coloured<br>
Lark, Buff-bellied Warbler, Green-winged Pytilia etc. On deciding to<br>
leave we had started but I thought I had heard the Pringle’s give a<br>
couple of muffled notes, but that is all it did. We continued looking<br>
in the same area still picking up new birds for the day and playing<br>
the App. and not getting any response at all decided to leave again.<br>
The once again I thought I had heard the bird give just one harsh<br>
“chht” but this was certainly not a vocal bird, and we turned back yet<br>
again and played the App. Silently in an acacia a male Pringle’s<br>
Puffback appeared and fed unconcernedly and silently. We called Ben<br>
back again and everyone had very nice views of the bird. The important<br>
thing about Pringle’s Puffback on Magadi Road is that it is rare, an<br>
undescribed race and endangered by all the charcoal harvesting and<br>
having no safe refuge. I first discovered the bird at the end of the<br>
last century!<br>
<br>
The bird slipped off as silently as it had appeared and this time we<br>
were heading off too. On the walk back to the road, a single acacia on<br>
the edge of the scrubby patch, had a pair of African Bare-eyed Thrush<br>
in it, and a pair of Red-throated Tits in it, but as we looked in this<br>
one small tree we started to find other things and for a tree of<br>
uncommon species this was it, with pairs of Mouse-coloured Penduline<br>
Tits (Africa’s smallest bird), Banded Parisomas, Cut-throats,<br>
Blue-capped Cordon-bleus, as well as singles of other species.<br>
<br>
Walking back to the car we met with a couple of Morans who had seen us<br>
birding on the land, but expecting some controversy they were very<br>
friendly and welcoming. In fact everyone we bumped into today was like<br>
this, but then we didn’t get out of the cars at Oltepesi the hotspot<br>
for confrontation! After a few more additions we set off to look for<br>
Spotted Eagle-Owls in a ravine that were seen by Peter the previous<br>
week. More birds along the road gave us White-crowned Shrike and<br>
Vitelline Masked Weavers. We walked (clambered over boulders actually)<br>
up the ravine but the only species of bird were a few Common Bulbuls.<br>
There were a couple of female coloured Ngong Agamas (only ever found<br>
along this road and recently described).<br>
