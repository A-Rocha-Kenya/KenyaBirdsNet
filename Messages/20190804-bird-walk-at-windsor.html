Today 4th August 2019 we had an early bird watching me and guest starting at 6.48 am, the sun raise was so beautiful from our main entrance to the reception on Acacia tree birds active was so live on the branches, We saw a Chin - spot Batis &nbsp;Olive Thrush, Commo Bulbul and 20 lesser striped swallows on the roof at least 13 sitting and 7 other were flying feeding. We proceeded to the Forest on the right side of the Jogging truck another activities of water birds, Sacred Ibis, Great White Egret, Black Egret for my first time at Windsor and the number of Reed cormorants were higher than usual at least 42 on the trees Little grebe Yellow Bill Duck African darta and Grey heron at the lake. As we proceeded to the Forest we had another chance with feeding party after a walk where I was so challenged with a bird till I share to my guest that I see a new bird here. First I thought was White - eyed Slaghty Flycatcher but itâ€™s movement on the tree was strange, I had to check it again and again, the reason we had fog and view was not clear. Finally I tracked it till I identified it to be Grey cuckoo shrike.<div>Birders is the bird on the transit or is at the Migrating feeding zone first time at Windsor it is my second time see it, first I saw it at Arabuko Sokoke Forest mid 2000.</div><div>Keep birding</div><div>Jonathan Mwachongo<br><br><br><a href="https://overview.mail.yahoo.com/?.src=iOS">Sent from Yahoo Mail for iPad</a><br></div>
