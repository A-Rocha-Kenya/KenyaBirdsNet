Dear Brian.  Great photos of your Grey-headed Kingfisher the other morning.
The brown not grey head, also the dark chestnut belly CLEARLY distinguish this individual as a northern migrant. Possibly race semicaerulea which I think has reached the Tana River.  Its home is in the Yemen and Eritrean coast.
