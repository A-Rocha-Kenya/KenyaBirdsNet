  <pre>Hi Fleur,
It really is a very early date for a Common Buzzard, but
Honey-Buzzards do sometimes oversummer, although I haven&#39;t heard of a
bird doing that in Nairobi before but a good forest like Karura would
be ideal as long as there are bees and wasps,
That&#39;s all I can suggest,
Cheers
Brian

&gt; Greetings birders
&gt;
&gt; As Brian noted, I used to think of July and August as quiet birding months,
&gt; but Nature Kenya&#39;s Wednesday Morning Birdwalks have been recording long bird
&gt; lists in July and August this year.
&gt;
&gt; At Karura Forest this week (Aug 28) we had a variety of raptors – Ayres’s
&gt; Hawk Eagle, Long-crested Eagle, Augur Buzzard, Black Kite. Then a buzzard
&gt; flew rapidly across the playing field near the swamp. It seemed the right
&gt; size, shape and coloring for a dark Common (Steppe) Buzzard. But August 28
&gt; seems awfully early. Any advice?
&gt;
&gt; Wishing you good birding, Fleur
