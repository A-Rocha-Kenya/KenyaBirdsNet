  <pre>Hi Hugh,
It&#39;s a pleasure, but I think we also owe you in showing the way that
we really don&#39;t know much about our own Mangrove Kingfishers either
and we are all now learning that we don&#39;t!!!
Everyone who has contributed will have received the thanks with the
cc&#39;s, and will certainly keep you advised. I will now disappear until
the 5th in Madagascar when I will be re-attached to Wifi.
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Hi Brian,
&gt;
&gt; Please convey my sincere thanks to all who have contributed info about
&gt; this little-known kingfisher species. Replies have been hugely
&gt; interesting and its been evident to me that we all still have much to
&gt; learn about this sparsely populated bird, particularly with regard to
&gt; diet dependence in breeding and non-breeding seasons. One can also ask
&gt; why this species only occupies the east coast of Africa, and why its
&gt; never colonized part of the western side of this continent.
&gt;
&gt; Please keep me in the loop with any new information that may surface.
&gt;
&gt; Kind regards
&gt;
&gt; Hugh Chittenden

&gt;&gt; Thanks very much for this Neil.
&gt;&gt; As you say it is difficult to read into the monthly individual reports
&gt;&gt; without the added information of geographic distribution that shows
&gt;&gt; calendar distribution. I must admit I am intrigued by the spike in
&gt;&gt; October where it is nearly twice as much as the months either side of
&gt;&gt; it. I wonder if this marks the main departure southwards out of Kenya
&gt;&gt; and Somalia to breeding grounds further south, and the other spike in
&gt;&gt; April again nearly twice the number as the months either side mark the
&gt;&gt; return from the south. You must admit it looks very odd, and does fit
&gt;&gt; with what we are learning about movements in Kenya.
&gt;&gt; Just as a bye the bye, apart from Pemba and maybe Mafia are you aware
&gt;&gt; of many breeding records in Tz?
&gt;&gt; Best for now
&gt;&gt; Brian
