  <pre>Hi Colin,
I&#39;m in Mad. at present and for next five weeks but wifi tonight!
I wanted to thank you for all your very interesting latest input. The
dates on that bird retrapped 13 times, do they suggest a double
passage? It could help us learn a lot. In fact all the retrap details
contribute to the bigger picture. Do any individuals stake out a
non-breeding territory along the Watamu coast or are all on the move
to get elsewhere?
It would be very nice to see a map of dated distributions from atlas
data, I am pretty confident that it will confirm what we are learning
about it being a migrant late March-early Dec but records outside of
this period are the exception whilst any breeding records are
exceptional!
Best for now
Brian
