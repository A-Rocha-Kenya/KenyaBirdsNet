  <pre>Thanks so much for this Graeme. I can&#39;t remember what year it was but
I can still clearly remember watching one fly into a net and pulling
it out, and up to Sunday it was the only one I had ever seen. I was
ecstatic!
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Hello Everyone,
&gt;
&gt; A bit more info on this super species: we’ve ringed a total of 16
&gt; Palaearctic Scops at Ngulia between 1979 and the present, singles in every
&gt; year it has occurred except for the three in 1985, and in 1996.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,

&gt;&gt; Hi Brian,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s a great find for the Finch Pentad and Nairobi National Park.
&gt;&gt; Congratulations!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In your letter for your 3 March 2019 visit to NNP, you state, &#34; The
&gt;&gt; closest
&gt;&gt; northwards, is Samburu District NE of Mt Kenya.&#34;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Recall that I saw Otus scops and recorded its loud call Lolldaiga Hills
&gt;&gt; Ranch (Laikipia County, ca. 20 km off the NW side of Mt. Kenya) at 2130 m
&gt;&gt; asl in cedar-olive-acokcanthera-euclea open woodland on 4 May 2017 (this
&gt;&gt; is at the Main House...where I live).  I need to get back to my notes,
&gt;&gt; but, best as I recall, I&#39;d heard this bird calling (&#39;peeeeuu&#39;) for a few
&gt;&gt; months before finally seeing and recording it.  I heard this owl, and
&gt;&gt; searched for it perhaps 30X before finally seeing it.  Call most often
&gt;&gt; heard just after dark...about 19:10 h.  It gave the species-typical
&gt;&gt; &#39;peeeeuu&#39; 2X or 3X, spaced ca. 7 seconds apart...then either flew off
&gt;&gt; immediately (I got glimpses) or (perhaps) remained perched and quiet.  As
&gt;&gt; such, very hard to see.  4 May 2017 was the first time I became aware that
&gt;&gt; a pair was present, as they were dueting ca. 5 m apart (1 series of ca.
&gt;&gt; 40X duets);  one giving the typical &#39;loud call&#39;/&#39;territorial call&#39; (&#39;tooo&#39;
&gt;&gt; or &#39;peeeeuu&#39;) followed by the &#39;fledgling begging call&#39; (a raspy &#39;kuurp&#39;)
&gt;&gt; as often recorded in Europe:  www.xeno-cento.org/species/otus-scops)
&gt;&gt; &lt;http://www.xeno-cento.org/species/otus-scops)&gt;.  They apparently departed
&gt;&gt; soon after this (perhaps even that night)...as I did not hear any calls
&gt;&gt; after 4 May 2017.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I also heard this bird many times at the Main House during ca. April-May
&gt;&gt; 2016...but was never able to see it.  It was my &#39;Mystery Bird&#39; for 2
&gt;&gt; years.  I did not hear this species during 2018, and have not heard it
&gt;&gt; this year.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Looking at what notes that I do have at hand, I see that Darcy Ogada said
&gt;&gt; that she saw an Otus scops at Thika on 9 November 2018...also north of
&gt;&gt; NNP. This bird dragged into a house by a cat....where it died.
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt; NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 3rd MARCH 2019
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 4 EURASIAN SCOPS OWL
&gt;&gt; This is the first ever record of a Scops Owl in the Park. It is also
&gt;&gt; the 474th species for “Finch Pentad.” There is only one feature in the
&gt;&gt; field that separates Eurasian from African Scops Owl, and that is
&gt;&gt; whether the 10th Primary is longer than the 5th (Eurasian) or shorter
&gt;&gt; than 5th (African). The wing-shape is very important if you are a
&gt;&gt; long-distance migrant, or a stay at home! So we paid special attention
&gt;&gt; to this feature, and the 10th is longer than 5th, even reaching the
&gt;&gt; tip of the tail. Nairobi is in a very large hole in the distribution
&gt;&gt; of African Scops Owl, and there are no records near here. The closest
&gt;&gt; northwards, is Samburu District NE of Mt Kenya, westwards it’s common
&gt;&gt; in the eastern Maasai Mara, eastwards not until reaching the
&gt;&gt; Tsavo-like habitat, and I have no idea where the closest birds are but
&gt;&gt; certainly well off the plateau. Then southwards, maps show it as
&gt;&gt; occurring along the extreme southern border with Tanzania. I have
&gt;&gt; never seen or heard it anywhere along the road to and including Magadi
&gt;&gt; or Natron, Southern White-faced is the only Scops representative.
&gt;&gt; Conversely Eurasian Scops have been examined in the hand from Mt Kenya
&gt;&gt; south to Nairobi (but not the Park), Limuru, Machakos and Kajiado. I
&gt;&gt; have no doubts that this is a Eurasian and not African Scops Owl. We
&gt;&gt; were in the car park at Ololo Lodge. It was the birds that found it
&gt;&gt; for us, and it was being mobbed by a variety of bush birds, whilst
&gt;&gt; looking for the instigator of the commotion we flushed the bird twice
&gt;&gt; and then it posed openly but in vine tangles and we got some nice
&gt;&gt; images.
