  <pre>Dear Martin.   I am sure every reader feels for you, after all the magnificent work you have done over the years to counter the bird-poisoning war that clearly still continues. If ever a person was more deserving of the title “ WILDLIFE WARRIOR” you are that person, and I hope Paula Kahumba and others duly recognise that.

Clearly the bird-poisoning war will continue not just in Kenya but all over Africa.  Its one of those cultural things that will take generations to eradicate. However you have achieved so much already, please do not give up.

With very best wishes
Don Turner
