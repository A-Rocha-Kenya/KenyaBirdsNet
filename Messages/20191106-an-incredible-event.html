  <pre>Dear All,
It&#39;s difficult to describe the effect that just happened. A male
Crowned Eagle came over the house, it was silent until almost overhead
when it started displaying and giving its call.
It is a fairly hot clear day, and most birds have gone quiet, as the
Eagle started to call it was picked up immediately and perfectly
imitated by every Rueppell&#39;s Robin-Chat in the vicinity. It was
somewhat eerie, but begs the question Why do they do it? The Eagle
moved back over IUCN, and is presumably breeding somewhere close.

Best to all
Brian
