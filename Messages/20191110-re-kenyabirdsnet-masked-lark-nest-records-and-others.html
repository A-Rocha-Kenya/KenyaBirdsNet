We tried to follow but never got a clue where the nest was.<br>&gt; Not far later an individual took off about 2mtr from my foot and there was a<br>&gt; nest with two eggs. About 3cm deep and 3 wide (internally) attached is the<br>&gt; foto of the nest.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Then later during the day while photographing Bristle-crowned Starlings<br>&gt; feeding together with White-crowned Starling realized one wasn’t super<br>&gt; active like the others and never flew away while others did. I checked just<br>&gt; to find the immature bird was full of ticks only on the head. I extracted<br>&gt; about two dozens of ticks and there were quite a lot of tiny ones that my<br>&gt; fat fingers would not remove. Never seen a bird before infested by the large<br>&gt; “cow” tick. And the bird looked petty weak.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Other nesting records includes last year in Nov an Abbort’s Starling nesting<br>&gt; on the same tree with Silvery-cheeked Hornbill in Castle Forest, 3 weeks ago<br>&gt; while catching white-eyes for research work was another nest of<br>&gt; Silvery-cheeked Hornbill in Castle Lodge and one seen along the road<br>&gt; collecting mud and flying a different direction from the current nest<br>&gt; meaning there must be another pair breeding.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Many thanks and best regards<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; chege<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &lt;http://www.birdwatchingeastafrica.com/&gt; Birdwatching East Africa –<br>&gt; birding, wildlife &amp; photo tours<br>&gt;<br>&gt; P.O.

It was also good to show him just<br>&gt; how good “Finch Pentad” really is, and how it really is the runawayst<br>&gt; wishes<br>&gt;<br>&gt; chege<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; contender for the richest avian diversity for a 9 km sided square, on<br>&gt; the whole African continent. Before Nigel arrived I had recorded<br>&gt; Black-headed Oriole and Black-collared Apalis, two species we were<br>&gt; otherwise, not encountering today amongst the staggering 170 other<br>&gt; species we were to record just in that one Pentad. This morning (5th)<br>&gt; by 8.00am, in our paddock as well as the two species yesterday, I had<br>&gt; African Goshawk, Gymnogene, Barn Owl, our lost Golden-tailed<br>&gt; Woodpecker, the season’s first Blackcap, (which was the only<br>&gt; Palearctic apart from Eurasian Bee-eater and Barn Swallow),<br>&gt; Yellow-whiskered Greenbul, White-starred Robin and Parrot-billed<br>&gt; Sparrow and the most staggering of all the misses yesterday<br>&gt; Emerald-spotted Wood-Dove! I will take a few forays out during the<br>&gt; course of today to see if there are any more additions, as a few<br>&gt; common species are not revealing their presence.<br>&gt; Back to NNP, we covered all the accessible squares in the Park,<br>&gt; closing the days total for species inside the Park at 206. There were<br>&gt; no particularly unusual finds, but it was a very good day.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; We met up with Sidney, at 6.45am and being a Monday there was no<br>&gt; queue, and after completing the formalities we had a walk around the<br>&gt; car-park before going in. Species in the car-park not recorded later<br>&gt; were Cinnamon-chested Bee-eater, Snowy Barbet, Green-backed Honeybird,<br>&gt; Brown-backed Woodpecker and Northern Double-collared Sunbird.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; It was quiet driving down to Ivory Burning Site, and rather dull there<br>&gt; as well, but the Zanzibar Greenbuls were singing well and the seasons<br>&gt; first Black Stork flew by. Nagalomon Dam had a rise in water, and the<br>&gt; island appears to be getting smaller, there were only a couple of<br>&gt; immature Black-crowned Night-Herons, a black-billed Great Egret was<br>&gt; present also, ten African Darters of which a few appeared to be on<br>&gt; nests, an adult Fish Eagle was keeping watch and the only migrant<br>&gt; waders here were a couple of Black-winged Stilts, Green Sandpiper and<br>&gt; a Common Sandpiper. A possible Marsh Warbler crossed from the dense<br>&gt; scrub on one side of the road to equally dense cover on the other, but<br>&gt; not seen thereafter. White-rumped Swifts were flying around the<br>&gt; Mokoyeti bridge at the outlet to the dam, and by now, it was time to<br>&gt; take the back road to Hyena Dam.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; We were finding a good number of birds along here, one flying eaglet<br>&gt; was at the Fish Eagles nest, one of just two Augur Buzzards, a<br>&gt; Red-faced Cisticola at the creek was important as it meant that we<br>&gt; finished the day with all ten Cisticola species, and this is the most<br>&gt; unreliable. There were male Red-collared Widowbirds in colour but with<br>&gt; brownish edgings to the wings, at the units the House Sparrows,<br>&gt; Village Indigobirds etc., were waiting for us, but also a Spotted<br>&gt; Flycatcher and the first Tree Pipit for the season. Just before<br>&gt; arriving at Hyena Dam we broke the news to Sidney that our tradition<br>&gt; was that we do not eat breakfast until we can leave Hyena Dam with 100<br>&gt; species recorded up to there, we left Hyena Dam with 115. The dam had<br>&gt; another Fish Eagle, eight Black-winged Stilts, a pair of Long-toed<br>&gt; Plovers, the seasons first Common Snipe, Greenshank, ten Wood, three<br>&gt; Green and two Common Sandpipers, a few Barn Swallows and a Sand Martin<br>&gt; resting amongst the numerous Plain Martins present, and finally three<br>&gt; Greater Blue-eared Starlings.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Taking the circuit along the Mokoyeti we picked up African Water Rail<br>&gt; at the oxbow, another Black Stork, a lone Marabou on the vlei, also<br>&gt; still present in the evening and it was the only one seen all day! The<br>&gt; first few of over a dozen Black-winged Kites seen today, the days only<br>&gt; Wire-tailed Swallow, a Nightingale flew off the side of the road near<br>&gt; the Mokoyeti Bridge and sat for a while in a bush, a seasonal first,<br>&gt; but no Nightingales were heard anywhere. Back at Nagalomon Dam was the<br>&gt; days first African Spoonbill.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; We set off for Kingfisher Picnic Site, but detoured to drive through<br>&gt; the forest section just on top of the Kisembe plateau, in the forest<br>&gt; we found the first of three Tawny Eagles for the day, as well as<br>&gt; Narina Trogon, Yellow-rumped Tinkerbird, Cabanis’ Greenbul, White-eyed<br>&gt; Slaty Flycatcher, Willow Warbler and Black-and-White Mannikin, all of<br>&gt; which were not encountered again. We also found a party of another<br>&gt; four Tree Pipits. As time was running away now we did not take the<br>&gt; road alongside the Kingfisher Swamp, added a few at the picnic site<br>&gt; but strangely not Red-throated Tit, and Banded but not Brown Parisoma!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; As we passed the old burnt area there were a pair of Shelley’s<br>&gt; Francolins, and the season’s first Booted Eagle, a pale bird. Another<br>&gt; seasonal first was a young Isabelline Shrike with the only rufous<br>&gt; being the tail, and a second similar bird seen later near “The<br>&gt; Beacon.” On the road to Ololo we had a pair of Secretarybirds with one<br>&gt; on a nest atop a Balanites, a male Bateleur, a pair of White-bellied<br>&gt; Bustards, the seasons first Isabelline Wheatear and the only wheatear<br>&gt; of the day, a few Speckle-fronted and ten Grey-headed Social-Weavers.<br>&gt; Because it was 1 pm now, much later than we usually arrive at Ololo,<br>&gt; it was quiet but Brown Parisomas were noisy and so was a Greater<br>&gt; Honeyguide. Towards Leopard Cliffs were a few Eurasian Bee-eaters,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The late hour also meant no singing Pallid Honeyguide below Baboon<br>&gt; Cliffs although the Lesser in the same fig, was very vocal, and nearby<br>&gt; the young Martial Eagle was on its nest.<br>&gt; Climbing the hill away from the Mbagathi we had a lone Grey-headed<br>&gt; Silverbill, but more interestingly it was carrying nesting material<br>&gt; and although African Silverbill has nested in the Park, Grey-headed<br>&gt; has never suggested that it did though I suppose we should not be too<br>&gt; surprised. In the woodland above Hippo Pools we had the first Spotted<br>&gt; Thick-knee recorded at this site, a Long-billed Pipit and several more<br>&gt; Speckle-fronted Weavers, whilst along the river we found the season’s<br>&gt; first Steppe Eagle, and likewise first Red-backed Shrikes with two<br>&gt; adult males and a female, followed by the first Whinchat and another<br>&gt; three different birds seen around the dam near the Empakasi junction.<br>&gt; Whilst not following all of the Rhino Circuit because of recent<br>&gt; flooding we drove into the woodland as far as enough to find three<br>&gt; Red-throated Tits and Lesser Masked Weaver, and also entered Athi Dam<br>&gt; from the west side as the Pipeline road access would almost certainly<br>&gt; be treacherous. The water level was well up and only fragments of<br>&gt; margin, otherwise the water was in the vegetation. Species found<br>&gt; included four White-faced Whistling-Ducks, a couple of Yellow-billed<br>&gt; Storks were the only Storks present, a couple of African Spoonbills<br>&gt; and Black-crowned Night-Herons, a Striated Heron, Great Egret, a<br>&gt; drinking Secretarybird, adult Fish Eagle, Lappet-faced Vulture, four<br>&gt; Water and one Spotted Thick-knee, only four Black-winged Stilts, a<br>&gt; Marsh Sandpiper, three Greenshanks, two Little Stints and three Ruffs,<br>&gt; and the best bird being an adult Whiskered Tern. Banded Parisoma and<br>&gt; Lesser Masked Weavers were in the mellifera stands.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On the return which was rather hurried as we were getting late, a<br>&gt; Little Grebe on the Vulture Drinking Pools and a couple of Banded<br>&gt; Martins over the adjacent grassland, on flooded ground near “The<br>&gt; Beacon” were pairs of Yellow-billed Duck and Red-billed Teal, another<br>&gt; Shelley’s Francolin, and in another flooded area, an adult Martial<br>&gt; Eagle standing in water where the only prey could have been frogs!<br>&gt; Also a pair of Pangani Longclaws in the grasslands, at Karen PS Dam<br>&gt; another White-faced Whistling Duck, a male Pallid Harrier and<br>&gt; Rosy-breasted Longclaw when almost back to the Hyena Dam run-off where<br>&gt; there was a superb sight of three adult and one immature Black Storks<br>&gt; by the road. The first pair of Grey Crowned Cranes at last made<br>&gt; appearance with another pair on the way to Langata Gate, and for the<br>&gt; up to now missing Black Crake today we stopped back at the Oxbow along<br>&gt; the upper Mokoyeti, and called one out with the App!!!<br>&gt; It was fairly uneventful on the way to Langata Gate where we exited at<br>&gt; 5.50pm.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Some muddy sections had not dried out after the rains last week, and<br>&gt; could be hazardous.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Mammals were widespread with no major concentrations, apart from Athi<br>&gt; Basin and adjacent river.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The Gladiolus that used to be ukambensis is having a major flowering<br>&gt; whilst altogether the flowers are not very impressive in spite of the<br>&gt; heavy rains.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Best to all<br>&gt; Brian<br>&gt;<br>&gt; KEY TO MONTAGE<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 1 YELLOW-BILLED DUCK<br>&gt; Only one pair seen, but unusual to have them at nearly eye-level. An<br>&gt; underrated attractive duck.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 2 COMMON WAXBILL<br>&gt; Very common, but the pattern in breeding is very intricate and not<br>&gt; often appreciated.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 3 BOOTED EAGLE<br>&gt; Small numbers winter locally, and this is the first to arrive back in<br>&gt; NNP this season.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 4 ISABELLINE SHRIKE<br>&gt; Two red-tailed shrike types were seen today and in both the patterns<br>&gt; were similar. The only rufous on the bird is the tail, and the bird<br>&gt; is quite attractively marked.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 5 BLACK STORK<br>&gt; These four were together where the stream that crosses the Hyena Dam<br>&gt; run-off crosses the road.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 6 WATER THICK-KNEE<br>&gt; This is three of the four seen at Athi Dam.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<o:p></o:p></p></div><div><p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'><o:p></o:p></span></p></div></div></body></html>
