  <pre>Wow Mustafa,
That is very impressive, I honestly did not know that there were so
many interesting areas on the south coast that I was never aware of.
Very interesting and thanks for sharing,
Brian

&gt; Greetings everyone
&gt;
&gt; South coast waterfowl counts were conducted on Sunday 17th Feb. We started
&gt; our day at a swamp behind kenya bixa in Tiwi, we had a great number of
&gt; pygmy geese and little grebe, a new record for me in South coast was
&gt; white-backed duck and garganey(pictures attached), also seen were
&gt; intermediate egret, grey, purple and great white egret. Interesting land
&gt; birds were northern wheatear and black-collared barbet. We then went to
&gt; Mkurumudzi river estuary, which is like a second mida creek, lots of crab
&gt; plovers(picture attached), many small waders, lots of reed cormorants, a
&gt; big roost of terns and gulls and a good number of Palm-nut vultures(8)! The
&gt; days only osprey was seen at KISCOL DAM with 2 African darters and a couple
&gt; of reed cormorants and cattle egret. We finished the day with the KISCOL
&gt; swamp, seeing lots of openbill storks, again many pygmy geese, some African
&gt; jacana, two purple heron and the days only black crake and pied kingfisher.
&gt; Reed cormorants, black headed herons and cattle egrets were also seen
&gt; roosting in the reeds. Also attached is a spreadsheet picture of the
&gt; counts. In the end we managed to log around 120 species in 2 full protocols
&gt; and 3 adhocs.
