  <div dir="auto">Dear Don,<div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">I have only the one record of a dark morph and I&#39;m quite certain it was a Levaillant&quot;s. It was a first for me and immediately recognized as larger than a Jacobin.

      <p><div dir="auto"><div dir="auto">Dear All.  Dark-morph coastal cuckoos are confusing and present major identification problems.<div><br></div><div>I refer to the all-dark “crested&quot; cuckoo that appears to be present (March-September) in coastal East Africa from the Rufiji Delta in coastal Tanzania north to the Malindi area of coastal Kenya.  </div><div><br></div><div>QUESTION:  Is it the dark morph southern form <i>serratus</i> of Jacobin Cuckoo, or is it a dark morph Levaillant’s Cuckoo ?</div><div><br></div><div>All seem to have a small white wing patch, while white tail tips are present in some and not in others. Under tail of some may show some white.</div><div><br></div><div>Has anyone seen this dark morph during the period November - February ?? ( allowing for stragglers to occur in April and October).</div><div><br></div><div>All this beggars the question:  If all known records fall between March-September, then odds are that IT IS a dark Jacobin Cuckoo, but if there are some November-February records then odds point to a resident form of Levaillant&#39;s, which in itself would be unusual as Levaillvant&#39;s is strictly a “rains” migrant throughout, and November-February is a largely hot dry period at the coast. </div><div><br></div><div>If, as most books say, it is a dark morph of Levaillant’s Cuckoo, why is this dark morph NOT seen anywhere else in East Africa or even anywhere in the rest of Africa; or is there a dark morph elsewhere ????.</div><div><br></div><div>Dark <i>serratus</i> of Jacobin Cuckoo are largely coastal in South Africa with 50% of all birds in Natal this variety. It would make sense for this form to migrate north along the eastern seaboard of Africa during the April - September period, then back to Natal.  So any November-February records become all the more important.</div><div><br></div><div>Thoughts and records welcomed, also any dated photographs.</div><div><br></div><div>Best wishes</div><div>Don Turner</div></div></div></p>
