  <pre>Hi Jonathan,
I think your Grey Cuckoo-shrike has come down from higher levels like
Aberdares as with a number of elevation migrants escaping from the
cold, but is a great record. However I think you have an even rarer
record for the Nairobi district in that Black Heron. This species has
never been recorded in Nairobi National Park, and the closest I have
seen it is Naivasha where of course it is not a rarity, and Tana
Bridge on the Thika Road where before the floodplains were cultivated
it was regular,
Best for now
Brian

&gt; That’s a great find!
&gt;
&gt; Grey Cuckooshrikes were resident in Karura Forest in the past, but I have
&gt; not seen one recently. It’s good to know they are still in or near Nairobi!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I wonder whether it came down from highland forest because of the cold
&gt; season?
&gt;
&gt; Best wishes, Fleur

&gt;&gt; Today 4th August 2019 we had an early bird watching me and guest starting
&gt;&gt; at 6.48 am, the sun raise was so beautiful from our main entrance to the
&gt;&gt; reception on Acacia tree birds active was so live on the branches, We saw
&gt;&gt; a Chin - spot Batis  Olive Thrush, Commo Bulbul and 20 lesser striped
&gt;&gt; swallows on the roof at least 13 sitting and 7 other were flying feeding.
&gt;&gt; We proceeded to the Forest on the right side of the Jogging truck another
&gt;&gt; activities of water birds, Sacred Ibis, Great White Egret, Black Egret for
&gt;&gt; my first time at Windsor and the number of Reed cormorants were higher
&gt;&gt; than usual at least 42 on the trees Little grebe Yellow Bill Duck African
&gt;&gt; darta and Grey heron at the lake. As we proceeded to the Forest we had
&gt;&gt; another chance with feeding party after a walk where I was so challenged
&gt;&gt; with a bird till I share to my guest that I see a new bird here. First I
&gt;&gt; thought was White - eyed Slaghty Flycatcher but it’s movement on the tree
&gt;&gt; was strange, I had to check it again and again, the reason we had fog and
&gt;&gt; view was not clear. Finally I tracked it till I identified it to be Grey
&gt;&gt; cuckoo shrike.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Birders is the bird on the transit or is at the Migrating feeding zone
&gt;&gt; first time at Windsor it is my second time see it, first I saw it at
&gt;&gt; Arabuko Sokoke Forest mid 2000.
&gt;&gt; Keep birding
