  <pre>Thanks so much James,
I know about records from Kasarani, but never a suggestion that they
(or any others) had bred, has it been documented and I have missed it?
When you read up about the historical distribution, this is all
representing a first incursion into the Nairobi region, which is very
interesting,
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Dear Brian and All,
&gt;
&gt; As per Jennifer Oduori and James Kuria N&#39;dungu (and others), Shikra have
&gt; been breeding annually in the Makadara/Hamza area of Nairobi (between
&gt; Embakasi and Kasarani) for some years now. It&#39;s a regular bird in the SE
&gt; parts of the city with a few drifting westwards to the NNP and
&gt; Karen-Langata.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for sharing these nice records Brian.
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt;

&gt;&gt; Thanks so much for your update Mark, really interesting you have a
&gt;&gt; pair of Shikras on Maanzoni as well, it certainly suggests that they
&gt;&gt; are moving out of their vagrant status towards potentially rare
&gt;&gt; resident in this region. NNP has had just three singles ever.
&gt;&gt; Really sorry you were not with us, even without the three major
&gt;&gt; surprises, and of course the abysmal presence of migrants it was one
&gt;&gt; of those truly exceptional days with constantly new birds appearing
&gt;&gt; the entire time we were there.
&gt;&gt; Best for now
&gt;&gt; Brian

&gt;&gt; All,
&gt;&gt; My patch is the next door pentad to Lukenya at Maanzoni.
&gt;&gt; I too have had a pair of Shikra on my dam, both this year and last year.
&gt;&gt; So maybe we have a trend!
&gt;&gt; Mortified I couldn’t join you for the Levant, as I visit Lukenya
&gt;&gt; pretty regularly.
