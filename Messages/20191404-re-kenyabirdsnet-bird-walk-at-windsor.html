      <p>Hi Jonathan,<br>
I think your Grey Cuckoo-shrike has come down from higher levels like<br>
Aberdares as with a number of elevation migrants escaping from the<br>
cold, but is a great record. However I think you have an even rarer<br>
record for the Nairobi district in that Black Heron. This species has<br>
never been recorded in Nairobi National Park, and the closest I have<br>
seen it is Naivasha where of course it is not a rarity, and Tana<br>
Bridge on the Thika Road where before the floodplains were cultivated<br>
it was regular,<br>
Best for now<br>
Brian<br>

&gt; That’s a great find!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Grey Cuckooshrikes were resident in Karura Forest in the past, but I have<br>
&gt; not seen one recently. It’s good to know they are still in or near Nairobi!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I wonder whether it came down from highland forest because of the cold<br>
&gt; season?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Best wishes, Fleur<br>

&gt;&gt; Today 4th August 2019 we had an early bird watching me and guest starting<br>
&gt;&gt; at 6.48 am, the sun raise was so beautiful from our main entrance to the<br>
&gt;&gt; reception on Acacia tree birds active was so live on the branches, We saw<br>
&gt;&gt; a Chin - spot Batis  Olive Thrush, Commo Bulbul and 20 lesser striped<br>
&gt;&gt; swallows on the roof at least 13 sitting and 7 other were flying feeding.<br>
&gt;&gt; We proceeded to the Forest on the right side of the Jogging truck another<br>
&gt;&gt; activities of water birds, Sacred Ibis, Great White Egret, Black Egret for<br>
&gt;&gt; my first time at Windsor and the number of Reed cormorants were higher<br>
&gt;&gt; than usual at least 42 on the trees Little grebe Yellow Bill Duck African<br>
&gt;&gt; darta and Grey heron at the lake. As we proceeded to the Forest we had<br>
&gt;&gt; another chance with feeding party after a walk where I was so challenged<br>
&gt;&gt; with a bird till I share to my guest that I see a new bird here. First I<br>
&gt;&gt; thought was White - eyed Slaghty Flycatcher but it’s movement on the tree<br>
&gt;&gt; was strange, I had to check it again and again, the reason we had fog and<br>
&gt;&gt; view was not clear. Finally I tracked it till I identified it to be Grey<br>
&gt;&gt; cuckoo shrike.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Birders is the bird on the transit or is at the Migrating feeding zone<br>
&gt;&gt; first time at Windsor it is my second time see it, first I saw it at<br>
&gt;&gt; Arabuko Sokoke Forest mid 2000.<br>
&gt;&gt; Keep birding<br>
