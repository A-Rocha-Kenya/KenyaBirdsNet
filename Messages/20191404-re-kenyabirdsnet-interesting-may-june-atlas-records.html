  <pre>Hi Ben,
Oh I see. So I identified a Common Snipe of Washington&#39;s, I had
assumed the Kingfisher bird had come to the ground as I had not
received any photos of the bird on the bush so only commented on what
was attached.
This leaves a bit of a quandary now as I now fully agree with
Washington that the perched bird is very grey, almost certainly far
too much for a spring plumaged Common Snipe, also there is great
contrast between the cold grey upperparts and the very white
underparts... and I must go with NNP&#39;s first documented record of an
African Snipe, and of course a Pentad first... thankyou, it&#39;s made it
the 488th for the list, not sure what it is for NNP as it hasn&#39;t been
calculated for quite a while.
So I did a fairly thorough search through the literature and on the
net, and nowhere at all can I find that there has been any reference
to an African Snipe perched calling bird like this (whilst normal in
Common Snipe) off the ground. So I am going to ask the South Africans
to comment on this, with your images.
Best for now
Brian

&gt; The snipe was no longer around when we looked on Sunday!

&gt; Greetings birders,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks Sidney for sharing these exciting records. Below are a few more:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 1. On behalf of Ben Allen, Jennifer Oduori and myself, a Common Snipe –
&gt; which should be thousands of miles away on its breeding grounds in Northern
&gt; Europe and Asia – singing (if repeated, monotonous pip pip pip pip can be
&gt; called singing) from an Acacia at the swamp near Kingfisher Picnic site on
&gt; 23 June 2019. Photo by Ben Allen..
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 2. On behalf of Peter and Ann Usher and Sukhy and Jaytinder Soin, the fabled
&gt; Quail-plover in hiding. Photo by Peter Usher.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 3. Finally on June 29, with the Nature Kenya and Dakatcha Woodland
&gt; Conservation Group team, we visited Bura oxbow lake and Gandini wetland,
&gt; north of River Galana-Sabaki near the town of Garashi. At Bura oxbow lake
&gt; there were expanses of white water lilies and thousands of ducks – at least
&gt; 500 White-faced Whistling Ducks and 500 Fulvous Whistling Ducks, as well as
&gt; Spur-winged Geese and Knob-billed Ducks – many African Open-billed Storks,
&gt; and a variety of other birds, including Squacco Heron, African Fish Eagle,
&gt; Black-winged Stilt, Jacobin Cuckoo, Brown-headed Parrot and Mangrove
&gt; Kingfisher.. At the smaller, shallower Gandini wetland, the birds were fewer
&gt; but almost entirely different, and included Pink-backed Pelican,
&gt; Yellow-billed Stork, Great White Egret, Little Egret, Glossy Ibis and
&gt; African Spoonbill. In the forest and bush Black-bellied Starlings gathered
&gt; in noisy flocks and we had brief views of gorgeous African Golden Orioles.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Wishing you good birding, Fleur
&gt;
