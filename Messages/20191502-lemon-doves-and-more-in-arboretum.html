  <pre>Greetings birders

Nature Kenya’s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk had an especially good walk in the Nairobi Arboretum today. “Shy” Lemon Doves walked down the path right in front of us! “Don’t even try to find it” Yellow-whiskered Greenbul was seen twice. Hartlaub’s Turaco foraged low in the bushes. A pair of Green Sandpiper, a pair of African Black Duck and a pair of Mountain Wagtail were seen in the river whose quality seems to have improved. And sharp-eyed observers glimpsed a Common (Steppe) Buzzard in the sky.

Wishing you good birding,

Fleur
