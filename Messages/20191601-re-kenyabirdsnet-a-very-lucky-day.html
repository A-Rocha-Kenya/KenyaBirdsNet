    <p>Mustafa - definitely an awesome day of birding! Interesting
      you've got the Carmine Bee-eaters there - we've had a couple of
      records some weeks back and nothing since here in Watamu. Wader
      numbers are really building up nicely now, however though we've
      not had an 'Oik' (Oystercatcher) here for a few years now... <br>
    </p>
    <p>Other news from the north coast... I was at Short Beach at the
      end of the Watamu peninsula on Sunday to try and bring my atlas
      card list up to at least 50 species and had a mixed flock of
      Lesser Masked Weaver, Red-billed Quelea, Fire-fronted Bishop and
      Black-winged Bishop - the latter two are not unique but certainly
      are not common along the beach front and my first for probably at
      least two years in Watamu. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Reasonable numbers of Common Tern passing Watamu right now as
      well. Terns on Whale Island have finished and gone. A dire
      breeding season for them in the end - I estimate probably a max of
      100 chicks fledged of Roseate Terns - and actually probably more
      like 70-80. Most nests were abandoned in early August. Not sure
      why, but I suspect the unusually strong winds and some heavy rain
      that we had around then must have hit the colony when there was
      perhaps a disturbance and most nests failed. <br>
    </p>
    <p>A Rocha is pushing on with purchasing land to create the A Rocha
      Dakatcha Nature Reserve in Dakatcha for the Sokoke Scops Owl and
      Golden-rumped Sengi (Elephant-shrew). We've managed to secure
      c.1,000 acres now and continue to negotiate for the remaining
      forest which still holds the owl and sengi in that area. We've now
      got images of the Sengi from camera traps from three different
      locations as well as a number of sight records too. Probably the
      most surprising record for the five days we were surveying there a
      couple of weeks ago was a displaying Crowned Eagle - somewhere it
      must have a nest, but it was very high and could have come from
      anywhere within 10 kms probably. The forest is being cleared at a
      terrifying rate - comparison of satellite images from 2017 to 2019
      shows large tracts of forest cleared and burnt for pineapples
      which are used for 3 years and abandoned for fresh forest land.
      It's definitely a race against time. I was also reminded how
      interesting it is that Dakatcha is basically a similar habitat to
      Arabuko-Sokoke and only c.30km north and yet there are a host of
      species missing - Green Barbet, Pale Batis, Forest Batis, Tiny
      Greenbul, Fischer's Greenbul, Terrestrial Brownbul, Dark-backed
      Weaver, Amani Sunbird - even Olive Sunbird we didn't see or hear
      once in 5 days (though it has been recorded in the IBA elsewhere).
      We did have daily records of Sokoke Pipit, however, but overall
      there is a whole suite of species that it appears the Sabaki River
      forms a very effective barrier to... Scope for some interesting
      research there!</p>

            <div dir="auto">Greetings all,
              <div dir="auto"><br>
              </div>
              <div dir="auto">I hosted a Saturday morning birdwalk at
                Tiwi pond on the 28th of September. We started early at
                7:30am. A flock of Northern carmine bee-eaters were the
                first birds we saw as we branched off the main road,
                with an adult feeding a young bird(pic attached). On
                reaching the pond, we saw it was full with water lilies
                and the water level was a bit higher due to a rainy
                week. The resident African jacana, <span
                  style="font-family:sans-serif;">African pygmy geese </span>and
                Little grebes were the first birds we saw. The grasses
                close to the waters edge had quite a few common
                waxbills, Bronze and B&amp;W mannikins, zanzibar bishops
                and pin-tailed whydahs. As we searched for the resident
                white-backed ducks amongst the water lilies. I spotted a
                smallish jacana, which at first I thought was a young
                African Jacana. But on closer inspection, turned out to
                be a Lesser Jacana!!(pic attached) We all enjoyed
                watching this rarity feed alone for quite a while,
                before it disappeared into the tall grasses. Other birds
                we saw were: White-faced whistling ducks, Black kite,
                Common and wood sandpipers, greenshanks, ringed plovers,
                wooly-necked storks, grey and purple herons, a painted
                snipe and an Immature Palm-nut vulture soaring above.
                The small forest patch on the far side of the pond gave
                us: yellow-bellied greenbuls, broadbilled roller, lizard
                buzzard, Little sparrowhawk, silvery-cheecked hornbills
                and East coast boubou. </div>
              <div dir="auto">In the afternoon (around 4pm) I visited
                the Kongo estuary, it was full of people and I wasn't
                expecting to see much, I couldn't have been more wrong!
                Just close to the river inlet a group of small waders
                were resting(pic attached), they included: common and
                curlew sandpipers, greater and lesser sandplovers, ruddy
                turnstones, sanderlings. As I watched them I saw a bird
                with a very flappy flight, flying over me, I quickly
                took some shots with my camera and turned out it was a
                Eurasian Oystercatcher(pic attached), I had seen the
                last one in early 2017. I proceeded to walk towards Tiwi
                beach and saw another group of waders many were the same
                with an addition of grey plovers, whimbrels, and a
                Bar-tailed godwit(pic attached). Not wanting to disturb
                the flock I started walking back, when 2 Crab plovers
                flew over the surf and landed on the beach just ahead of
                me(pic attached). </div>
              <div dir="auto">It's definitely the first time I've seen
                such a number of special waders pass by Diani on a busy
                Saturday afternoon. Sorry for such a long story, but
                thank you for reading it.</div>
