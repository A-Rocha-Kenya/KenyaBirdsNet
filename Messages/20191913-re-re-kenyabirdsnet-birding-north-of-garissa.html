  <pre>Thanks Chege.  What a great selection of birds with “all white” underparts, clearly so different from the Loiyengalani to Kapedo birds, also so very different from nominate Somali in northern Somalia, and from the Van Someren museum specimens from Marsabit south to Laisamis and Archer’s Post.

In addition we have what appears to be an expanding hybrid (House x Somali) population turning up at Moyale, El Wak, Kapedo, north of Garissa and Sala Gate, Tsavo East NP, in fact anywhere where the two meet.  

Clearly the Somali Sparrow in Kenya is in need of some review.

Don
