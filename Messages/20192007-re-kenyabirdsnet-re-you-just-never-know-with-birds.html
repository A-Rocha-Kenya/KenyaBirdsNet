  <pre>Thanks so much Don,
It&#39;s a very smart bird, incredibly tame, thanks for letting me know.
Is semicaerulea the race that is a migrant into Oman as well, and
southern Arabia? There&#39;s nothing that helps really in Handbook BOA, I
think the race had not been described at the time of publication,
Very best
Brian

&gt; Dear Brian.  Great photos of your Grey-headed Kingfisher the other morning.
&gt; The brown not grey head, also the dark chestnut belly CLEARLY distinguish
&gt; this individual as a northern migrant. Possibly race semicaerulea which I
&gt; think has reached the Tana River.  Its home is in the Yemen and Eritrean
&gt; coast.
