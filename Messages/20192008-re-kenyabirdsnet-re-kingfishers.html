  <pre>I don&#39;t believe the details of the race were checked at the time, Brian 
- but I am pretty certain it would be the migratory natalensis - same as 
we have in Watamu. (does the resident race occur on the coast?? not sure 
it does - though Don would be able to tell us, I&#39;m sure...)

&gt; That&#39;s an interesting incident Colin, do we know what race? Nothing
&gt; will ever beat the Belgians that pulled that Marsh Warbler out of a
&gt; net at Ngulia with a ring on it, put there by themselves in Belgium
&gt; earlier in the season though!
&gt; Best for now

&gt;&gt; ....and, whilst not a long-distance recovery, there was an African Pygmy

&gt;&gt; c.1994 by Waiyaki of Ornithology Dept that he then controlled himself in
&gt;&gt; a different Kaya c.40kms away. Not sure if that ever was reported to the
&gt;&gt; Scheme, Graeme? Quite probably not. Hopefully as we get to digitising
&gt;&gt; the ringing data, this will come to light - and others like it.
&gt;&gt; Actually, if I remember right, Waiyaki didn&#39;t realise it was a control
&gt;&gt; when he caught the ringed bird and it was only when schedules were being
&gt;&gt; written up much later than it was realised it had been ringed in a
&gt;&gt; different forest patch!. I forget the details of actual dates and which
&gt;&gt; kayas were involved - someone at Ornithology could probably hunt them down.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear All,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; There are three ringing recoveries of Afrotropical kingfishers that I
&gt;&gt;&gt; know of affecting East Africa.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Two Grey-headed, both ringed in Ethiopia by the late John Ash; one
&gt;&gt;&gt; (ringed 16 Oct 1970, 7°36N) was caught by a ringer at Masogo near
&gt;&gt;&gt; Kisumu, Kenya on 19 Nov 1976; the other (ringed 4 Oct 1974, 11°34N)
&gt;&gt;&gt; was found dead at Zombo near Mombasa, Kenya on 1 Mar 1975.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; A Pied Kingfisher ringed in Ethiopia, 8°N, 21 Jul 1970 was caught at
&gt;&gt;&gt; Lake Kyogo, Uganda, in Nov 1971.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Graeme
