  <pre>Hi Shailesh,
Thanks for stressing that we take an interest in the large gulls we
see in East Africa. I currently have four nominate Caspian Gull
records in with the East African Rarities Committee awaiting
consideration, one Kenyan and three Ugandan. But also have another
half-dozen records to submit later that may involve Steppe and
Yellow-legged Gulls. For the people that went to see the Caspian Tern
at Lake Naivasha in May 2018, and saw a larger and paler-backed gull
with the Baltic (Lesser Black-backed Gulls) images of this bird have
been sent to Klaus Malling Olsen who authored the gull book you are
referring to, and his response was that this can only be a
Yellow-legged Gull!
Best for now
Brian
