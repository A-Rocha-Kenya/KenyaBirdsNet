  <pre>Greetings birders

It was hot, dry and dusty, but it was April, and Nature Kenya’s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk had its best total ever at Paradise Lost, just over the city boundary in Kiambu – 94 species! (This beats the total of 93 recorded at more or less the same season at the hillside with seasonal wetlands in Langata, which has become a block of flats.) Highlights included:

Migrants:
Common (Steppe) Buzzard
Eurasian Bee-eater
Barn Swallow
Willow Warbler
Common Whitethroat
Common Nightingale
Spotted Flycatcher
Tree Pipit

Residents:
Grey Crowned Crane
Grey-Olive Greenbul
Orange-breasted (Zebra) Waxbill

Thanks to Paradise Lost for conserving their environment, and wishing you good birding, 

Fleur
