  <pre>Hi Don,
That is such a good amount of very interesting data. That 50 at Lunga
Lunga is really telling that it a major migrant, we&#39;ll have to see if
Mustafa Adamjee can look around the mangroves there in end of April as
he lives there, or at least see if numbers increase. I can&#39;t imagine
seeing a flock of Mangrove Kingfishers! It&#39;s all falling into that
April-November bracket. Pemba is likely an established resident
population which does not seem to be the case on Zanzibar. If they are
at Dar all year it could be the farthest North that the species
regularly breeds, we really need to see Neil&#39;s TZ Atlas data, because
in Tanzania it may be a breeding bird along the entire southern coast,
and possibly we&#39;ll find that north of Dar all records fall in
April-November just as with us.
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Dear Brian.  The Ngulia bird I think was caught in the early morning (no
&gt; doubt arriving in the night).
&gt;
&gt; Other dated records that we have are:
&gt;
&gt; Historical specimens from Mombasa area Sept-October 1900.
&gt;
&gt; 50+ in mangroves around Vanga (Lunga Lunga) 29 April 1990. Certainly
&gt; suggestive of a movement ( returning north maybe ??)
&gt;
&gt; Malindi August 1984; Sabaki early November 1989.
&gt; My breeding record at Gede was in August.
&gt; Very vocal around Witu and the Kipini conservancy during October 2006,  but
&gt; gone by late November onwards.
&gt;
&gt; Mombasa area:  present June-August. Also a single November record.
&gt;
&gt; There are NO RECORDS from Sunbird Tours to the north Kenya coast during
&gt; January and February which would point to it being absent from the coast
&gt; late November - March /April.
&gt;
&gt; So it seems to be largely present on our coast from April - mid November.
&gt;
&gt; Reportedly resident all year at Dar-es-Salaam and on Pemba, but on Zanzibar
&gt; largely October - February only.
&gt;
&gt; Only a couple of nest records cards that I know of, one of which was is
&gt; unreliable. The other points to an early October breeding (Kenya coast).
&gt;
&gt; Hope this helps.  It certainly points to it being a migrant to our coasts
&gt; April-October.
&gt;
&gt; Best wishes

&gt;&gt; Thanks for this Don,
&gt;&gt; That Ngulia bird was certainly a migrant, can you remember if it was
&gt;&gt; caught at night because it&#39;s likely that&#39;s when they move but if late
&gt;&gt; November it&#39;s getting pretty late. It also begs the question why it
&gt;&gt; would be so off course if it were going south, if coming north it has
&gt;&gt; plenty of space in which to deviate, but going south it can&#39;t have
&gt;&gt; started moving from very far north of Ngulia anyway! Ngulia is 180km
&gt;&gt; from the nearest piece of coast which is strangely equidistant all the
&gt;&gt; way from Kilifi to Mombasa! In Horn of Africa it states it occurs in
&gt;&gt; Somalia north to the Jubba and Shabeelle Rivers where it is &#34;a
&gt;&gt; presumed resident.&#34;
&gt;&gt; Do you know of any completed nest record cards for Kenya?
&gt;&gt; Two interesting kingfishers in succession!
&gt;&gt; Best for now
&gt;&gt; Brian

&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear Brian.  All very interesting.  All I can offer is one year I recall
&gt;&gt;&gt; finding a Mangrove Kingfisher nesting in the hole of a tree in the middle
&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Gede Forest. It was going to the edge of the forest (thick bush) and
&gt;&gt;&gt; taking
&gt;&gt;&gt; food back to the young.  Certainly not crabs !!
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Remember the one ringed at Ngulia on 01 December 2003.  Long way from
&gt;&gt;&gt; any
&gt;&gt;&gt; crabs for sure.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Worth calculating in a straight line how far that was from the nearest
&gt;&gt;&gt; known
&gt;&gt;&gt; locality at the coast.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Best wishes
