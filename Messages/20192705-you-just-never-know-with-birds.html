  <pre>Dear All,
We have a number of house guests at present, going off for a two week
safari this afternoon. I asked them if thy would like to see the birds
in the paddock and we would go up at 7.00am. It was a beautiful
morning, and I was saying how promising it looked, and the birds would
be posing in the trees taking in the sunlight. We stepped out of the
door, with White-browed Sparrow and Baglafecht Weavers. For the next
hour I was saying that the birds will be very active soon once the
insects are flying. I had never been so embarassed before, it was
desolate if anything was moving it was hurtling into thick cover. For
neophyte birders it was enough to make them prefer collecting
beermats! Then I saw a fairly large bird fly through the trees, and
said I thought it might have been a Cuckoo-Hawk and if it is, it is
the first we have had in the garden for over fifteen years. I managed
a couple of images at a distance when it flew into an open
Brachylaena.
This was a very good consolation and we returned for breakfast. This
was interrupted at a later moment when one of the group came with a
photo and asked what is this kingfisher outside showing me a picture
of an adult Grey-headed Kingfisher, only our second ever.
We went out into the paddock and there it was one the tamest I have
encountered. Birds were really active now, and amongst very many
species we had Fish Eagle, Harrier-Hawk, Green-backed Honeybird,
Brown-backed Woodpecker, White-starred Robin, Black-collared Apalis,
Violet-backed Starling, overflying Quailfinch etc.  Never give up!
Best for now
Brian
