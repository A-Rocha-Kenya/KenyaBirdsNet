  <pre>Dear All,

There are three ringing recoveries of Afrotropical kingfishers that I know of affecting East Africa.

Two Grey-headed, both ringed in Ethiopia by the late John Ash; one (ringed 16 Oct 1970, 7°36N) was caught by a ringer at Masogo near Kisumu, Kenya on 19 Nov 1976; the other (ringed 4 Oct 1974, 11°34N) was found dead at Zombo near Mombasa, Kenya on 1 Mar 1975.

A Pied Kingfisher ringed in Ethiopia, 8°N, 21 Jul 1970 was caught at Lake Kyogo, Uganda, in Nov 1971.

Cheers,

Graeme
