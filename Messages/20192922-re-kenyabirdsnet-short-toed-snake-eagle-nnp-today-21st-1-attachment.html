      <p>Dear All,<br>
After 7 weeks of being away and not being able to bird Nairobi<br>
National Park. I was in there today (21st) with Nigel Hunter and Fleur<br>
Ng’Weno. It turned up a very good bird, new for Nairobi and dare I say<br>
also for Finch Pentad!<br>
This is an alert so that those interested can try and see this bird,<br>
(images attached), rather than wait for the full report of<br>
observations.<br>
There are only two records of Short-toed Snake-Eagle in Kenya, this<br>
appears to be a pale adult (below) lacking the white tips to tail and<br>
flight-feathers. It has been multiply shot in the wings, and the<br>
demise of whoever did this whilst it was on migration would make this<br>
world a better place. It’s healthy and no apparent body wounds, it has<br>
an appetite and was on the old burnt area, which is the open ground on<br>
the right, two kilometres from Kingfisher Picnic Site on the way to<br>
the metal bridge across the river valley en route to Maasai Gate.<br>
Best of luck to all who try for it.<br>
Brian<br>
