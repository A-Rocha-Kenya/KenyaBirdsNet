  <pre>Dear Don,
I must confess I did not know that they were racially separated, but
it does look like quite a bit of confusion that someone is
perpetrating, I can accept that if there is a disjunct resident
population in Southern Somalia it could very well be a separate form
from the wintering birds, but to give a separate name to a bird from
Pangani in Tz all through coastal Kenya to Somalia which is a migrant
from somewhere else, rather suggests that the taxon is coming from
further south in S Tz and Mozambique, and we don&#39;t see nominate at all
as they migrate between KZN and Eastern Cape, or it&#39;s a monotype in
two or possibly three populations, I really think what you have told
me cannot happen. If there are distinctions in the races, I cannot
imagine that no-one took images of the bird netted at Boni, would we
be able to determine race from an image?
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Dear Brian. There are TWO POPULATIONS: Nominate birds are strictly Southern
&gt; African, white our birds are ranivorus (Type locality Pangani).
&gt; Whether ranivorus is worthy of separate subspecific status is debatable
&gt; however.
&gt;
&gt; One thought being that nominate birds extends up to Dar-es-Salaam, Zanzibar
&gt; and Pemba, with ranivorus from the Pangani River north to Somalia.
&gt;
&gt; All depends on who you want to follow.

&gt;&gt; Hi Nate,
&gt;&gt; You have been impressively busy, this is such a good haul of data,
&gt;&gt; thanks so much for all this input.
&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t know exactly how to drive eBird, so did not get to the
&gt;&gt; individual records themselves, but I did get into the images. For the
&gt;&gt; East African records they all fell into the March-November period
&gt;&gt; except, a bird on Mafia which could have a resident population like
&gt;&gt; Pemba.
&gt;&gt; When Don had his breeding record it was August which is when Mangrove
&gt;&gt; K&#39;s are in Kenya. On your detailed sighting list, the only record
&gt;&gt; outside of it was Doris&#39;s Tana records on 3rd and 4th Feb 2017, which
&gt;&gt; is interesting.
&gt;&gt; What I do find very intriguing is that when our birds are present, is
&gt;&gt; exactly the time they winter in KZN where they do not breed, which
&gt;&gt; certainly supports there being two different populations. When our
&gt;&gt; birds go south, so do the KZN birds to breed in the Eastern Cape. It&#39;s
&gt;&gt; dangerous to suppose anything in birds nowadays, but it would suggest
&gt;&gt; that our birds do not go as far south as Natal and are southern
&gt;&gt; Tanzanian and Mozambican birds.
&gt;&gt; Best for now
&gt;&gt; Brian
