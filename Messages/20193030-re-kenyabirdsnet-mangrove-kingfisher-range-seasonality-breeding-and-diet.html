  <pre>Thanks so much Doris,
It really does help a lot, and reinforces what Mustafa supplied this
morning, showing that it is predominately (and maybe entirely) a
winter migrant from the south,
Very best and hope your wader spots are filling up nicely,
Brian

&gt; Hi Brian,
&gt;
&gt; All I can add is that I have been recording the Mangrove Kingfisher during
&gt; the last few years from the month of April to November mostly at my birding
&gt; hotspot, which is Nguuni Nature Sanctuary North of Mombasa!! As per my
&gt; observations it is not breeding in the area!!
&gt;
&gt; Hope this helps!!
&gt;
&gt; Greetings

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Dear All,
&gt;&gt; A friend and well-known author in South Africa Hugh Chittenden, has
&gt;&gt; asked me about the diets at the nest site and away from the nest of
&gt;&gt; Mangrove Kingfisher in the East African region. I told him that living
&gt;&gt; a long way from the coast I had little intimate experience with the
&gt;&gt; species. But I would put his queries on the net, advising that we have
&gt;&gt; very many dedicated birders living along the coast, and they would
&gt;&gt; surely be able to assist with some details.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; What he found is that Mozambique birds feed on crabs almost
&gt;&gt; exclusively in the winter, but move inland to breed in wooded areas
&gt;&gt; and then live on a crab-free diet and feed this to their young.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In KZNatal the birds are present only as non-breeding wintering birds
&gt;&gt; and feed almost exclusively on crabs, then migrate south in summer to
&gt;&gt; breed on the Eastern Cape when they appear to feed on invertebrates
&gt;&gt; and not crabs, and crabs seem not to be in the diet that they feed
&gt;&gt; their young.
&gt;&gt; Hugh was asking the question, is there an important reason for this
&gt;&gt; change of diet seasonally. (See attachment).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; He was asking what they feed their young on at the nest in East
&gt;&gt; Africa, and the diet when non-breeding. Personally I have only thought
&gt;&gt; of Mangrove Kingfisher as a migrant from further south rather than a
&gt;&gt; breeding bird, but they do seem to call territorially.
&gt;&gt; They are a breeding resident on Pemba Island, but only seasonal to
&gt;&gt; Zanzibar, and there must be some information from these two islands.
&gt;&gt; The local literature does not suggest that it is a migrant in EAf, in
&gt;&gt; fact it states that it is a resident along the entire seaboard.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; They do wander, and I have only ever seen one bird that was obviously
&gt;&gt; lost and that was in Tanzania on the Pangani River west of the
&gt;&gt; Usambaras (where the Black-bellied Sunbirds breed).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So it would appear that Hugh has a very interesting subject that he is
&gt;&gt; studying and it would be great to help him out with all the
&gt;&gt; information from EAf that we can provide. From reading what is said
&gt;&gt; about our birds, we still have much to learn too, as I think that to
&gt;&gt; call it just a breeding resident is oversimplification.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This is what Hugh wrote, and there is an attachment…
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; “Hi Brian,
&gt;&gt; …I&#39;d like to request info from you regarding Mangrove Kingfishers.. I
&gt;&gt; have been monitoring this species of late. They are winter visitors
&gt;&gt; here (Mtunzini, just south of Richards Bay). I&#39;ll forward recent
&gt;&gt; correspondence and photos in a separate email.
&gt;&gt; The two different populations in southern Africa have different
&gt;&gt; breeding strategies. The South African population migrates south to
&gt;&gt; the eastern Cape estuaries to breed, then returns to n KwaZulu-Natal
&gt;&gt; region for winter. The Mozambique birds act differently. They simply
&gt;&gt; move inland and breed in termitaria they find in lowland
&gt;&gt; forest/woodland during the breeding season. No suitable termitaria in
&gt;&gt; South Africa.
&gt;&gt; So, the southern African birds essentially have a summer and a winter
&gt;&gt; diet. The winter diet is predominantly crabs (mangrove habitat), and
&gt;&gt; summer a mix, with few, if any crabs I should think. There is little
&gt;&gt; published data on food delivered to nests.
&gt;&gt; I have been trying to understand these feeding regimes because it
&gt;&gt; interests me why Mangrove Kingfishers in SA migrate south to breed
&gt;&gt; when there are Barbet and Woodpecker holes available to them here in
&gt;&gt; KZN??
&gt;&gt; I&#39;d be interested in what your birds feed on summer, versus winter?
&gt;&gt; Regards
&gt;&gt; Hugh

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It would be interesting to copy your email to kenyabirdsnet, so we can
&gt;&gt; all see the interesting facts emerging,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Best to all
&gt;&gt; Brian
