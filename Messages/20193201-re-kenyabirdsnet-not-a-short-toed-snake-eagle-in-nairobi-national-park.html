      <p>Dear All,<br>
Dick Forsman has very kindly come back to me concerning the record I<br>
posted on kenyabirdsnet of a Short-toed Snake-Eagle in NNP last<br>
October. It mentions the features that supports the identity of a<br>
young Black-chested Snake-Eagle rather than what I had misidentified<br>
it as. This has been most useful, though the features necessitate<br>
close contact with the bird, but I thought I would share them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi Brian,<br>
<br>
Sorry for long wait, but I have been abroad for some time.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the interesting images. However, to me this bird is not a<br>
Short-toed (STSE), but a light form juvenile of Black-breasted<br>
Snake-eagle (BBSE).<br>
<br>
Superficially it looks like a STSE, but the barring of the underwing,<br>
with a few distinct bands close together but quite far out on the<br>
feather, does not match that species. Also the upperwing lacks the<br>
sharp contrast between light coverts and dark remiges typical of STSE.<br>
This is a juvenile bird, as shown for instance by its uniform<br>
upperwing secondaries, and juv STSE would be perfectly fresh in<br>
pristine plumage at this time of year, while this one is extremely<br>
worn.<br>
<br>
I remember having once seen a very similar pale (but fresh) juvenile<br>
in Ethiopia, so I guess these pale ones must be quite rare.<br>
<br>
all the very best,<br>
<br>
Dick&quot;<br>
<br>
The points that separate this bird from a STSE are very fine and good<br>
views must be available, thankfully for our bird the views were<br>
nothing short of exceptional, but this bleached extensively pale young<br>
form of Black-chested Snake-Eagle is not mentioned in the local<br>
literature and it is a major pitfall for the unwary, as it was for us.<br>
For example S&amp;F ...Imm is brown above and mainly rufous below with<br>
rufous underwing-coverts and indistinctly barred flight feathers.<br>
Z&amp;T... is more helpful in stating ...Transitional immature may show<br>
whitish face and throat (although dark faced/white crowned in NNP<br>
bird), dark breast band, and blotching on white underparts similar to<br>
Short-toed Snake Eagle (unfortunately this is not illustrated). Leslie<br>
Brown in Handbook BOA writes..... Immature dark brown above, rufous or<br>
cinnamon below, sub-adult plumage obscure, but some probably almost<br>
indistinguishable from {nominate} gallicus {Short-toed}. Again only<br>
typical bird illustrated. Sasol Birds of Prey, Kemp illustrates and<br>
describes typical rusty immature, and for sub-adult writes....<br>
Distinct subadult plumage similar to adult plumage but sooty-brown<br>
above. Below white or cream, marked with large brown blobs on upper<br>
chest and broad rufous-brown bars on flanks and flight-feathers.<br>
None of all this comes close to the NNP bird.<br>
<br>
It would be great if the Raptorphiles out there who are familiar with<br>
the characters that will separate this pale young plumage BCSE from<br>
similar pale STSE would put pen to paper and share the knowledge as<br>
this is an omission in what literature is currently available.<br>
<br>
Best to all<br>
Brian<br>
