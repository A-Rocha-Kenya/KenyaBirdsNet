  <pre>Hi Marco,
An interesting bird. For two years (ten years ago) we had one that was
nearly all white that was accepted by our small resident Superb
Starling flock here on Mukoma, sadly I never managed an image as I
only saw it from a vehicle and always in flight, and even then never
had a camera!
Best for now
Brian
