  <pre>Hi Sidney,
Thanks so much for this superb acount. I was stunned by the gathering
of hornbills for  handouts!
Can you see if you have any other images of the Purple-banded Sunbird,
as although I cannot see the underparts clearly, I think this should
be a Tsavo Sunbird although it could be the most westerly recorded,
PBS is restricted to extreme SW Kenya and even more extreme
restriction along the coastal belt.
Best for now
Brian
