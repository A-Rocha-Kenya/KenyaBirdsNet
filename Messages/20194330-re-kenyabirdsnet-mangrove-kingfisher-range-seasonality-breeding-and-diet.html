      <p>Dear Brian.  The Ngulia bird I think was caught in the early morning (no doubt arriving in the night). <br>
<br>
Other dated records that we have are:<br>
<br>
Historical specimens from Mombasa area Sept-October 1900.<br>
<br>
50+ in mangroves around Vanga (Lunga Lunga) 29 April 1990. Certainly suggestive of a movement ( returning north maybe ??)<br>
<br>
Malindi August 1984; Sabaki early November 1989.<br>
My breeding record at Gede was in August.<br>
Very vocal around Witu and the Kipini conservancy during October 2006,  but gone by late November onwards.<br>
<br>
Mombasa area:  present June-August. Also a single November record.<br>
<br>
There are NO RECORDS from Sunbird Tours to the north Kenya coast during January and February which would point to it being absent from the coast late November - March /April.<br>
<br>
So it seems to be largely present on our coast from April - mid November.<br>
<br>
Reportedly resident all year at Dar-es-Salaam and on Pemba, but on Zanzibar largely October - February only.<br>
<br>
Only a couple of nest records cards that I know of, one of which was is unreliable. The other points to an early October breeding (Kenya coast).<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.  It certainly points to it being a migrant to our coasts April-October.<br>
<br>
Best wishes<br>
Don<br>

&gt; Thanks for this Don,<br>
&gt; That Ngulia bird was certainly a migrant, can you remember if it was<br>
&gt; caught at night because it&#39;s likely that&#39;s when they move but if late<br>
&gt; November it&#39;s getting pretty late. It also begs the question why it<br>
&gt; would be so off course if it were going south, if coming north it has<br>
&gt; plenty of space in which to deviate, but going south it can&#39;t have<br>
&gt; started moving from very far north of Ngulia anyway! Ngulia is 180km<br>
&gt; from the nearest piece of coast which is strangely equidistant all the<br>
&gt; way from Kilifi to Mombasa! In Horn of Africa it states it occurs in<br>
&gt; Somalia north to the Jubba and Shabeelle Rivers where it is &quot;a<br>
&gt; presumed resident.&quot;<br>
&gt; Do you know of any completed nest record cards for Kenya?<br>
&gt; Two interesting kingfishers in succession!<br>
&gt; Best for now<br>
&gt; Brian<br>

&gt;&gt; Dear Brian.  All very interesting.  All I can offer is one year I recall<br>
&gt;&gt; finding a Mangrove Kingfisher nesting in the hole of a tree in the middle of<br>
&gt;&gt; Gede Forest. It was going to the edge of the forest (thick bush) and taking<br>
&gt;&gt; food back to the young.  Certainly not crabs !!<br>
&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt; Remember the one ringed at Ngulia on 01 December 2003.  Long way from any<br>
&gt;&gt; crabs for sure.<br>
&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt; Worth calculating in a straight line how far that was from the nearest known<br>
&gt;&gt; locality at the coast.<br>
&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt; Best wishes<br>
