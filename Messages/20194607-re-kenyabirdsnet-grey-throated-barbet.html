        <div>Hi everyone,</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div>After re-reading my latest message, I would like to
          apologize for a more "preaching" tone than I intended.  I was
          intending to start by describing systems I am familiar with as
          a reference, and then ask follow-up questions to learn about
          the state of things in E. Africa and Africa as a whole.  </div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div>But without intending it, some of my email came perilously
          close to sounding like lecturing and for that I apologize.   </div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div>As Brian said: Africa and her birdlife is so huge that a
          single African ornithological authority is impractical.   I
          suppose  in the back of my mind I might have been wondering if
          there might be regional authorities, perhaps in some places
          but not others.  </div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div>And I would like to add my voice to those thanking Michael
          for spending the time to give us his well-written explanation
          of the use of the Tobias et al scoring system and its use in
          generating the BirdLife List.  I look forward to digesting the
          publication.   I might not agree with all of it, but such an
          attempt to describe a system to bring more order to the state
          of things seems a worthy goal.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div>Good birding,</div>
        <div><br>

        <div>Nate</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div>PS</div>
        <div>Goodness knows, the systems I described have their flaws. 
          For example:  sometimes glacial decisions or course
          corrections in the face of valid evidence, sometimes rapid
          ones based on currently "sexy" evidence.  <br>

                                group has felt like a slowly stagnating
                                pool, getting ever smaller and less
                                interesting, with Brian's extensive NNP
                                contributions and Fleur's
                                record-breaking walk updates the only
                                regular pulses keeping it alive. As
                                Fleur alludes in her email, the future
                                of this group - and so much more -
                                depends on the contributions of Sidney,
                                Washington and all the up-and-coming
                                Kenyan birders, but where are the

                                your voices are missing here. This
                                shouldn't just be a conversation for

                              <div><b>Michael, Brian, Nate and Don</b> -
                                thank you so much for your contributions
                                and insight here, all of which have
                                helped me understand more about the
                                position of Birdlife/ HBW. I think the
                                discussion so far has been helpful in
                                concluding that this is still very much
                                a work in progress. One of the most
                                valuable insights, for me, is that many
                                of these 'new species' are in fact 'old
                                species' that have already been
                                described, only to be lumped and now
                                reinstated to species level. This in
                                itself raises several new questions;</div>
                              <div><br>
                              </div>
                              <div>1. Does 'reinstating' remove the need
                                for a new paper or study entirely, or
                                does work still need to be done? </div>
                              <div>2. The scientific name of such a
                                'new-old species' is recorded in history
                                and, therefore, has precedence over any
                                new name but what happens if that name
                                is already in use? </div>
                              <div>3. Where a form has been formally
                                described previously, such as Ruvu
                                Weaver <i>Ploceus holoxanthus</i>, is
                                it fair game to be treated as a species
                                within a new field guide (e.g. that of
                                Brian and I) even if it is not yet
                                treated as such by Birdlife/ HBW? We'll
                                be treating it as a species regardless
                                but it is good to get an idea of the
                                issues that this creates.</div>

                                be greatly appreciated.</div>

                                the Birdlife/ HBW team are not solely
                                about splitting for the sake of
                                splitting. In some cases, they have been
                                quite reluctant to do so, such as in the
                                case of Willard's Sooty Boubou, a
                                newly-described form from the Albertine
                                Rift, that Birdlife/ HBW have lumped
                                with Mountain Sooty Boubou from West
                                Africa (This is not to be confused with
                                Mountain Black Boubou [as we know it
                                from Stevenson &amp; Fanshawe] which has
                                been renamed as Albertine Sooty Boubou).</div>

                        investigators must have been placed in the
                        public domain, but there<br>
                        are no such references for many of the “new
                        species.”  I feel that<br>
                        this shortsightedness leads to much of the doubt
                        cast on the validity<br>
                        of some of their work. This all relates to the
                        necessity of having<br>
                        stringent guidelines to formalising the
                        announcement of a new species.<br>
                        By breaking away from tradition (not always a
                        bad thing), it seemed<br>
                        retrogressive rather than progressive, as we had
                        drifted away from<br>
                        what we call the “species concept” which is an
                        intangible anyway, and<br>
                        through the new principals entered an even
                        greyer area. That saying we<br>
                        have entered into the era of “shocking
                        revelation” where outrageous<br>
                        disarrangements of our way of thinking about the
                        taxonomic<br>
                        classifications don’t in fact shock us anymore!<br>
                        <br>
                        I think most of us appreciate that the
                        production of the checklist was<br>
                        intended as a work in progress and not as a fait
                        accompli, but I<br>
                        cannot help but feel that the forms being
                        elevated to species level,<br>
                        would not have been better served as “probable
                        species following<br>
                        further study” rather than jumping in with a new
                        system that had no<br>
                        genetic backing, and expecting the world to
                        unite and follow it. Had<br>
                        the suggestions of the new taxa not been set in
                        stone with a probably<br>
                        misinterpreted arrogance by the birding public
                        at large, then in all<br>
                        possibility it might have ignited people to
                        become involved to prove<br>
                        that the Tobias concept did in fact prevail. I
                        am a morphologist<br>
                        first, and believe that genetic analysis
                        partners to give a near<br>
                        complete story, but not the morphology standing
                        alone, nor the<br>
                        laboratory work standing alone either.<br>
                        <br>
                        I fully understand what you are saying about how
                        taxonomy has evolved,<br>
                        initially everything was described as a species,
                        then before there was<br>
                        anything more than morphological data available
                        many forms got lumped<br>
                        together as belonging to the same species, it is
                        just in the last few<br>
                        decades that we (at least in East Africa) have
                        been re-examining the<br>
                        forms and through genetic markers have found
                        that they represent novel<br>
                        species after all and are reinstating the
                        original stand alone species<br>
                        status, and in this regard there is still much
                        to come. But what I<br>
                        think we are realising that the most convincing
                        results are<br>
                        morphological/genetic analyses. I can’t agree
                        with any genetic<br>
                        information being excluded so that it levels the
                        playing field for all<br>
                        birds for that same reason, and believe that if
                        there was such<br>
                        existing genetic data it should have been
                        integral to the result. It’s<br>
                        a bit like acknowledging if we do it this way we
                        will get one set of<br>
                        results but if we do it the other we might get a
                        different set of<br>
                        results, so for me the only really level playing
                        field is the<br>
                        combination of the two methodologies.<br>
                        <br>
                        I want to see BirdLife triumph in uniting the
                        various factions towards<br>
                        a unified agreement regarding the bird species
                        on the planet, but I<br>
                        don’t think this will be possible until genetic
                        assessment comes into<br>
                        the equation, so that the propositions are more
                        solid and convincing.<br>
                        <br>
                        Nate,<br>
                        Here in Africa we have regions with regards to
                        which authority we<br>
                        follow, East Africa and Horn of Africa is
                        unified, Southern Africa is<br>
                        unified, and West Africa is unified but Africa
                        isn’t completely, and<br>
                        it would be true to say that there is no
                        overseeing body that is<br>
                        actively uniting the continent. There has been
                        much progress with<br>
                        acceptance of both Common and Scientific names
                        and we are fairly much<br>
                        all speaking the same language ornithologically.
                        However each country<br>
                        is autonomous when it comes to the preparation
                        of its country<br>
                        Checklist, and there lies the problem regarding
                        which authority to<br>
                        follow.<br>
                        As a country Kenya is very supportive of
                        BirdLife, and just how much<br>
                        it helps us to protect our birds and habitat,
                        but when it comes to the<br>
                        BirdLife list the tendency is not to accept
                        these changes at species<br>
                        level without seeing a peer reviewed paper
                        first. I have no idea how<br>
                        the different countries on the continent are
                        variously facing the same<br>
                        situation, perhaps Michael has some inkling
                        here.<br>
                        What you must remember is that Africa is a vast
                        region and very much<br>
                        unlike Europe and North America, and with maybe
                        the exception of RSA<br>
                        there are not more than a few Professional
                        Ornithologists in any of<br>
                        the remaining countries, and to get groups of
                        Professional<br>
                        Ornithogists to come together as a committee to
                        sort out taxonomic<br>
                        issues usually has to involve outside
                        assistance.<br>
                        <br>
                        Don,<br>
                        I agree with all you stated,<br>
                        <br>
                        Best for now<br>
