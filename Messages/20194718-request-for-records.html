  <div dir="ltr">Dear birders,<br><br>Over the years since the Kenya Bird Map project began, it has become apparent that some people do not like the data collection protocol as it does not match how they like to do their birding. E.g. a Full Protocol requires that you record birds in the order that you see and hear them so that the ranking of species on your list can be used in analyses to assess relative abundance among other things, but some people do not like recording lists while out in the field and prefer to tick through a taxonomically-arranged checklist at the end of the day. Some prefer to use the eBird app rather than the app that the KBM uses (BirdLasser). eBird does not record birds in the order they are seen and does not record them in pentads (grid squares used on the KBM). And some do not like using smartphones at all.<br><br>This has led to several very keen and expert birders simply not submitting their bird records to the Kenya Bird Map. This represents a loss of many useful records for the atlas. Many of the rarer birds, e.g. several flufftails and crakes, have very few records on the KBM at present and some have no records at all. <div><br></div><div>I&#39;m writing this as a request for anyone who keeps bird lists/records from anywhere in Kenya to send their lists to the KBM. If you have not followed the proper data collection protocol, your records will simply go into the database as ad-hoc records. Although the analysis that can be done on such records is limited, as compared to full protocol records, they still contribute to building the basic distribution maps (presence/absence data) for our birds. All you need is to indicate the date and location (as precisely as possible, GPS coordinates preferred) so that your records can be assigned to the right pentads. Single records of interesting/rare/unusual birds are also welcome. If you have lists on eBird, you can also send them. Simply send your records to <a href="mailto:kenyabirdmap@naturekenya.org">kenyabirdmap@naturekenya.org</a>. For those who are already submitting full protocol lists, thank you very much and please keep it up! With enough records from across the country, the Kenya Bird Map has the potential to play a very important role in assessing the current conservation status of our birds and developing a national red list. I urge you to be a part of it.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br clear="all"><div><div dir="ltr" class="gmail_signature" data-smartmail="gmail_signature"><div dir="ltr"><div><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><b>Sidney Shema<br></b><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Project Manager - <a href="http://kenyabirdmap.adu.org.za/index.php" target="_blank">Kenya Bird Map</a></b><br></div><div><b style="font-size:12.8px">Website and Blog: <a href="http://www.shotsbyshema.com/" target="_blank">www.shotsbyshema.com</a></b></div><div><b style="font-size:12.8px">Photography Prints: <a href="https://teespring.com/stores/shotsbyshema" target="_blank">ShotsByShema Untamed Photography store</a></b><a href="https://teespring.com/stores/shotsbyshema" target="_blank"><br></a></div><div><b>Social Media: </b><b style="font-size:12.8px">Facebook - <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ShotsByShema/" target="_blank">Shots By Shema - Untamed Photography</a>; </b><b style="font-size:12.8px">Instagram - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shotsbyshema/" target="_blank">@ShotsByShema</a></b></div><div><b>Mobile: +254 738290842</b></div><div><br></div><div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><b style="font-size:12.8px"><span style="font-size:12.8px">Join the </span><a href="http://kenyabirdmap.adu.org.za/" target="_blank">Kenya Bird Map project</a> and contribute directly to bird conservation through citizen science!<br></b></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
