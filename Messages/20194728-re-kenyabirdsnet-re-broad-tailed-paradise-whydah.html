  <pre>Hi Sidney,
100% Broad-tailed Paradise Whydah and such superb images, a great
Atlas triumph and certainly if resident Orange-winged Pytilia must
certainly be there.
Where exactly was the bird, and was it alone?
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Thank you Don. An exciting record indeed. A first of this species for the
&gt; atlas. And possibly an indication of orange-winged pytilia presence in
&gt; Tharaka-Nithi too?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Sidney

&gt;&gt; Dear Sidney.  This DOES very much look like a Broad-tailed Paradise
&gt;&gt; Whydah.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The current status of this very rare bird can best be summed up as
&gt;&gt; follows:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &#34;Formerly resident in the Embu and Meru districts, but specimen and any
&gt;&gt; photographic evidence has been lacking since 1945-47. Meanwhile sight
&gt;&gt; records near Embu and Sagana in 2003 and at Sabuk, Laikipia in September
&gt;&gt; 2011 do suggest a continued presence in the country‚Äù.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; A great photograph indeed.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Best wishes
&gt;&gt; Don Turner
&gt;&gt;
