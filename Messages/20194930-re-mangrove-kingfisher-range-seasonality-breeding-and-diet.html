&gt; Thanks Brian.   Every now and then, a Mouse can help a Lion.
&gt; 
&gt; If people would like to drill down on December-February records only,
&gt; this web link will pull that up:

&gt; Again, it helps to click the &#34;Show Points Sooner&#34; box on the right
&gt; side of the page to make the individual site markers more distinct as
&gt; you zoom in.
&gt; 
&gt; There are a finite number of eBird reports from December-February in
&gt; Kenya - they are listed below (except the Ngulia record which has
&gt; already been mentioned)
&gt; 
&gt; Working north to south:
&gt; 
&gt; January 8, 1987 - Eric VanderWerf had one just west of the Sabaki
&gt; River Mouth near the Malinidi-Garsen Road bridge.
&gt; https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S39346452
&gt; 
&gt; February 17, 2019 - Ri Nique had one at &#39;Bofa-Kilifi&#39;.
&gt; https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S53498370
&gt; 
&gt; December 7, 2016 - Doris Schaule had one at the Nguuni Nature
&gt; Sanctuary just north of Mombasa.
&gt; https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S32918532
&gt; 
&gt; January 10, 2015 - Laurent Esselen had one just east of Haller Park
&gt; outside Mombasa.   https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S21277789
&gt; 
&gt; January 8 2015 - Andrew Rains reported two south of Diani Beach.
&gt; https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S21248793
&gt; 
&gt; February 19, 2018 - Stephanie Dolrenry had one just east of Mwabungu.
&gt; https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S43419719
&gt; 
&gt; January 10, 2016 - Simon Carter had two at the Gazi mangrove
&gt; boardwalk.   Notes say &#34;Calling to each other. Recording Id&#39;d by James
&gt; Bradley.&#34;  https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S26813864
&gt; 
&gt; February 4, 2017 - Rob Williams had one in Shimoni at the &#39;Deep Sea
&gt; Adventures&#34; garden.   https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S34172736
&gt; 
&gt; February 14, 1995 - four were reported around Vanga to the Kenya
&gt; Birdfinder project from a National Museum of Kenya Ornithology
&gt; Department waterbird count.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The bulk of them seem to be in the past four years - perhaps this is
&gt; an artifact of eBird not existing until recently.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Good birding,
&gt;

&gt;&gt; Hi Nate,
&gt;&gt; You have been impressively busy, this is such a good haul of data,
&gt;&gt; thanks so much for all this input.
&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t know exactly how to drive eBird, so did not get to the
&gt;&gt; individual records themselves, but I did get into the images. For the
&gt;&gt; East African records they all fell into the March-November period
&gt;&gt; except, a bird on Mafia which could have a resident population like
&gt;&gt; Pemba.
&gt;&gt; When Don had his breeding record it was August which is when Mangrove
&gt;&gt; K&#39;s are in Kenya. On your detailed sighting list, the only record
&gt;&gt; outside of it was Doris&#39;s Tana records on 3rd and 4th Feb 2017, which
&gt;&gt; is interesting.
&gt;&gt; What I do find very intriguing is that when our birds are present, is
&gt;&gt; exactly the time they winter in KZN where they do not breed, which
&gt;&gt; certainly supports there being two different populations. When our
&gt;&gt; birds go south, so do the KZN birds to breed in the Eastern Cape. It&#39;s
&gt;&gt; dangerous to suppose anything in birds nowadays, but it would suggest
&gt;&gt; that our birds do not go as far south as Natal and are southern
&gt;&gt; Tanzanian and Mozambican birds.
&gt;&gt; Best for now
&gt;&gt; Brian
