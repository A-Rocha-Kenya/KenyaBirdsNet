    <p>The tern colony on Whale Island is fully active this year.
      Initially in late June we had only a handful Roseates and fewer
      still Sooty Terns but now numbers have increased to a cloud of
      birds above the island most of the day. Once again, as per last
      year, we had Lesser Noddies on and around the island - this time
      we estimated c.200 birds (last year if I remember right it was
      c.60). We looked hard for Brown Noddy and eventually counted 13
      birds. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Today a very nice surprise found on the A Rocha centre's nature
      trail at plot 28 by Apolloh, an intern from KWSTI, was our second
      Eastern Bronze-naped Pigeon. The first was ringed on 4 Sept 2009
      and we've not had any since then. It would appear that a small
      population still head to the coastal forest / thickets in
      August/September.<br>

    <p>The first few returning migrant waders have arrived - especially
      Common Sandpipers which are now fully present in small numbers. We
      also have finally discovered and confirmed a beach to the south of
      the mouth of Mida Creek where we believe all the large waders go
      to roost from Mida at high tide - notably the Crab-plovers. We
      will be doing further counts and surveys to double confirm this
      and assess the status of the beach as a long-term roost site. In
      season we have 2,000-3,000 smaller waders on the main Watamu
      beach, but the larger ones never use this beach during the day (at
      night you can sometimes find them, but again not in large
      numbers). <br>
    </p>
    <p>On a non-ornithological note, in the A Rocha Dakatcha Nature
      Reserve (which A Rocha Kenya is creating to protect specifically
      the Sokoke Scops Owl and Golden-rumped Sengi) we have recently
      photographed with camera traps not only the first images of the <a

href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2001336926/scientists-confirm-presence-of-rare-elephant-shrew-in-kilifi">sengi</a>
      but also Caracal, Blotched Genet, Red Duiker and Bushbuck - which
      is encouraging given the level of snaring that has been happening
      in the Dakatcha Woodlands KBA. To date the reserve is 830 acres in
      size and we are negotiating on a further 150 acres. Birdwise other
      than the owl, the most notable record for the reserve has possibly
      been the Sokoke Pipit (seen regularly) and Little Yellow
      Flycatcher - which I've not recorded elsewhere in Dakatcha (though
      Fleur, with her more widely ranging surveys in recent times may
      well have encountered?!). We've not recorded Clarke's Weaver there
      - but this is not surprising since there is only a tiny patch of
      Brachystegia present. NatureKenya are securing a good area of this
      habitat and wetlands for breeding sites for the weaver 40+ kms to
      the north of where we're working. <br>
