Under tail of some may show some white.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">Has anyone seen this dark morph during the period November - February ?? ( allowing for stragglers to occur in April and October).</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">All this beggars the question: &nbsp;If all known records fall between March-September, then odds are that IT IS a dark Jacobin Cuckoo, but if there are some November-February records then odds point to a resident form of Levaillant's, which in itself would be unusual as Levaillvant's is strictly a “rains” migrant throughout, and November-February is a largely hot dry period at the coast.&nbsp;</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">If, as most books say, it is a dark morph of Levaillant’s Cuckoo, why is this dark morph NOT seen anywhere else in East Africa or even anywhere in the rest of Africa; or is there a dark morph elsewhere ????.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">Dark <i class="">serratus</i> of Jacobin Cuckoo are largely coastal in South Africa with 50% of all birds in Natal this variety. It would make sense for this form to migrate north along the eastern seaboard of Africa during the April - September period, then back to Natal. &nbsp;So any November-February records become all the more important.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">Thoughts and records welcomed, also any dated photographs.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">Best wishes</div><div class="">Don Turner</div></div></div></body></html>
