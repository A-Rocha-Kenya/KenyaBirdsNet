  <pre>Hi Fleur,
What you have here is an Abdim&#39;s with a white tail, but I cannot say I
have ever heard of anything like this before,
best for now

&gt; Greetings birders
&gt;
&gt; On the crane count March 7 near the KALRO Practical Training Centre near
&gt; Thika, our team saw a stork circling overhead. Black Stork or Abdim’s? Soon
&gt; they were four storks, all circling, but we kept changing our minds on the
&gt; ID. The photos below by Paul Wachira show why.
&gt;
&gt; One stork is obviously a Black Stork with a long red beak. I saw the long
&gt; red beak clearly as flew down to land some distance away.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The other is an Abdim’s Stork – but the entire tail is white, not just the
&gt; rump. The other two storks were not photographed.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Any comments?
&gt;
&gt; Wishing you good birding, Fleur
&gt;
