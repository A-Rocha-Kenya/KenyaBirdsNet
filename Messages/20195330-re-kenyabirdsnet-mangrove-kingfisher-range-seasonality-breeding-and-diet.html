  <pre>Hi Fleur,
Thanks for this, we are all learning something. Although your records
fall into the normal window for the species, Boni-Dodori might even
have a separate population as is suggested for southern Somalia, or
both the Kingfisher and the Robin-Chats were all southerners  and left
shortly after you did!
Best for now
Brian

&gt; Coming into this discussion a bit lateâ€¦.
&gt;
&gt; Museum researchers and ringers caught a Mangrove Kingfisher in early
&gt; November 2013 near Mangai in the Boni-Dodori area. What a bird to see up
&gt; close! The same ringing session caught a netful of Red-capped Robin Chats.
&gt; Mangrove Kingfishers were also recorded in riparian forest in the
&gt; Boni-Dodori area in the first half of April 2014.
&gt;
&gt; Mangrove Kingfishers are often seen in Dakatcha Woodland, a good distance
&gt; from the sea. (There are fresh-water crabs, but only obvious in the rainy
&gt; season.) I did not realize these kingfishers were migrants from the south
&gt; and wondered why sometimes we do not see them in Dakatcha forests. Now I
&gt; understand.
&gt;
&gt; Good birding to all, Fleur

&gt;&gt; Fascinating conversation everyone.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I did a species search for Mangrove Kingfisher records in eBird and zoomed
&gt;&gt; in to look at Kenya reports.   There are many reports (some with photos)
&gt;&gt; besides those mentioned thus far.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; To view them, visit this web link to a Mangrove Kingfisher search on eBird
&gt;&gt; - check the &#34;Show Points Sooner&#34; box on the right of the screen to display
&gt;&gt; better:
&gt;&gt; https://ebird.org/map/mankin2?neg=true&amp;env.minX=&amp;env.minY=&amp;env.maxX=&amp;env.maxY=&amp;zh=false&amp;gp=false&amp;ev=Z&amp;mr=1-12&amp;bmo=1&amp;emo=12&amp;yr=all&amp;byr=1900&amp;eyr=2019
&gt;&gt; &lt;https://ebird.org/map/mankin2?neg=true&amp;env.minX=&amp;env.minY=&amp;env.maxX=&amp;env.maxY=&amp;zh=false&amp;gp=false&amp;ev=Z&amp;mr=1-12&amp;bmo=1&amp;emo=12&amp;yr=all&amp;byr=1900&amp;eyr=2019&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; One can alter the search for specific months by clicking the &#34;Date&#34;
&gt;&gt; pull-down in the menu near the top of the page.   For what it&#39;s worth,
&gt;&gt; changing the search to only the months from March-April still yields quite
&gt;&gt; a few results in coastal Kenya.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Since Don&#39;s breeding record at Gede was in August, I looked for eBird
&gt;&gt; reports from late July-September.    There are quite a few:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Sunday August 10, 2008 Brad Bergstrom photographed a Mangrove Kingfisher
&gt;&gt; on the Lower Tana River Delta between Anasa and Kibokoni:

&gt;&gt; &lt;https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S37155792&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Other eBird reports of Mangrove Kingfishers at the Lower Tana River Delta
&gt;&gt; Hotspot are:
&gt;&gt; February 3rd and 4th 2017 - Doris Schaule
&gt;&gt; April 9th 2019 - Mustafa Amanjee
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Tuesday September 20, 2011 Fiona Reid observed a Mangrove Kingfisher at
&gt;&gt; Che Shale (Kenya Birdfinder historical record entered into eBird).

&gt;&gt; &lt;https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S39111039&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; There are several eBird checklists reporting this species from the Sabaki
&gt;&gt; River mouth, including:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; August 15, 1989 - David Holyoak.  Notes say &#34;S. shore of estuary&#34;

&gt;&gt; &lt;https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S49966029&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Friday, September 12 Jesse Ham observed a Mangrove Kingfisher at Lake Chem
&gt;&gt; Chem west of Malindi.  (Kenya Birdfinder historical record entered into
&gt;&gt; eBird)   https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S39110990
&gt;&gt; &lt;https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S39110990&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Monday September 7, 2009 Doug Macaulay observed one at Lake Jilore&#39;s north
&gt;&gt; edge
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Monday September 7, 2009 Doug Macaulay also observed one in the northern
&gt;&gt; Arabuko-Sokoke Forest.  Mouth-watering checklist with Mangrove Kingfisher

&gt;&gt; &lt;https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S7299010&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; There are multiple other eBird reports of Mangrove Kingfisher in
&gt;&gt; August-September from the Arabuko-Sokoke Forest. A sample:

&gt;&gt; &lt;https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S20359559&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Saturday October 6, 2018 Albert Baya observed one at Lake Jilore
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; There are multiple September-October eBird reports from Gede Ruins.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; There are multiple reports from multiple sites around Watamu and further
&gt;&gt; inland on Mida Creek from August-October.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Also a couple of October reports from Kalifi, a couple of August reports
&gt;&gt; from Vipino Ridge, and numbers of reports from the Mombasa area (Mamba
&gt;&gt; Vilage Crocodile Farm, Haller Park, Bamburi, etc)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; There are also numbers of eBird reports from Shimba Hills in late July,
&gt;&gt; August and September.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Plus various other reports from coastal areas.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Good birding,

&gt;&gt; Dear Brian. The Ngulia bird I think was caught in the early morning (no
&gt;&gt; doubt arriving in the night).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Other dated records that we have are:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Historical specimens from Mombasa area Sept-October 1900.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 50+ in mangroves around Vanga (Lunga Lunga) 29 April 1990. Certainly
&gt;&gt; suggestive of a movement ( returning north maybe ??)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Malindi August 1984; Sabaki early November 1989.
&gt;&gt; My breeding record at Gede was in August.
&gt;&gt; Very vocal around Witu and the Kipini conservancy during October 2006, but
&gt;&gt; gone by late November onwards.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Mombasa area: present June-August. Also a single November record.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; There are NO RECORDS from Sunbird Tours to the north Kenya coast during
&gt;&gt; January and February which would point to it being absent from the coast
&gt;&gt; late November - March /April.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So it seems to be largely present on our coast from April - mid November.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Reportedly resident all year at Dar-es-Salaam and on Pemba, but on
&gt;&gt; Zanzibar largely October - February only.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Only a couple of nest records cards that I know of, one of which was is
&gt;&gt; unreliable. The other points to an early October breeding (Kenya coast).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Hope this helps. It certainly points to it being a migrant to our coasts
&gt;&gt; April-October.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Best wishes
&gt;&gt; Don

&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks for this Don,
&gt;&gt; &gt; That Ngulia bird was certainly a migrant, can you remember if it was
&gt;&gt; &gt; caught at night because it&#39;s likely that&#39;s when they move but if late
&gt;&gt; &gt; November it&#39;s getting pretty late. It also begs the question why it
&gt;&gt; &gt; would be so off course if it were going south, if coming north it has
&gt;&gt; &gt; plenty of space in which to deviate, but going south it can&#39;t have
&gt;&gt; &gt; started moving from very far north of Ngulia anyway! Ngulia is 180km
&gt;&gt; &gt; from the nearest piece of coast which is strangely equidistant all the
&gt;&gt; &gt; way from Kilifi to Mombasa! In Horn of Africa it states it occurs in
&gt;&gt; &gt; Somalia north to the Jubba and Shabeelle Rivers where it is &#34;a
&gt;&gt; &gt; presumed resident.&#34;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Do you know of any completed nest record cards for Kenya?
&gt;&gt; &gt; Two interesting kingfishers in succession!
&gt;&gt; &gt; Best for now

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Dear Brian. All very interesting. All I can offer is one year I recall
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; finding a Mangrove Kingfisher nesting in the hole of a tree in the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; middle of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Gede Forest. It was going to the edge of the forest (thick bush) and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; taking
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; food back to the young. Certainly not crabs !!
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Remember the one ringed at Ngulia on 01 December 2003. Long way from
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; any
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; crabs for sure.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Worth calculating in a straight line how far that was from the nearest
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; known
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; locality at the coast.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
