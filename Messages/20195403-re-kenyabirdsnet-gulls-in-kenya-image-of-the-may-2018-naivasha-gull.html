asleep in the foreground this was on th late date of 20th May. Does

&gt; Hi Brian,
&gt;
&gt; I am following the conversation with interest. I was in Naivasha in February
&gt; 2018 and took some photos of what I Iisted as LBBG. Please have a look and
&gt; let me know if you think they might be something different. List link

&gt; Would be great to get YLG in Kenya but I hope they don’t spread there like
&gt; they are here in Rome!
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;

&gt;&gt; Hi Shailesh,
&gt;&gt; Thanks for stressing that we take an interest in the large gulls we
&gt;&gt; see in East Africa. I currently have four nominate Caspian Gull
&gt;&gt; records in with the East African Rarities Committee awaiting
&gt;&gt; consideration, one Kenyan and three Ugandan. But also have another
&gt;&gt; half-dozen records to submit later that may involve Steppe and
&gt;&gt; Yellow-legged Gulls. For the people that went to see the Caspian Tern
&gt;&gt; at Lake Naivasha in May 2018, and saw a larger and paler-backed gull
&gt;&gt; with the Baltic (Lesser Black-backed Gulls) images of this bird have
&gt;&gt; been sent to Klaus Malling Olsen who authored the gull book you are
&gt;&gt; referring to, and his response was that this can only be a
&gt;&gt; Yellow-legged Gull!
&gt;&gt; Best for now
&gt;&gt; Brian
