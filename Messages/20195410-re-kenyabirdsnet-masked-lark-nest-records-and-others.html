  <pre>Hi Chege,
This is all very interesting, was it at Bulisa you found the Starling
and Masked Larks. The Starlings there are the closest I know to
Marsabit,
Best for now

&gt; Dear all
&gt;
&gt; Greetings hoping this finds you all well.
&gt;
&gt; This morning, Edwin Gichohi, two British birders (Chris and Denise Lamsdell)
&gt; and I while birding north of Marsabit came across an individual Masked Lark
&gt; carrying food. We tried to follow but never got a clue where the nest was.
&gt; Not far later an individual took off about 2mtr from my foot and there was a
&gt; nest with two eggs. About 3cm deep and 3 wide (internally) attached is the
&gt; foto of the nest.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Then later during the day while photographing Bristle-crowned Starlings
&gt; feeding together with White-crowned Starling realized one wasn’t super
&gt; active like the others and never flew away while others did. I checked just
&gt; to find the immature bird was full of ticks only on the head. I extracted
&gt; about two dozens of ticks and there were quite a lot of tiny ones that my
&gt; fat fingers would not remove. Never seen a bird before infested by the large
&gt; “cow” tick. And the bird looked petty weak.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Other nesting records includes last year in Nov an Abbort’s Starling nesting
&gt; on the same tree with Silvery-cheeked Hornbill in Castle Forest, 3 weeks ago
&gt; while catching white-eyes for research work was another nest of
&gt; Silvery-cheeked Hornbill in Castle Lodge and one seen along the road
&gt; collecting mud and flying a different direction from the current nest
&gt; meaning there must be another pair breeding.
&gt;
&gt; Many thanks and best regards
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 4th NOVEMBER 2019
&gt;
&gt; Nigel Hunter picked me up from the house at 6.30am, it was going to be
&gt; a serious days bird-atlassing in Nairobi National Park, as we were
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; spending the day with Sidney Shema. It was also good to show him just
&gt; how good “Finch Pentad” really is, and how it really is the runawayst
&gt; wishes
&gt;
&gt; chege
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; contender for the richest avian diversity for a 9 km sided square, on
&gt; the whole African continent. Before Nigel arrived I had recorded
&gt; Black-headed Oriole and Black-collared Apalis, two species we were
&gt; otherwise, not encountering today amongst the staggering 170 other
&gt; species we were to record just in that one Pentad. This morning (5th)
&gt; by 8.00am, in our paddock as well as the two species yesterday, I had
&gt; African Goshawk, Gymnogene, Barn Owl, our lost Golden-tailed
&gt; Woodpecker, the season’s first Blackcap, (which was the only
&gt; Palearctic apart from Eurasian Bee-eater and Barn Swallow),
&gt; Yellow-whiskered Greenbul, White-starred Robin and Parrot-billed
&gt; Sparrow and the most staggering of all the misses yesterday
&gt; Emerald-spotted Wood-Dove! I will take a few forays out during the
&gt; course of today to see if there are any more additions, as a few
&gt; common species are not revealing their presence.
&gt; Back to NNP, we covered all the accessible squares in the Park,
&gt; closing the days total for species inside the Park at 206. There were
&gt; no particularly unusual finds, but it was a very good day.
&gt;
&gt; We met up with Sidney, at 6.45am and being a Monday there was no
&gt; queue, and after completing the formalities we had a walk around the
&gt; car-park before going in. Species in the car-park not recorded later
&gt; were Cinnamon-chested Bee-eater, Snowy Barbet, Green-backed Honeybird,
&gt; Brown-backed Woodpecker and Northern Double-collared Sunbird.
&gt;
&gt; It was quiet driving down to Ivory Burning Site, and rather dull there
&gt; as well, but the Zanzibar Greenbuls were singing well and the seasons
&gt; first Black Stork flew by. Nagalomon Dam had a rise in water, and the
&gt; island appears to be getting smaller, there were only a couple of
&gt; immature Black-crowned Night-Herons, a black-billed Great Egret was
&gt; present also, ten African Darters of which a few appeared to be on
&gt; nests, an adult Fish Eagle was keeping watch and the only migrant
&gt; waders here were a couple of Black-winged Stilts, Green Sandpiper and
&gt; a Common Sandpiper. A possible Marsh Warbler crossed from the dense
&gt; scrub on one side of the road to equally dense cover on the other, but
&gt; not seen thereafter. White-rumped Swifts were flying around the
&gt; Mokoyeti bridge at the outlet to the dam, and by now, it was time to
&gt; take the back road to Hyena Dam.
&gt;
&gt; We were finding a good number of birds along here, one flying eaglet
&gt; was at the Fish Eagles nest, one of just two Augur Buzzards, a
&gt; Red-faced Cisticola at the creek was important as it meant that we
&gt; finished the day with all ten Cisticola species, and this is the most
&gt; unreliable. There were male Red-collared Widowbirds in colour but with
&gt; brownish edgings to the wings, at the units the House Sparrows,
&gt; Village Indigobirds etc., were waiting for us, but also a Spotted
&gt; Flycatcher and the first Tree Pipit for the season. Just before
&gt; arriving at Hyena Dam we broke the news to Sidney that our tradition
&gt; was that we do not eat breakfast until we can leave Hyena Dam with 100
&gt; species recorded up to there, we left Hyena Dam with 115. The dam had
&gt; another Fish Eagle, eight Black-winged Stilts, a pair of Long-toed
&gt; Plovers, the seasons first Common Snipe, Greenshank, ten Wood, three
&gt; Green and two Common Sandpipers, a few Barn Swallows and a Sand Martin
&gt; resting amongst the numerous Plain Martins present, and finally three
&gt; Greater Blue-eared Starlings.
&gt;
&gt; Taking the circuit along the Mokoyeti we picked up African Water Rail
&gt; at the oxbow, another Black Stork, a lone Marabou on the vlei, also
&gt; still present in the evening and it was the only one seen all day! The
&gt; first few of over a dozen Black-winged Kites seen today, the days only
&gt; Wire-tailed Swallow, a Nightingale flew off the side of the road near
&gt; the Mokoyeti Bridge and sat for a while in a bush, a seasonal first,
&gt; but no Nightingales were heard anywhere. Back at Nagalomon Dam was the
&gt; days first African Spoonbill.
&gt;
&gt; We set off for Kingfisher Picnic Site, but detoured to drive through
&gt; the forest section just on top of the Kisembe plateau, in the forest
&gt; we found the first of three Tawny Eagles for the day, as well as
&gt; Narina Trogon, Yellow-rumped Tinkerbird, Cabanis’ Greenbul, White-eyed
&gt; Slaty Flycatcher, Willow Warbler and Black-and-White Mannikin, all of
&gt; which were not encountered again. We also found a party of another
&gt; four Tree Pipits. As time was running away now we did not take the
&gt; road alongside the Kingfisher Swamp, added a few at the picnic site
&gt; but strangely not Red-throated Tit, and Banded but not Brown Parisoma!
&gt;
&gt; As we passed the old burnt area there were a pair of Shelley’s
&gt; Francolins, and the season’s first Booted Eagle, a pale bird. Another
&gt; seasonal first was a young Isabelline Shrike with the only rufous
&gt; being the tail, and a second similar bird seen later near “The
&gt; Beacon.” On the road to Ololo we had a pair of Secretarybirds with one
&gt; on a nest atop a Balanites, a male Bateleur, a pair of White-bellied
&gt; Bustards, the seasons first Isabelline Wheatear and the only wheatear
&gt; of the day, a few Speckle-fronted and ten Grey-headed Social-Weavers.
&gt; Because it was 1 pm now, much later than we usually arrive at Ololo,
&gt; it was quiet but Brown Parisomas were noisy and so was a Greater
&gt; Honeyguide. Towards Leopard Cliffs were a few Eurasian Bee-eaters,
&gt;
&gt; The late hour also meant no singing Pallid Honeyguide below Baboon
&gt; Cliffs although the Lesser in the same fig, was very vocal, and nearby
&gt; the young Martial Eagle was on its nest.
&gt; Climbing the hill away from the Mbagathi we had a lone Grey-headed
&gt; Silverbill, but more interestingly it was carrying nesting material
&gt; and although African Silverbill has nested in the Park, Grey-headed
&gt; has never suggested that it did though I suppose we should not be too
&gt; surprised. In the woodland above Hippo Pools we had the first Spotted
&gt; Thick-knee recorded at this site, a Long-billed Pipit and several more
&gt; Speckle-fronted Weavers, whilst along the river we found the season’s
&gt; first Steppe Eagle, and likewise first Red-backed Shrikes with two
&gt; adult males and a female, followed by the first Whinchat and another
&gt; three different birds seen around the dam near the Empakasi junction.
&gt; Whilst not following all of the Rhino Circuit because of recent
&gt; flooding we drove into the woodland as far as enough to find three
&gt; Red-throated Tits and Lesser Masked Weaver, and also entered Athi Dam
&gt; from the west side as the Pipeline road access would almost certainly
&gt; be treacherous. The water level was well up and only fragments of
&gt; margin, otherwise the water was in the vegetation. Species found
&gt; included four White-faced Whistling-Ducks, a couple of Yellow-billed
&gt; Storks were the only Storks present, a couple of African Spoonbills
&gt; and Black-crowned Night-Herons, a Striated Heron, Great Egret, a
&gt; drinking Secretarybird, adult Fish Eagle, Lappet-faced Vulture, four
&gt; Water and one Spotted Thick-knee, only four Black-winged Stilts, a
&gt; Marsh Sandpiper, three Greenshanks, two Little Stints and three Ruffs,
&gt; and the best bird being an adult Whiskered Tern. Banded Parisoma and
&gt; Lesser Masked Weavers were in the mellifera stands.
&gt;
&gt; On the return which was rather hurried as we were getting late, a
&gt; Little Grebe on the Vulture Drinking Pools and a couple of Banded
&gt; Martins over the adjacent grassland, on flooded ground near “The
&gt; Beacon” were pairs of Yellow-billed Duck and Red-billed Teal, another
&gt; Shelley’s Francolin, and in another flooded area, an adult Martial
&gt; Eagle standing in water where the only prey could have been frogs!
&gt; Also a pair of Pangani Longclaws in the grasslands, at Karen PS Dam
&gt; another White-faced Whistling Duck, a male Pallid Harrier and
&gt; Rosy-breasted Longclaw when almost back to the Hyena Dam run-off where
&gt; there was a superb sight of three adult and one immature Black Storks
&gt; by the road. The first pair of Grey Crowned Cranes at last made
&gt; appearance with another pair on the way to Langata Gate, and for the
&gt; up to now missing Black Crake today we stopped back at the Oxbow along
&gt; the upper Mokoyeti, and called one out with the App!!!
&gt; It was fairly uneventful on the way to Langata Gate where we exited at
&gt; 5.50pm.
&gt;
&gt; Some muddy sections had not dried out after the rains last week, and
&gt; could be hazardous.
&gt;
&gt; Mammals were widespread with no major concentrations, apart from Athi
&gt; Basin and adjacent river.
&gt;
&gt; The Gladiolus that used to be ukambensis is having a major flowering
&gt; whilst altogether the flowers are not very impressive in spite of the
&gt; heavy rains.
&gt;
&gt; Best to all
&gt; Brian
&gt;
&gt; KEY TO MONTAGE
&gt;
&gt; 1 YELLOW-BILLED DUCK
&gt; Only one pair seen, but unusual to have them at nearly eye-level. An
&gt; underrated attractive duck.
&gt;
&gt; 2 COMMON WAXBILL
&gt; Very common, but the pattern in breeding is very intricate and not
&gt; often appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; 3 BOOTED EAGLE
&gt; Small numbers winter locally, and this is the first to arrive back in
&gt; NNP this season.
&gt;
&gt; 4 ISABELLINE SHRIKE
&gt; Two red-tailed shrike types were seen today and in both the patterns
&gt; were similar. The only rufous on the bird is the tail, and the bird
&gt; is quite attractively marked.
&gt;
&gt; 5 BLACK STORK
&gt; These four were together where the stream that crosses the Hyena Dam
&gt; run-off crosses the road.
&gt;
&gt; 6 WATER THICK-KNEE
&gt; This is three of the four seen at Athi Dam.
