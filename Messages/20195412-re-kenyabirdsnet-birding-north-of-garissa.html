      <p>Hi Chege,<br clear="none">
That's a superb report, with many gems. The Bafirawari Flycatcher<br clear="none">
images superb. They bring the tail right over the back like a<br clear="none">
Scrub-Robin, neither inland Pale or the smaller coastal Pale which is<br clear="none">
also a possible separate species, do this.<br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
Intrigued by the Somali Sparrows north of Garissa, are they nominate<br clear="none">
without any trace of yellow and do you have any images? Following the<br clear="none">
recent confirmation that Itai, Ben Mugambe and I made that they were<br clear="none">
still at Archer's Post, I prepared a submission to the East African<br clear="none">
Rarities Committee to get nominate Somali Sparrow getting recognised<br clear="none">
as occurring in Kenya as at present it isn't. From your description it<br clear="none">
sounds like Somali is going to be a successful invader and stiff<br clear="none">
competition for the House Sparrows in the sub-desert. We had no Somali<br clear="none">
Sparrows at all on our trips, but the thought that they could occur<br clear="none">
had not entered anyone's heads as a remote possibility until they were<br clear="none">
found at Shaba Gate! Now we might be in for a major incursion and<br clear="none">
people should check through the sparrow flocks, they could already be<br clear="none">
widespread along the coast. If you have some images, I would like to<br clear="none">
add them as an addition to the submission to extend the currently<br clear="none">
limited range of nominate birds.<br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
Your mystery bird, well it's a mystery to me as well. I will really<br clear="none">
have to have closer looks at the images, there is something oddly<br clear="none">
babbler-like about the bill, it could equally suggest  starling or an<br clear="none">
insectivorous weaver, from initial glances I haven't a clue but will<br clear="none">
have a good look. Is it multiple individuals or one off, habitat,<br clear="none">
habits, size and most resembles?<br clear="none">
Best for now<br clear="none">

&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt; Some 3 days before the e-Bird’s Global Birding Day (4th May) a friend and I<br clear="none">
&gt; thought we should go to north of Garissa in search of a Collared Lark and<br clear="none">
&gt; other birds that would not be recorded by others.  We were to leave<br clear="none">
&gt; afternoon of 3rd as both of us were busy but the last minute he changed his<br clear="none">
&gt; mind sighting of insecurity as a thought. So there was no way I could go up<br clear="none">
&gt; there alone. At around 6pm I decided then I would go to Mwea National<br clear="none">
&gt; Reserve and the best was to go spend the night there and have an easy start<br clear="none">
&gt; the day after. So by 7pm I was on the road. Along the way I thought may be<br clear="none">
&gt; birding this road to Garissa Town would for sure offer quite a few more<br clear="none">
&gt; super species than Mwea. Check if the Red-naped Bush Shrike are still on<br clear="none">
&gt; the<br clear="none">
&gt; road. And so I drove further spending the night at Mwingi arriving at<br clear="none">
&gt; 930pm..<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt; Sometimes in the middle of the night something told me no….try go north of<br clear="none">
&gt; Garissa. So I woke up at 4am and left.<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt; When the morning light was on I started birding somewhere past Bangali and<br clear="none">
&gt; Garissa. Stopping any place I thought it looked good till around noon when<br clear="none">
&gt; I<br clear="none">
&gt; arrived Garissa. Along the many stops I made the only raptors I say were 1<br clear="none">
&gt; Black-winged Kite that I saw on my way back at the same spot, an Eastern<br clear="none">
&gt; Chanting Goshawk and 2 Pygmy Falcons. I had never seen a flock of about 40<br clear="none">
&gt; Cut Throats before; feeding on the ground with the Red-billed Quileas.<br clear="none">
&gt; Eastern Yellow-billed Hornbill appeared almost in every small somali<br clear="none">
&gt; manyattas along the road. My first bird of the days was a Comb Duck flying<br clear="none">
&gt; alongside the car for a few seconds. Buff-crested Bustard calling from the<br clear="none">
&gt; bushes. Not far from Garissa there were quite a number of Acacia<br clear="none">
&gt; turnbulliana (which is the habitat you’d find  or expect a Collared Lark)<br clear="none">
&gt; and none seen but also the soil type was softer clay and not sandy red..<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt; Two Egyptian Geese were seen pas Garissa past the town and 2 more on a road<br clear="none">
&gt; side water pool about 70 km north of Garissa.  The first flock of Vulturine<br clear="none">
&gt; Guineafowls was some 20km past Garissa on the turn off to Mado Gashe and<br clear="none">
&gt; road to Liboi about 30 birds next to a small trading centre at the junction<br clear="none">
&gt; where there were a 5 Feral Pigeons feeding by the police road block, a<br clear="none">
&gt; Cattle Egret and 1 Sacred Ibis. Mourning Collared-Dove were in good numbers<br clear="none">
&gt; but while watching one at a trading centre  some 20km south of Mado Gashe<br clear="none">
&gt; dropped on the ground from a tree, kicking the legs for a few seconds and<br clear="none">
&gt; died. Talking to the local they said it’s been happening. I did pick the<br clear="none">
&gt; carcass and now it’s with the NMK’s Ornithology Department just incase they<br clear="none">
&gt; wanted to undertake some lab test.<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt; Also were a few Ring-necked Dove and Laughing Dove compared to others while<br clear="none">
&gt; only 3 Speckled Pigeons were seen. Once in a while, while driving a Namaqua<br clear="none">
&gt; Dove or two would fly across the road and others seen on the water pools.<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt; Was pretty dry but there were these  little pockets of water pools along<br clear="none">
&gt; the<br clear="none">
&gt; road showing some signs of rains some days ago and hence some Black-faced &amp;<br clear="none">
&gt; Chestnut-bellied Sandgrouses, 3  Wood Sandpiper, Spur-winged Lapwing and on<br clear="none">
&gt; one pool 3 marabou’s Storks. Black-headed Lapwing were seen before Garissa<br clear="none">
&gt; and after and a family of 5 with two thet looked subadults. A flock of over<br clear="none">
&gt; 100 Little Swifts at the Tana River bridge at Garissa town and quite a few<br clear="none">
&gt; African Palm-Swift. Crowned Lapwing were seen 3 times along the road and<br clear="none">
&gt; Black-headed Lapwings seemed the commonest of the genus. Blue-naped<br clear="none">
&gt; Mousebird, Von der Decken's Hornbill and few Northern Red-billed Hornbill,<br clear="none">
&gt; only a pair of Somali Bee-eaters were seen some around 80km North of<br clear="none">
&gt; Garissa.<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt; 3 late Blue-cheeked Bee-eaters were feeding by powerline before Garissa.<br clear="none">
&gt; Only 1 Lilac-breasted, 1 Eurasian &amp; 1 Rufous-crowned Roller not far from<br clear="none">
&gt; each other were seen before Garissa town. Black-throated Barbet would call<br clear="none">
&gt; all along from Bangali all the way to my last stop which was about 15km to<br clear="none">
&gt; Madogashe.  Only a pair of Cardinal Woodpecker but aA few sighting and<br clear="none">
&gt; calls<br clear="none">
&gt; of Nubian Woodpecker. Pygmy Batis were quite common by calls but had this<br clear="none">
&gt; pair of Eastern Black-headed Batis and who were singing. Brubru’scall was<br clear="none">
&gt; quite a common  after every few stops but Pringle's Puffback  called most<br clear="none">
&gt; places and you could hear them even when driving. Two sightings of<br clear="none">
&gt; Red-naped<br clear="none">
&gt; Bushshrike both before arriving to Garissa and on the north of Garissa..<br clear="none">
&gt; Rosy-patched Bushshrike were located only 3 times but were vocal in many<br clear="none">
&gt; places.<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt; And so the migrants seen during the two days were 3 Blue-cheeked<br clear="none">
&gt; Bee-eaters,<br clear="none">
&gt; 1 Eurasian Roller,  ½  dozen Barn Swallows, 2 Common Whitethroats, 1 Lesser<br clear="none">
&gt; Gray Shrike, 3 Wood Sandpipers, 2 Willow Warblers.<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt; 1 Taita Fiscal was seen west of Garissa and no Somali Fiscal was seen. 2<br clear="none">
&gt; flocks of Northern White-crowned Shrike North of Garissa, Fork-tailed<br clear="none">
&gt; Drongo<br clear="none">
&gt; were common one with very pale windows on the wing and quite very short<br clear="none">
&gt; fork. Pied Crows in every other small trading centres,  I think 3 groups of<br clear="none">
&gt; Chestnut-headed Sparrow-Lark, Pink-breasted Larks were very common and sang<br clear="none">
&gt; or whistled quite often. No Collared Lark was seen but I might have heard<br clear="none">
&gt; one on my way back to Garissa around 1830hrs but could not locate since it<br clear="none">
&gt; sounded far inside the bush and the sun was disappearing and I didn’t want<br clear="none">
&gt; to get lost in the bushes at that time while I was still 70km to Garissa<br clear="none">
&gt; town. While I was further north this place had some showers. So I marked<br clear="none">
&gt; the<br clear="none">
&gt; place and the following day I went back and tried calling and walking<br clear="none">
&gt; through the bushes and none was seen or heard. It was a good site Acacia<br clear="none">
&gt; turnbulliana were in numbers but without locating a single bird and they<br clear="none">
&gt; were seemed quite common and available on every trip I’ve been there<br clear="none">
&gt; including the two trip with Brian Finch and others then I doubted my single<br clear="none">
&gt; whistle I heard of the lark and pulled it out of the list<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt; The road is now all superbly tarmacked and about to reach Mado Gashe, 1<br clear="none">
&gt; Sombre Greenbul was singing while crossing the bridge in Garissa town.<br clear="none">
&gt; Dodson’s Bulbuls were seen but only about 3 times.<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt; A pair of  Somali Crombec were seen and located each day but quite common<br clear="none">
&gt; was Northern Crombec. I kept an eye for Phillipa’s Crombec ( a bird Brian<br clear="none">
&gt; Finch thought might be in Kenya since the distribution comes to the border<br clear="none">
&gt; of Kenya and Somali but only recorded in Somali) So I did try look and<br clear="none">
&gt; locate each crombec I would hear. Only 1 pair of Yellow-vented Eremomela<br clear="none">
&gt; were seen, a few calls of Grey Wren-Warbler while Pale Prinia were common<br clear="none">
&gt; together Red-fronted Warblers.<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt; I somehow lost my attention of flycatchers to searching for the lark and at<br clear="none">
&gt; last can’t figure out who was commoner between the Grey and<br clear="none">
&gt; Bafirawari/Wajir<br clear="none">
&gt; Flycather but observing a few times the Wajir I realized he liked to pump<br clear="none">
&gt; up<br clear="none">
&gt; the tail to an extent like a Red-fronted Warbler or Tawny-flanked<br clear="none">
&gt; Prinia…..a<br clear="none">
&gt; habit I cannot recal seeing while we were up there………..Ebird has it as a<br clear="none">
&gt; full species when logging but after it does count it as Pale Flycatcher.<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt; White-browed Scrub Robin were as usual very common and vocal.<br clear="none">
&gt; Golden-breasted Starling weren’t as common as before and Superb Starlings<br clear="none">
&gt; were the very commonest bird to encounter. Not a single Shelly’s Starling<br clear="none">
&gt; was seen reminding me of a trip with three Swedish birders up there and<br clear="none">
&gt; Collared Lark was pretty common and singing and presumably more than 500<br clear="none">
&gt; Shelly’s Starling in flocks of 50s. This was in Dec and the rains were good<br clear="none">
&gt; with over 100 individual Grasshopper Buzzards.<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt; Fischer's Starling were common. Eastern Violet-backed Sunbird and Hunter's<br clear="none">
&gt; Sunbirds with White-bellied version of Variable Sunbird being commoner<br clear="none">
&gt; thank<br clear="none">
&gt; any other sunbird.<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt; About 3 sightings of male Northern Grosbeak-Canaries. Somali Bunting.<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt; House Sparrow were seen in Garissa and hybrid of House Sparrow and Somali<br clear="none">
&gt; at<br clear="none">
&gt; Shimbir Trading Centre. However, at least a few Somali Sparrow were present<br clear="none">
&gt; in every small trading centre and a few feeding closer to those nomadic<br clear="none">
&gt; Somali Manyattas. Atleast on the second trip with Brian Finch, Ben Mugambi,<br clear="none">
&gt; Itai Shanni among others in 2009 I cannot remember any of the Somali<br clear="none">
&gt; Sparrows and this time they were present and commoner. I bet had I checked<br clear="none">
&gt; every sparrows in Garissa there might have been some already there.<br clear="none">
&gt; Parrot-billed Sparrow were quite common in pair or 3-4 birds.<br clear="none">
&gt; Yellow-spotted<br clear="none">
&gt; Petronia, Red-billed Buffalo-Weaver seen feeding along the road and a place<br clear="none">
&gt; past Bangali where they are nesting on a pylon. White-headed<br clear="none">
&gt; Buffalo-Weaver..<br clear="none">
&gt; White-browed Sparrow-Weaver were not as common compared to other habitats<br clear="none">
&gt; they are found.  Black-capped Social-Weaver were only seen on one tree<br clear="none">
&gt; where<br clear="none">
&gt; they were nest building north of Garissa. Red-billed Quelea were probably<br clear="none">
&gt; around 100 individuals.<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt; 3 pairs of Green-winged Pytilia , about 15 Gray-headed Silverbills which<br clear="none">
&gt; seems not recorded in Garissa and the east but recorded right on the border<br clear="none">
&gt; of Kenya and Somali on the Somali side.<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt; Others birds seen after the global birding day included African Bare-eyed<br clear="none">
&gt; Thrush, Wattled Starling, Somali Tit, Abyssinian Scimitarbill, Lesser<br clear="none">
&gt; Masked<br clear="none">
&gt; Weaver, Tsavo Sunbird.<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt; There was also a birds similar to a Northern Brownbul but wing pattern of<br clear="none">
&gt; rufous edging like a whitethroat. Could not tell what it was and never got<br clear="none">
&gt; a<br clear="none">
&gt; chance to photograph. They were two birds. Then one bird that I<br clear="none">
&gt; photographed<br clear="none">
&gt; but I cannot put a name on it. Looked size and shape like a Donaldson-Smith<br clear="none">
&gt; Sparrow-Weaver or even size of a petronia (or slightly bigger) but smaller<br clear="none">
&gt; than a buffalo weaver and Fischer’s Starling that weren’t very far., this<br clear="none">
&gt; bird once flew and patched inside the bush and came out. The bill looked<br clear="none">
&gt; strong but not as strong a buffalo-weaver and not as thin as the Fischer’s<br clear="none">
&gt; starling. Flicking the wing and the tail like a petronia on patching, all<br clear="none">
&gt; the belly, chest and throat was white and seemed to have no contrast. I had<br clear="none">
&gt; the bird for about a minute. It’s attached.<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt;<br clear="none">
&gt; Weirdly, Desert Warthog were common in every trip I did up there but this<br clear="none">
&gt; time there was none but there were, a single Reticulated Giraffe, Gerenuk,<br clear="none">
&gt; Dikdik??????, Unstriped Ground Squirrel and a pari of African Wild Cats.<br clear="none">
&gt; For<br clear="none">
&gt; not seeing a single Collared Lark I would still be interested to go again<br clear="none">
&gt; and a bit north may be Black-billed Scimitarbill (which would be a lifer)<br clear="none">
&gt; might be present there.<br clear="none">
