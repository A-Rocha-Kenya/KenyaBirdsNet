  <pre>Hi Adam and all,
This does make a lot of sense, and it does look like Zanzibar, I
suppose the birds in Tsavos are in equally arid habitat, though I
think they like the Commiphora, not too keen on acacia.
They are certainly pretty variable in their given ranges when it comes
to ground colour, but Chege saw them and it will be interesting to
hear what he feels about this suggestion,
Best for now
Brian
