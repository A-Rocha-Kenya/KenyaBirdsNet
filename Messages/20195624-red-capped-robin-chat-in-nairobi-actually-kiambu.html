  <pre>Greetings Birders

Nature Kenya’s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk had another fabulous day on October 23 at Paradise Lost in Kiambu at the edge of Nairobi. We recorded all the local specialties: Five kingfishers (Giant, Pied, Grey-headed, Malachite and Pygmy), seven weavers (Grosbeak, Baglafecht, Spectacled, Holub’s Golden, Eastern (African) Golden, Speke&#39;s and Village), Red-throated Wryneck and Grey-olive Greenbul for a total of 85 species (in 3 and 1/2 hours).

The unexpected came when Patrick Ngotho spotted a Red-capped Robin Chat on the forest floor below the roaring waterfall! It’s the first I’ve seen in the Nairobi area. Was it a migrant to the Coast, blown off course as it migrated back to the South? Or did it come from the probable small resident population on Ol Doinyo Sabuk? In any case it was a thrill to see.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
