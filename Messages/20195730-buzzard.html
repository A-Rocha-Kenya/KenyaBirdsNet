  <pre>Greetings birders

As Brian noted, I used to think of July and August as quiet birding months, but Nature Kenya&#39;s Wednesday Morning Birdwalks have been recording long bird lists in July and August this year.

At Karura Forest this week (Aug 28) we had a variety of raptors – Ayres’s Hawk Eagle, Long-crested Eagle, Augur Buzzard, Black Kite. Then a buzzard flew rapidly across the playing field near the swamp. It seemed the right size, shape and coloring for a dark Common (Steppe) Buzzard. But August 28 seems awfully early. Any advice?

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
