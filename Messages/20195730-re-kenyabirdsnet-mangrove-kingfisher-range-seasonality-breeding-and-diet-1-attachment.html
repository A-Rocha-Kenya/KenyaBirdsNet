      <p>Dear All,<br>
A friend and well-known author in South Africa Hugh Chittenden, has<br>
asked me about the diets at the nest site and away from the nest of<br>
Mangrove Kingfisher in the East African region. I told him that living<br>
a long way from the coast I had little intimate experience with the<br>
species. But I would put his queries on the net, advising that we have<br>
very many dedicated birders living along the coast, and they would<br>
surely be able to assist with some details.<br>
<br>
What he found is that Mozambique birds feed on crabs almost<br>
exclusively in the winter, but move inland to breed in wooded areas<br>
and then live on a crab-free diet and feed this to their young.<br>
<br>
In KZNatal the birds are present only as non-breeding wintering birds<br>
and feed almost exclusively on crabs, then migrate south in summer to<br>
breed on the Eastern Cape when they appear to feed on invertebrates<br>
and not crabs, and crabs seem not to be in the diet that they feed<br>
their young.<br>
Hugh was asking the question, is there an important reason for this<br>
change of diet seasonally. (See attachment).<br>
<br>
He was asking what they feed their young on at the nest in East<br>
Africa, and the diet when non-breeding. Personally I have only thought<br>
of Mangrove Kingfisher as a migrant from further south rather than a<br>
breeding bird, but they do seem to call territorially.<br>
They are a breeding resident on Pemba Island, but only seasonal to<br>
Zanzibar, and there must be some information from these two islands.<br>
The local literature does not suggest that it is a migrant in EAf, in<br>
fact it states that it is a resident along the entire seaboard.<br>
<br>
They do wander, and I have only ever seen one bird that was obviously<br>
lost and that was in Tanzania on the Pangani River west of the<br>
Usambaras (where the Black-bellied Sunbirds breed).<br>
<br>
So it would appear that Hugh has a very interesting subject that he is<br>
studying and it would be great to help him out with all the<br>
information from EAf that we can provide. From reading what is said<br>
about our birds, we still have much to learn too, as I think that to<br>
call it just a breeding resident is oversimplification.<br>
<br>
This is what Hugh wrote, and there is an attachment…<br>
<br>
“Hi Brian,<br>
…I&#39;d like to request info from you regarding Mangrove Kingfishers. I<br>
have been monitoring this species of late. They are winter visitors<br>
here (Mtunzini, just south of Richards Bay). I&#39;ll forward recent<br>
correspondence and photos in a separate email.<br>
The two different populations in southern Africa have different<br>
breeding strategies. The South African population migrates south to<br>
the eastern Cape estuaries to breed, then returns to n KwaZulu-Natal<br>
region for winter. The Mozambique birds act differently. They simply<br>
move inland and breed in termitaria they find in lowland<br>
forest/woodland during the breeding season. No suitable termitaria in<br>
South Africa.<br>
So, the southern African birds essentially have a summer and a winter<br>
diet. The winter diet is predominantly crabs (mangrove habitat), and<br>
summer a mix, with few, if any crabs I should think. There is little<br>
published data on food delivered to nests.<br>
I have been trying to understand these feeding regimes because it<br>
interests me why Mangrove Kingfishers in SA migrate south to breed<br>
when there are Barbet and Woodpecker holes available to them here in<br>
KZN??<br>
I&#39;d be interested in what your birds feed on summer, versus winter?<br>
Regards<br>
Hugh<br>

<br>
It would be interesting to copy your email to kenyabirdsnet, so we can<br>
all see the interesting facts emerging,<br>
<br>
Best to all<br>
