  <pre>Hi Shailesh,
The genus Anthene (hairtails because most have six projections on the
rear of the hindwing) are a difficult group, at a glance it looks like
you have A indefinita female above and male below,
Best for now

&gt; Hi Shailesh!
&gt;
&gt; GREAT to hear you&#39;ve been photographing butterflies!
&gt;
&gt; The very BEST thing to do with your images is to upload them to the
&gt; Virtual Museum - a sister project to the Kenya Bird Map and the data for
&gt; which is openly shared with anyone who wants to use it. The Lepidoptera
&gt; Society for Africa (LepSoc), uses the VM as a basis for depositing
&gt; &#39;specimens&#39; (in the form of a digital image) and there are recognised
&gt; experts who go through and identify photographs that people submit for
&gt; them.
&gt;
&gt; This way your images are going to be kept for ever as an historical
&gt; record of that species at that place and time and will contribute to
&gt; building up our knowledge of butterfly distribution and status.
&gt;
&gt; If you need help in how to upload, there are help documents on the site.
&gt; It&#39;s a bit slow to start with, but once you&#39;re used to it, it&#39;s very
&gt; straight forward.
&gt;
&gt; Best,
&gt;
&gt; Colin
