  <pre>Greetings birders

Nature Kenya’s Wednesday morning birdwalk visited the Arboretum full of Gloriosa lilies and newly-leafed trees yesterday May 29.

There we saw an African Paradise Flycatcher mainly rufous in colour, but with long white upper tail feathers. It was interesting because we had observed a similar one at the KWS mess in Nairobi National Park earlier this month! Is it a trend?

Other highlights included Ayres’s Hawk Eagle, Hartlaub’s Turaco, Lemon Dove and Green-headed Sunbird.

Wishing you good birding,

Fleur
