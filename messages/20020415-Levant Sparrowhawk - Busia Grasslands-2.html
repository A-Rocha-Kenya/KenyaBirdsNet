Dear all.

On the 15th of April (during a 4 days trip in the
Busia grasslands) an adult male, Levant Sparrowhawk
was observed flying west in an area between Alupe and
Malaba (south of Malaba hills). 
As far as we know, this is only the 4th record to
Kenya.

Other interesting things were:

* 1 Palm nut Vulture - near the Sio river south of
Nambale, 13/4/02. another individual was observed
north of Alupe in the next day, it might have been the
same bird. this bird/s are possibly wanderer/s from
Uganda.

* Buff spotted Woodpecker - this forest species was
observed in the Mungatsi grasslands (about 2 Km north
of the Mungatsi market), 13/4/02, not really on it's
preferred habitat.

Either then these interesting sightings, some common
and less common  Western species were seen during this
trip, these included:
* Dwarf Bittern 
* Green Crombec
* Rock Pratincole
* Black bellied Fire finch
* Purple starling
* Compact Weaver
* Red headed Lovebird
* Yellow throated Leaf love
* African White tailed Nightjar
* Yellow fronted Tinkerbird
* Whistling Cisticola
* Marsh Tchagra
* Brown Twinspot


On behalf of the observers: 
Bernd de Brujin, Shailesh Patel and my-self, Itai
Shanni, I wish you all Good Birding.
