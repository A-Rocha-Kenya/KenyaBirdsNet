Hi members
This sighting has taken long but I just think might be important for our
records if any are kept. About a month ago had an African Finfoot  seating
on 2 eggs, the nest hanging over the waters of Ngare Nyiro river that joins
Ewaso, at Mpala research centre,was about a foot in length but a shallow
source. Was about a meter from the bank. The first time I saw the nest a
female was seating incubating and the beautiful no sorry but handsome male
about 20m away. The second time found the female not far from the nest and
had a chance to see the two chicken size or slightly larger eggs with
reddish brown speckles/making concentrated on the blunt side of the egg-
took a photo. The third visit some days the nest was empty/predated and
looked abandoned. However during those second visit had Slender tailed
Mongoose or mongeese whatever they are right next to the branches hanging
the nest. Looking at the nature of the branch it,s a possibility that the
nest might have been predated by the mongoose. Then a week ago the high
level of water flooding has just taken the nest. Hoping this never happen to
many of our finfoot, it a nice breeding record.

Also had a pair of Spotted Thickknee with to fledglings in between a flock
of Vulturine guinea-fowl and they kept oppenig the wings to umbrella the
youngones, each standing on each side of the wings. Just try to imagine!!!!
Definitely, was a birding fantastic behaviour.

I have a Question, while driving at night on this dry country, mostly on the
black cotton parts dominated by the Acacia drep,  I have several times seen a small bird,
size of a Grey headed silverbill (I wonder whether it is) roosting on the
road and ends up being flashed from their sleep. When flying all I can see
is grayish brown ( not pretty sure-It's at night) with a clear visible white
rump. If you know what it is, I'll appreciate to hear from you.


Good Spotting
