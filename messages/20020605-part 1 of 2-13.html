Dear all,

I was in the Kedong Valley below Kiamese (on the Magadi Road) Mon 3rd June, and found by chance three territories of Bush Pipits.

There is little doubt that the species is an annual breeding visitor to the Ngongs at this time of year.

 

Just for interest I have included photos taken recently from Magadi Road of Pringle’s Puffback (note how on this disjunct population  the little black there is on the nape compared to illustrations from material elsewhere) and a very wet Fire-fronted Bishop having a bath with Crimson-rumped Waxbills and Lesser Masked Weaver.

 

Best to all

 

Brian
