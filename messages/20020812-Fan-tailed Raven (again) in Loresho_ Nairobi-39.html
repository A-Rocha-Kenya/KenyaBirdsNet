Dear all,

This morning a Fan-tailed Raven flew over Loresho in northwest Nbi, mobbed by a pack of Pied Crows. It was the second sighting in this locality, after one (presumably the same?) bird was seen on Oct 21st last year, so it might be 'around'. 

By the way, now is a good time to see Peregrines in Westlands, since a pair has bred again on the Agip building (Barclays) and what seemed like (at least) one young bird is flying around. 

Good birding,
Bernd
