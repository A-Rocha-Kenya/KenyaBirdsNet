<div class="moz-text-flowed">Dear all,
<br>
<br>Over the past week, several very interesting observations came to our 
notice. Even though the birds were seen several weeks ago, that doesn't mean 
they're not there anymore....
<br>
<br>On 6th July, a potential first for Kenya was observed and photographed by a 
visiting Dutch birder, Jan Bisschop: a summer adult Arctic Tern, at Sabaki 
River mouth. Descriptions and pictures will be submitted to the Rarities 
Committee.
<br>
<br>In early July, a Dunlin in summer plumage was found at the northern en of 
Lake Nakuru by Steve Easly.
<br>
<br>In late July, Nigel Redman and group found a Dickinson's Kestrel along the 
road to the Thika settling ponds.
<br>
<br>Good birding!
<br>Bernd
