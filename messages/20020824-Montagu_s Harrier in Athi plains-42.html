Dear friends
i am very happy to be back, thoug i had great time in Northern Kenya.
today in Athi plains, about 10 Km east of the Whisteling Thorn hotel 
on a burnt field 3 male Montagu's Harrier (1 3rd year) was flying 
over catching insects. it seems to me to be very early for that 
species isn't it?  
eitehr then that in my trip in Northern Kenya i had the great 
oppertunity of seeing (at last) some very nice Northern species  
including the Thekla Lark, Crested Lark, White-crowned Starling, and 
a House Bunting.
all the best for now and happy birding to all.
Itai
