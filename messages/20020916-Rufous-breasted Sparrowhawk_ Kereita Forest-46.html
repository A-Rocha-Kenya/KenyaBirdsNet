Greetings

A fine view of a Rufous-breasted Sparrowhawk perched on a dry tree at the
edge of Kereita Forest on 15 September 2002 was seen through the morning
mist by some sixty people on the Nature Kenya Sunday Birdwatch.

Chris Hill pointed out that Rufous-breasted Sparrowhawk is marked with a "B"
in the Check-list of the Birds of Kenya, 3rd edition, 1996, EANHS.  This
surprised me, as books indicate it as 'widespread', and Bill Harvey even
included it in the Annotated Checklist of the Birds of Nairobi, 1997.  I
thought it was just me who had not seen one until recently.
