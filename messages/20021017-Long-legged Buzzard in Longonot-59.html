Hi Guys:

I thought I would share this with you. On 10th October, I went to 
climb Mt Longonot. It was a beautiful day having rained the previous 
day. As we commenced our ascent from the park gate towards the top 
of the crater rim, I observed a Buteo like raptor soaring above us. 
It was larger than a common buzzard. On closer view, I noticed dark 
carpal patches and a distinct "washy pink" tail.

I confirmed that this was a pale morph Long-legged Buzzard , Buteo 
rufinus

Also yesterday 16th October, whilst flying back from Kedong Valley, 
we came across a flock of about 25 to 30 Eurasian White Storks near 
the Kiserian Pipeline Road.

Happy Birding folks.
