Dear All,

I have just spent a couple of days at Tsavo Discovery Centre, on 
Rukinga Ranch. I think it was by far the best dry country birding I 
have ever experienced, and yet again I was not birding. So I thought 
I would share this with you, and encourage you to fraternise the 
place, which is a well spent Ksh2500 per day full board. Bookings 
through East African Ornithological Safaris.

Sitting down to breakfast, some 12 metres from the bird-table was a 
very interrupted meal….. the most numerous birds visiting the table 
were Fischer's Starlings, Steel-blue Whydahs and Grey-headed 
Silverbills, but certain species were omnipresent like Dodson's 
Bulbuls, sundry doves and d'Arnaud's Barbets. Other visitors 
included Paradise Whydah, Cut-throats, G-w Pytilias, Blue-cap 
Cordonbleus, Black-faced Waxbills, Bare-eyed Thrushes, and rice 
eating Scaly Chatterers!. There were many other species, even Golden 
Pipits in full regalia walking around the table.

Next to the breakfast place, there were four trees each with an 
active nest, respetively Drongo, Bare-eyed Thrush, Fischer's 
Starling and Pygmy Batis.

Around the boma fence Pringle's Puffback, Three-streaked Tchagra are 
quite noisy and giving song-flights.
