Dear All,

i just came back from 3 night in Ngulia, and here are some records..

on the 6th of Dec' when driving to Ngulia i found a very late 
Eleonora's Falcon just after the turn to Mchakos on the main road. 
the bird was of a dark morph, straggeling to hold with the strong 
wind, and flying very low.
when coming to the park through Tsavo gate, Jamson's Firefinches and 
Purple Indigobirds were jumping all over, especially when climbing 
the escarpment. other interesting birds along the road to Ngulia 
lodge, were at least 3 Common Button-Quails, and 1 Corncrake!!

and last but surly not least, an adult dark morph Long-legged Buzzard 
was passing by mid day yesterday (the 8th) above the lodge on his way 
south.

happy birding to all,
Itai
