Dear members.
Today when coming to take photos of the Ferruginous Duck in Thika 
sewage ponds, we (Brian Finch and Myself) found some more northern 
migrants that are worth mentioning.

Just after parking the car and starting to look for the duck, we 
spotted a Common Redshank and a Spotted Redshank on the nearest 
corner to the car park of the 1st pool.

Later after enjoying these 2 local rarities we scanned the next pool 
and to our surprise a Female Tufted Duck was swimming in the water 
together with the Southern Pochards.
After this surprise we found our reason of coming - the Male 
Ferruginous Duck that who was 1st located during the water-birds 
counts on Sunday Bird-walk of Nature Kenya.

it was not long after, that in the same pool (only the 2nd to scan) 
we found another rarity, a Female/Juv Gadwall!!! was swimming and 
feeding along the rest of the ducks.

a very pleasant end to a 10 days trip in Western Kenya.

i will be sending the full summery of this trip and photos during the 
following days.

all the best for now and happy birding to all.
Itai
