<div class="moz-text-flowed">Dear all!
<br>
<br>While preparing for the waterbird counts at Lakes Naivasha and Elmenteita 
last weekend, on Friday afternoon, we found a Woodchat Shrike on the 
lakeshore near KWS Hippo Camp (annex to KWSTI). It was still present in the 
same area on Sunday.
<br>
<br>The camp is signposted off the old Naivasha road, near town; a track leads 
to the lakeshore but you'll need to pay KSh 100 for entering at the KWS 
buildings. Walk to your right from the track end, where the bird was 
perching on thistles at 2-300 m from the track. This is a great birding area 
in general (Black Herons, Water Thickknees were present as well; the counts 
produced a Black-headed Gull at Crescent Island).
<br>
<br>Good birding!
<br>
