Dear All,

Today just after noon time, Bernd de Bruijn and Myself found 2 
Eurasian Griffon Vulture in NNP.

The 1st bird was spotted within a group of Ruppell's and African 
White-backed Vultures at the "Vultures Pool".
While taking photos and admiring the bird (which was a JUV bird) a 
second bird landed with another group of Vultures and this 
individual seems to be in an Imm plumage (much more rufous then the 
Juv').

Both birds were photo and can be seen under the Photos section of 
the group, in the Rarity Sub-folder.

Either then that, it is just the increase in Lesser Kestrels in the 
park that is of interest.

Happy birding to all,

Itai
