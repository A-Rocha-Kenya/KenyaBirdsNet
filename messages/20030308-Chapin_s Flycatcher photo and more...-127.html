Dear all,

I have just loaded the photo of a Chapin's Flycatcher, taken by 
Brian Finch in Kakamega forest to our photos section.

Another interesting new photo is again from Kakamega, by Brian. This 
is an Imm' Ayres's Hawk-Eagle a morph that is Not very regularly 
seen in Kenya.

Just to remind you all, the photo section is for Rare, Interesting 
and Mystery birds. In few weeks I will delete most of the photos, in 
order to make place for new ones.
Therefore, if you haven't looked at this folder yet, you are all 
very welcome to do it as soon as possible.

Happy birding to all,

Itai
