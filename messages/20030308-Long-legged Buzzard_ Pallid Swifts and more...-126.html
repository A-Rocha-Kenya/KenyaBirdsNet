Dear All,

Today in the Afternoon, Brian and I went birding in the Mukoma ridge 
(the area of IUCN offices, overlooking the NNP plains).
On the way there, a local rarity was spotted on a wire; Broad-billed 
Roller, might be the first Malagasy migrants that we have here for 
the season.

While birding in the forest an Ad. Ayres's Hawk-Eagle was flying 
overhead, and later on a dark morph Imm' Long-legged Buzzard was 
spotted, coming down towards the trees. When coming back to Brian's 
garden a Lemon Dove was walking away from us on the forest floor.
 
To finish this amazing afternoon, 2 Pallid Swift were flying over 
our heads and a few Lesser Kestrels were coming down to roost. 

So who said that garden birding can't be fun!?

Itai
