Dear all!

In Nairobi National Park yesterday, two Long-legged Buzzards were seen in the area of Olomanyi dam. One was a pale morph immature, of which good photographs were taken both in flight and perched. A darker and probably adult bird was seen in the same area. These birds seem to be attracted to the recently burned grasslands, which they patrol in a slow flight with much hovering (without wing flaps) and head pointing downwards (visible from long distance). 

Near Masai Gate, a single Pallid Swift was seen well; during its short migration peak, this species seems to like Mbagathi gorge a lot. 

In Olomani dam, pictures were taken of a 'funny', comparatively short-billed snipe, and even though comparison with a more typical Common Snipe was possible, lack of a flight view probably preclude clinching it as a Pintail... but do look out for it when you are birding there. 

Good birding!
