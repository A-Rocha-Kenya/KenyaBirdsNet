Dear all,

Last Saturday Shailesh Patel and Bernd de Bruijn observed a Barred Warbler in Nairobi NP, in a tiny bush that it was sharing with an Olivaceous Warbler and a Common Whitethroat (south of Athi Basin dam). 
After a night that started off clear but had much rain later on, there had been a nice fall of a broad spectrum of migrants, but notably of Garden Warblers which were singing from 'nearly every bush' in the forest. 

Good birding,
Bernd &amp; Shailesh

P.S. after studying pictures of the earlier reported snipe sp. at Olmanyi dam, it was noted that most plumage features and the long tail projection suggested Common rather than anything else; thus it may have been a Common Snipe with an unusually short bill and cold-coloured plumage...
