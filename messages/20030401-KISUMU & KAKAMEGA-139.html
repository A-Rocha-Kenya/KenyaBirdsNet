<br>Hellow birders!
<br>
<br>I Just want to comment that over the weekend of 21st mar to 24th march I&nbsp; 
went birding at Kisumu Impala park and with concern I came a cross two 
LEVAILLANT'S CUCKOO Perching on the same tree same branch which I though was 
rather unusual with cuckoo.
<br>
<br>Along Dunga beach I saw the yellow fronted tinkerbird plus not to mention 
the blue headed cocual and slender billed weaver.
<br>
<br>At Kakamega forest I saw the yellow crested wood pecker both the male and 
female that had no yellow crest with it and again this was so definate to me 
as both birds were feeding on the same trunk and when I tooked out my feild 
guide it didn't show how the female looks like and this led me to conclude 
that the female of this specie rather lacks the yellow crest. Again I was 
able to see the crested guineafowl,purple throated cuckoo shrike the female 
specie,and not to mention the Dusky crested flycatcher.
<br>
<br>Do have a nice birding time
