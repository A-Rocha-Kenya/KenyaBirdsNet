<br>
<br>I would just like to mention that during the last nature walk at the above 
said forest, I sited the LEVIALLANT CUCKOO that was new to the site and even 
to the checklist that I was assisted with by Fluer Ng'weno.
<br>and also we saw the LIGHT MORPH OF THE BOOTED EAGLE ROOSTING on the pond for more than ten minutes and later flew on the sky such that we were able to see every of needed field characteristics.
<br>
<br>Thanks and do have nice time birding
