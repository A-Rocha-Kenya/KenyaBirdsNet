Dear all,

today 26th April, Brian Finch, Bernd de Bruijn and myself had some 
nice mixture of species along the Magadi Rd.

it started with a nice male Little Bittern (the nominate Palearctic 
race, minutus) along the Olorgasailie River. that was the most 
interesting bird around the river, but it was nice to see that there 
are still few migrants around, mainly Sedge Warblers and few Barn 
Swallows.

later on, when coming back (about 35 km south of Kisemese) a 
brilliant ad. male Golden Pipit gave us some very nice views and in 
the same area another migrant, a Lesser Grey Shrike was flying around.

the first African Cuckoo for the season was calling at one point, and 
maybe soon we should start look for the Afrotropical migrants to come.

all the best and happy birding   
Itai
