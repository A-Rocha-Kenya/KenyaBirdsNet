A visit to Kitale, Saiwa, Kongolei and the Marich pass at Easter raised some
interesting birds and we were not drowned out as expected.
Staying at the Barnleys jsut beyond Saiwa Swamp we had the advantage of
Maurice's expertise.   Some of the more interesting species (for us, anyway)
:
The garden produced  Double toothed Barbet, Blue spotted wood dove, Blue
flycatcher (many), African Thrush and Ross' Turaco.
Saiwa swamp, after a very wet night was full of birds rather later in the
morning,
40-50 European White storks on a ploughed field just outside the swamp,
seemed rather late in leaving but others have also noted the same this year,
likewise the Eurasian Bee Eaters. Others were Grey Apalis, Grey capped
warbler, Lesser swamp Warbler, Marsh Tchagra, Black billed weaver, Grey
winged Robin and White crowned Robin chat, Purple throated Cuckoo shrike,
both male and female, Luhder's Bush shrike, Grey headed Negro finch, and
Mountain Illiadopsis.   
Kongolai and the Suam river -  
White crested Turaco, House Martin, Lesser blue eared Starling, Bronze
tailed Starling, Scarce swift, Brown babblers, Black headed Gonolek,
Beautiful sunbird and White headed rough wing Swallows.
The Marich Pass, Sigor and the Wei Wei Valley 
Levaillant's Cuckoo, Broad Billed Roller, Shining Sunbird, Lead coloured
Flycatcher (a pair) - amongst many others 
Finally on a  small dam/swamp near Saiwa we found the Hautlaub's Marsh Widow
Bird (in non-breeding plumage - (full acknowledgement to Maurice).  
The drive back over the Cherangani Highway, with little time for birding -
Lappet-Facet Vultures, White Necked Raven and Spotted Eagle.
