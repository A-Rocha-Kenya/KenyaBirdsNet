<div class="moz-text-flowed">Hey BIRDER'S whereever you may be!!
<br>
<br>I just want to say that yesterday 5th of may 2003 I and DAVID plus Elena From 
Alaska U.S.A we went birding at the above said park and just as we entered 
the main gate and drove towards the Hyena dam we spotted two Saddle billed 
stork plus the Leopard at the same site.
<br>
<br>Drivimg further towards Embakasi pond we spotted the Red backed shrike and 
the Red-tailed Shrike almost at a distance of about 300m apart.&nbsp; following 
the discriptions that were on the book it stated that this bird is available 
untill early Apri and this is even Late April and more of early May .Can some 
one tell me what is this ? I will be happy.
<br>
<br>As we approached the pond just onthe road and where we have an acacia tree 
and some water we again spotted the 3 Grey rumped Swallow perching.
<br>
<br>As we were coming out at around 1530 hrs there was heavy rain that lasted 
almost 30min and on road at the rock No.18A we spotted This intra-African 
Migrant Crake, The AFRICA CRAKE ON THE ROAD.
<br>
<br>Thanks and have nice birding time, I will post my Late April Sighting in 
Samburu and Mara sooner.
<br>
<br>Thanks Joseph Kariuki
