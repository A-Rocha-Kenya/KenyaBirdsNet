<br>"We travel together on a little space ship,
<br>dependent upon its vulnerable reserves of air and soil,
<br>committed for our safety to its security and peace,
<br>preserved from annihilation only by the care, the work,
<br>and I will say, the love we give our fragile craft"
<br>
<br>Adlai Stevenson 1900-1968, US Statesman
