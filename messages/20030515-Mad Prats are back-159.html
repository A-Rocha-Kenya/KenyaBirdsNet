Weds 7th, Mida Creek at high tide in the evening - GREAT views of roosting 
waders from the bird hide including a couple of Madagascar Pratincoles which 
I've not had 'on the deck' at Mida before, just overhead. They were chased off 
repeatedly by mostly Whimbrel... (what do Whimbrel have against Mad 
Prats...??!). Also there was a single Eurasian Oystercatcher or 'Oik' - only my 
second for Mida, the first being in 1991 tho' I have had others in more recent 
years at Sabaki and at the mouth of the Tana.

Atr Sabaki River Mouth on Saturday 10th and had 450+ Mad Prats flying in from 
the north east (foraging over the scrublands and woodlands?? Interesting...) 
and there were a heck of a lot more I didn't count. Total probably 650-900 
birds on the estuary. Awesome! 

Also visited Lake Chemchem on 10th which is currently totally dry as well... 
(we are in the middle of a drought here on the coast...), had Mangrove 
Kingfisher there and two more around Mwamba including a juv, that was caught 
and ringed at the w/e. This species appears to be migratory around here, 
disappearing for many months and reappearing around now... Talking of Afro 
migrants, all the Red-capped Robin Chats are now back mimicing Crowned Eagles 
and Emerald Cuckoos and otehr species I don't recognise from their breeding 
grounds; and the first Spotted Ground Thrush for the year was seen on the 
nature trail in Arabuko-Sokoke near Geded Forest Station last week. A thorough 
search was made in Gede Ruins forest but none were located. Af. Pygmy 
Kingfishers returned about a month ago now with one flying into my house 
yesterday afternoon and perching on the ceiling fan briefly (the fan wasn't 
switched on!!).
