Greetings all

Seasonal and semi-permanent wetlands have filled all around Nairobi, and the
birds are spoiled for choice.  The little pond at the bottom of Eliud Mathu
Valley in Runda has become a big pond, and on 21 May 2003, Nature Kenya's
Wednesday Morning Birdwalk recorded a Little Bittern, two Lesser Moorhens,
and the usual array of other wetland birds.

Nature Kenya's Sunday Birdwatch visited the seasonal lake at the back of the
Ngong Hills on 18 May 2003.  We discussed the name with the local people,
and were told it was Ntashat ­ meeting point (of the waters).  When spoken
it sounded like "Ndashant", a refinement of our previous spelling of
Endashant or Indashant.  It had only just filled, but there were already a
number of waterbirds.  Whiskered Terns, most in breeding plumage, filled the
air and patrolled the waters.  Flying over muddy areas of water they were an
extraordinary sight, appearing silver above and orange below as the pale
underwings reflected the red waters.  We estimated about 200 Whiskered
Terns, and among them were two White-winged Terns that missed the migration.
We could clearly see their dark underparts contrasting with white rumps.

We would love to hear of other seasonal or semi-permanent wetlands within
easy reach of Nairobi, Fleur
