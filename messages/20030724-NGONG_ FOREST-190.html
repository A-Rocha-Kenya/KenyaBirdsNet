<div class="moz-text-flowed">Hi Birders!
<br>I do wish to say that during last Saturday of 19th July 2003 Nature walks at 
Ngong' road forest sanctuary we had a nice time with Tony and another client 
who had paid a visit all the way from Nanyuki to come and have birding with 
us at the forest. I would say that the day was so promising for the client 
as she came up with a few lifers' at the same time we were able to spot two 
dove male and female of the EASTERN BRONZE NAPPED PIGEON which is not common 
in the forest and of which we think must have come from the highland forests 
after the cold season. We had a nice look at the bird for more than 
30minutes although it is definitely a secretive bird, I spotted it on flight 
after seeing a Dove that passed me, and quickly I noted the white nape and 
hurriedly chase up to where it landed. And as we were ending the walk we 
spotted the VIOLET BACKED STARLING in it full plumage, so if you are one of 
the few who say that now and then that you'll like to have the walk at the 
forest it high time you act on it as we don't know whether the next walk 
we'll see the OLIVE PIGEON which is also a highland specie and some times is 
seen in the forest!
<br>
<br>Do have a nice birding time!!
