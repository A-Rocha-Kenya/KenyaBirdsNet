I woke up in the middle of the night on the 20th August, to hear a 
very strange sound from behind the house where we have a big baobab. 
I was still half asleep and at first it sounded a bit like a sick 
Colobus. I then got up and listened carefully (and was wide awake by 
now). It was coming from the top of the baobab and being repeated 
time and again. I then realised what it was having watched one in the 
garden in daytime calling. It was a Southern Banded Snake Eagle. I 
tried to shine a torch on it but the tree was still in full leaf, so 
I couldn' t see it. It obviously didn't approve of the torch light 
and flew off. I have heard them calling at night before but  much 
further away.
