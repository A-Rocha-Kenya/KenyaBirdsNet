Hi Everyone,

We had an interesting sighting on the Sunday 5th October during the 
International Birdwatch. We live at Shimoni, and on the sunday 
morning went up to an area where sugar used to grow, there are still 
one or two small clumps of old sugar cane there. Sitting on the top 
of one of the canes was a bird which I swear was a Streaky Seedeater. 
It is not usually a coastal bird and I have not seen one here before, 
but I have seen plenty up-country. It was too big for the Lemon 
Rumped Seedeater, and did not have a yellow rump and it was 
definitely not a Pintailed Whydah.  I cannot think what else it could 
have been and would be glad of any comments. I obviously did not 
include it in my check list because I did not know what it was, but 
have sent the sighting to Itai Shanni.
