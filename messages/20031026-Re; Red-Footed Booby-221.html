Hi everyone,

Pat was out fishing on Friday morning off Funzi Island, north of 
Shimoni with some anglers who were casting for yellowfin tunny off 
the bow. They were being "attacked' by a Juvenile Red Footed Booby!! 
He was really going for the lures as they hit the water and then was 
dive bombing the anglers, who were beginning to get a bit worried. 
Luckily one of them hooked up and while he was playing the fish the 
school of tuna moved off and the Booby followed them.
He was smaller than the Masked or Brown Boobies and brown all over 
with yellowish green feet. Pat got a very good look at him obviously, 
and looked up our Seabirds of the World when he got back and he was 
unmistakeably a Juvenile Red Footed Booby.
