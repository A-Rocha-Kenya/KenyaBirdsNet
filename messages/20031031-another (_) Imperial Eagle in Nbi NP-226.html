Dear all,

While looking for the Stone Curlew this morning, without luck, a nice consolation prize was a immature Imperial Eagle flying overhead at the same location. The bird looked young because of the tawny coloration of underparts; further it was a large, long-winged eagle with a noticably long tail and longish neck (and no white band bordering the underwing coverts), quite different from the more stocky appearance of Steppe (which was fairly numerous) or Greater Spotted. The inner primaries formed a paler window in the wing and the hand showed seven 'fingers' and some barring was visible on flight feathers and tail (ruling out Tawny). 

It was photographed, and followed by another bird which might have been an Imperial as well, but observations and pictures of this second bird were not completely conclusive: this bird was much darker, gliding with a closed, narrow-looking tail, but the wings (seven fingers as well) did not look quite as long comparitively. 

The park is well worth a visit these days, with the combination of burned areas and good passage! 

Good birding!
Bernd
