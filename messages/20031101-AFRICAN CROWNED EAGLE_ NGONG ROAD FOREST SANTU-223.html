<div class="moz-text-flowed">Hey Birders!
<br>
<br>I just want to say that during todays Nature walk at the Ngong road forest 
sanctuary we had a nice morniong and we spotted African Crowned Eagle on a 
strategic point on the path.
<br>
<br>Funny to note was that it had built a nest on this croton tree. We spent at 
least 10-15 minutes watch at it and then we left as some of the people opted 
to walk than seeing birds. we noted that it was guarding the nest. Isn't 
this a good sign of this bird to be seen nesting and happen at the time the 
sanctuary is trying to put a fence on the forest? Biggest question will 
remain. Does this forest has enough food to support this Eagle?
<br>
<br>We also spotted the Brown Chested Alethe this being the third time I have 
seen it in this forest.
<br>
<br>There were much more interesting birding all in all. If one can wish to have 
a check on it can directly contact Ngong road forest sanctuary office.
<br>
<br>Happy birding out there.
<br>
<br>Regards
