Hi everyone,

Just returned to the UK from our annual birding trip to Kenya. 5 of us
(self, Paul H, Ben Mugambi, Bernard Gitari and Betty Mugambi) spent 23
days in various locations. We  thought you might be interested in the
following records:

14 October - Lake Jipe. White-cheeked Tern.

18 October - A small group of approx 15 Crested Guineafowl at Mwea
National Reserve (a very exciting one for Paul and I as we didn't
expect to see this species). 

25 October - Juvenile Great Crested Grebe at Ziwa (44km from Eldoret
on the pools along the Matunda Rd).  This was an interesting sighting
for us since it's been a very good year for Great Crested Grebe in our
bit of the UK so we'd been spending a lot of time photographing them
during June-August - we didn't expect to photograph a juvenile in
Kenya!

26 October - Sirikwa Safari Camp near Kitale -  Western Violet-backed
Sunbirds were nesting.

Regards
Helen Harris
