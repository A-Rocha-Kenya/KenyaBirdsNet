<div class="moz-text-flowed">Dear all,
<br>
<br>Last week Klaas de Jong and I spent a few days birding around Watamu, some 
of which together with Colin Jackson, Francis Argyle, Willy Kombe and 
Jonathan Mwachongo. Some records of interest:
<br>
<br>- on the evening of Nov 10th, large brown swifts were seen over Cynometra in 
Arabuko-Sokoke Forest, but the narrow strip of sky over the dense vegetation 
permitted only split second views, none of which with binoculars; one call 
was heard, similar in structure to Eurasian Swift but much 'drier' in sound. 
On the evening of 12th another such swift was seen over the Jilore road 
(also Cynometra) and had a visible white throat. We thought these might well 
be Forbes-Watson's, but better views would be needed for positive 
identification.
<br>- a White Wagtail and a Red-necked Falcon were at Sabaki River mouth on 
10th, as well as small numbers of Broad-billed Sandpipers.
<br>- a Temminck's Stint, a Little Ringed Plover and a pair of Malindi Pipits 
were at Lake Chemchem on 13th.
<br>
<br>A group of experienced local bird guides of the forest have recently 
established their own company, headed by David Ngala, called Spinetail 
Safaris. They arrange transport and guiding to all birding hotspots in the 
area. Recommended if you are looking for specific (forest) species and/or do 
not have your own transport. They can be reached at

<br>
<br>Good birding!
<br>best wishes,
<br>Bernd
