Dear all,
Yesterday (6/12/03) in NNP together with Gonc'alo Elias, Rui Vrito 
and Brian Finch; few interesting migrants have been located.
While stopping for a morning cap of coffee (which was lacking so we 
used Coke instead) at Kingfisher Picnic site we had a great view of 
a Sub-ad Imperial Eagle circling over our heads (this should be the 
same individual that was first spotted at the same place in late 
Nov'. just above him a Sooty Falcon was flying SE. after a while at 
the Vulture Pool a Eurasian Griffon Vulture gave us a good show 
(with all the Ruppell's &amp; White-Backed Vultures around it was very 
easy to differentiate). Another bird there was a juv' bird that had 
a mix characteristics of both Ruppell's and Eurasian Griffons; the 
wings looked very much like a juv' Eurasian while the legs were 
mottled just like Ruppell's. In recent years, there are more and 
more records of mixed pairs of these two species both in Ethiopia 
and in Portugal; can this individual represent a Hybrid? Not far 
from the Vultures there were more then 3 individuals of Pink-
breasted Longclaws, all in full song.

Today (7/12/03), the Eurasian Griffon Vulture was spotted again, at 
the same place, this time the presumed Hybrid was not to be found.

Happy birding to all,
Itai
