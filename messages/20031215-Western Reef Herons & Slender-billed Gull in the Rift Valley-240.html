Dear all,

During the last weekend (starting from Friday `Jamhuri day') 
together with Brian Finch we went to look for migrants in both 
Naivasha and Nakuru. In general there is a feeling of very few 
migrants around.
Plenty of Ruffs and Little Stints are already around, but the 
numbers of other waders are still relatively low. During the whole 
weekend, just one Curlew Sandpiper was seen (at Nakuru NP). 

On Friday the 12th one Common Teal was seen at Limuru with some 
Garganey, Northern Shovelers and few Pintails. Together with them 
were roughly 200 Maccoa Ducks and many Southern Pochards.
Later, from Hippo point at Naivasha, 2 Great Crested Grebes were 
seen and an Osprey was flying in the north parts of the lake. 

The next day (sat' the 13th), we spent in Nakuru NP. Below Baboon 
Cliffs, we found the 2 `residents' Dimorphic Egrets (these birds are 
reported from Nakuru for that last 5 years now!) Together with them, 
we found 2 more dark-grey Egrets. After a close inspection of the 
bill and legs colour and shape, we could easily identify them as 
Western Reef Herons, (are these birds are migrants??). Later on, 
among the many local Terns and Gulls, few Black-headed Gulls were 
bathing at the Njoro River mouth and at the Northern tip of the 
lake, one juv' Lesser Spotted Eagle was flying low above the marsh. 

On Sun' the 14th, on the way back to Nairobi, we stopped at Lake 
Naivasha Country Club for another short scan. Among the hundreds of 
Grey-headed Gulls, few Black-headed were also flying and roughly 30 
Lesser Black-backed/Heuglin's Gulls could be seen. The biggest 
thrill came from a very pale grey gull, white-headed with only a 
small darkish ear-spot. Larger from the Black-headed Gulls around 
and also longer tailed and necked. It had a very extensive white 
leading edge that was `shining' in the sun. This was a non-breeding 
adult Slender-billed Gull (not a very common species in the last 2-3 
years).
We then continued towards Kieni, where at least 3 Sharpe's Longclaws 
were found (and photographed) and one single Steppe Buzzard was 
flying around.

Hopefully, soon more migrants will arrive and join the ones that are 
here already. 
Enjoy your holidays and happy birding to all,
Itai
