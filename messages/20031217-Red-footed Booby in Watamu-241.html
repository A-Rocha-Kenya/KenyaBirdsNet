It was almost exactly a year ago that we had an adult brown morph Red-footed Booby 
washed up on the beach exhausted and unable to fly... That one Bio-ken snake farm 
managed to recuperate and I ringed and released it. On Dec 7th this year another adult 
brown morph Red-footed Booby was washed up on the beach exhausted and unable to 
fly. This time however it was too far gone and it sadly died the following morning. It's 
currently in the freezer and will be deposited in the collection at the National Museums 
Ornithology Dept.

Otherwise somewhat quiet down here at the coast... other than a Caspian Plover at 
Sabaki on 5th Dec...
