dear all,

i just came back from a 7 days safari in the central
highlands and Massai-Mara.

after Brian's last report on the lack of migrants
around, i was quit happy to see that things are
changing, in every place we've been throughout the
tour there were many Blackcaps and Willow Warblers and
also it seemed that the Wheatears are re-appearing. 

but the most amazing record of this tour (which was
not a birding tour) was of a huge flock of White
Storks, a rough estimate will be of 15,000 birds
flying in 4 groups over Talek area due south on the
22nd of Dec'. 
it was the first time for me to see a group of that
size here in EA (a group that will be more appropriate
up in the Middle-east or the Gibraltar). 

many greetings to the coming holidays and have great
birding,

Itai
