Dear all,

yesterday along the Magadi Rd. (on the big bridge
after Kisemese), one Olive-tree Warbler was seen.
according to Zimmerman et al. there are just few
wintering records. in the last 3 years though, there
is at least one bird being observed along this road
(in different places) during winter. can it be a
regular wintering species in the southern Rift Valley?
(more records will be very welcome).

later on, when approaching Lake Magadi, it was
obviously very very dry. in the pool just near the
gate, not one Plover (Chestnut-banded) could be locate
and only 56 Lesser Flamingos were counted. other then
these Flamingos, not any wader could be seen. where
are all the Plovers? i've seen the lake dry before,
but always i could trace at least 1-2 families of the
Plovers and there are always a few palearctic waders
and Kittlitz's Plovers.

last but not least, 
a report from Bill Clark (who is visiting the country
at the moment) of the very rare dark morph Eurasian
Marsh Harrier at Lake Naivasha (9-10/1/04). it can be
very similar to Af. Marsh Harrier but the ringed tail
of the Af. species is lacking and also the proportions
are different.

Happy birding to all,
Itai
