Dear Itai

Could you possibly forward this question to the
group?.....

When we were in Lake Nakuru National Park we saw a
group of about five 
"Helmet-shrikes". The first bird I examined was a
typical Grey-crested 
Helmet-shrike. It laked the yellow eye-wattle and
had the dark marks at the 
edge of the breast. The bird was no bigger than the
others. However we then 
discovered that the others were all typical
White-crested Helmet-shrikes 
instead.

Does any one have experience of the two species
forming mixed flocks?

Regards

Keith Betton

now, since Keith as already raised the issue, i would
like to support his question with another observation
from late Dec' by Brian Finch and myself, again at L.
Nakuru (House of the Cormorants) where we had a mix
flock of the two species.

since P.p.poliocephalus is not suppose to be in Nakuru
this is a very very strange case (as this is the only
subspecies of White-crested Helmet Shrike that looks
similar to Grey-crested). P.p.cristatus which is known
from L. Nakuru has a completely different wing pattern
and also the yellow eye wattle. so what is going on
with L. Nakuru Helmet Shrikes? does anyone have any
idea?

i know that Mr. Neil Baker is also interested in
collecting more data on Grey-crested Helmet Shrikes
and therefore any observation of this kind (mixed
flocks, new sites...) will be most welcome to him.
