I was at Sabaki over the weekend and again this morning and it is totally
incredible to see the number of birds there right now... in particular the
number of Saunders' Terns which at the end of Jan on the waterfowl counts
I estimated the number to be around 10,000. On sunday (15th Feb) as we
walked out onto the river bank, something disturbed the roosting terns and
gulls and the sky literally filled with them, peppered across the whole
sky and swirling and 'blooming' in several huge flocks. At a conservative
estimate, I put the number at 25,000 birds... There were also about 3-
4,000 gulls and larger terns but on the far river bank and so difficult to
see well.

On Sunday we had a "Rippit" (Red-throated Pipit) and lots of Yellow Wags.
Today was better with my first Eurasian Marsh Harrier (ad male) for the
coast in about 8 years as well as my first Isabelline Shrike for the
coastal strip - a very pale female. Not only that but my first Olivaceous
Warbler for here as well... one singing in an isolated acacia behind the
main dunes. 

Sabaki is such a great birding site with always something of interest to
find there...

Colin
