Dear friends,

as a policy i am asking new members that want to join KENYABIRDSNET 
to give me some basic details about themselves; country of origin, 
why are they interested to join this group...

this last individual (see bellow) has proved me that it is important 
to keep asking these questions, in spite of them being a 
little 'pushy'.

i believe that we should try and prevent from bird collectors/ 
breeders and hunters to get any kind of information from this group 
(though some may be genuine conservationists). it is clearly not 
working in 100%, but at least i am trying to minimize that damage. 

if anybody knows how to handle this legally, he/she is most welcome 
to do so.

all the best,
Itai

I am interested in obtaining Corvids such as "White
Necked Ravens" for
breeding and hoped your list might give me some
information and possible a
list of breeders I can purchase birds/eggs from. I
live in the Houston area
of Texas, and I found out about your list through a
search engine.
