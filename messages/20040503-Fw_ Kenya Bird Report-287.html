Hi Carol: Would you send this on to Kenya Bird Report. Thank you.
                                                   Following  is a brief
report of some exciting birds seen on 14-16 April in Tsavo East Nat. Park.
Within 10 km of Buchuma Gate a group of 8 Amur Falcons were seen in one
tree. At first a single female was seen and than she flew to the others,
some in the tree and others flying about. We had  about 5 minute look at
close range. Seen on the Voi River road east of Aruba Dam about 8 km in
shade of a bush, a pair of Violet-tipped Coursers, also about a dozen
Temmicks Coursers at signpost entrance to Satao Camp, where there is
extensive bushed plain. After many years of birding in Kenya, and looking
for Fire-fronted Bishops, and never seeing, over these 3 days estimate 200
males seen along road from Buchuma to Aruba, and sporadically throughout

park. Among many Common Cuckoos, African Cuckoos--?, was one Levaillants.
Violet Woodhoopoe was another good bird for me, a group along Voi River.
These were among 100 species seen during this trip. Thank you for reports
you send me. My email while in Kenya is <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:cjhimes@hotmail.com">cjhimes@hotmail.com</a>  Thank you
