Dear all,

it seems taht there is a system problem that is sending these 
messages to different members of the group (i got already 2 as if 
they were sent by myself).

please ignore these messages, unless it is coming from my private e-
mail add. (the one that is sending this mail).
i will try and sort this problem soon with YahooGroups 
administrators.

i hope that we will not have to change the server, but if we will i 
will let you all know about it in advance.
sorry again for this mess and hope to sort it out soon,
Itai
