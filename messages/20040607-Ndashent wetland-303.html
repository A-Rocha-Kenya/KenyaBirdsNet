Marc Languay and I visited Ndashent wetland yesterday.  Given that this long
rains was the third highest in 16 years of recording in the Garden, we were
considerably surprised to find it dry.  Last year for example we visited on
6th July and found not only good water but Baillon's Crake.  I thought this
information was worth passing on, in case any of you were planning a visit
to see if there were any crakes present this year.  There are of course
other good birds to be seen in the area.

Best wishes to all

Nigel Hunter
