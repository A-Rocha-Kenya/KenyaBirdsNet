Jambo Birders

I'm reporting some of my sightings from Mpala research Centre in Laikipia since early march till last week on a project investigating the family structures and the family dynamics of the Grey-capped Social-Weavers. Such a good example of co-operative breeding birds living in nuclear or extended families. 

The Mpala Ranch is dominated by Acacia spp with Ngare Nyiru a river that joins up the Ngare Narok to form the Ewaso Nyiro passing through Samburu, Buffalo Spring and Shaba Game Reserves passing through the ranch.

In the Whistling Thorn and Themeda triandra, I've seen severally, flocks and good numbers of the East African endemic Jackson's Widowbirds once a flock of 12 breeding males with females, a flock of 9 breeding males with females, 5 breeding males with females and other smaller flocks hopping and freezing in the tall grass ....indeed a promising breeding habitat. And probably hold a quite substantial population.

Common-Button Quail, hundreds of Alpine Swift. Bush Pipit (subadult) if record accepted which is range extension. A very small pipit with narrow fine streaks on the breast on the open patches of the red soil blended with very minor rocky outcrops.  

Lots of breeding birds of prey along the Ngare Nyiro River with such spp as the African Fish Eagle, Bateleur and Tawny Eagles, Martial Eagle….. all with juvenile and immature youngones

Liechtenstein's Sandgrouses seems common along the rocky hills of the ranch. 

Along the river sometimes a pair of African Black Ducks, African Finfoot, which I know two pairs along the river (might be well common though elusive). 

Other breeding birds in the last few weeks includes the African Hoopoe nesting on the ground on a termite hole with two pullies popping out.

Other creatures of interest other than birds were Rainbow Skink, Variable Skink, Kenya-Dwarf Gecko, Prince Ruspoli Gecko, Southern long-tailed Lizard, Elementaita Rock Agama (a Kenyan endemic) and a probably Somali Gecko. Also Black necked Spitting Cobra that got in to the Land Rover and spit three times on me.....anyway, we needed to go back home. Had to drive with the cobra coiled on the chasis!!!!!  left the car in the bush for over night. In the following morning it was already gone. I think it's a good idea to leave the car in the bush when it happens to you.

And 12 Wild Dogs on my last day trying impalas that had been stocked 5 min ago by a leopard. 

wishing you good birding
