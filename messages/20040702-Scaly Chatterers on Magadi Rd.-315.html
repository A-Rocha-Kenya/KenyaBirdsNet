Dear all,

We went birding today, 2nd July, along Magadi Rd.
Fleur Ng’weno, Shailesh Patel, Chege Kariuki and
myself. The area is very dry now and lot’s of birds
can be seen coming to drink in what left of the
different water wholes.
We started near the 1st bridge at the Comiphora and A.
melifera woodland looking for the Pringle’s Puffback
pair that Brian and I saw about 2 months ago. While
looking for them (with no success) we spotted a group
of 3 Scaly Chatterers!!! jumping in the bushes. This
eastern species, together with the Pringle’s Puffback,
are very interesting as they are not documented in any
book to occur there.
Later on, when we came back we stopped again at that
point and managed to hear the Puffbacks, but could not
locate them in the thick vegetation.

Other than these we had very good views of many other
Magadi birds; Steel-blue Whydah was still in full
breeding plumage and the same is true to Paradise
Whydah.
Many Singing Bush Larks are still flying around
(though not in their display flight) and also Tiny
Cisticolas, Rosy-patched Bush-shrike and more.

Happy birding to all,
Itai
