Greetings birders

At Arabuko-Sokoke Forest on 23 June 2004, a Spotted Ground Thrush seen near
the Mida entrance, by David Ngala and Fleur Ng'weno.  (A first for me, after
many years of walking in Gedi Ruins and Arabuko-Sokoke Forest!)

Nature Kenya's Sunday Birdwatch visited Gitiligini, on the Escarpment
overlooking the Kedong Valley, by kind invitation of John and Jane Mayers,
on 20 June.  Birds were an interesting mixture of highland forest and acacia
woodland species, including Moustached Green Tinkerbird and the race
albicauda of White-headed Barbet.

Lake Solai, some 50 km north of Nakuru, was the destination for the Nature
Kenya weekend outing on June 27, following a pleasant overnight at Flamingo
Camp in Elmenteita.  The seasonal lake was wide, shallow, and beautiful.
The range of birds indicated that the water was relatively fresh, although
at other times it is fairly alkaline.  Among the 60 or so species observed
were more than 24 Grey Crowned Cranes, a pair of Greater Painted-Snipe, and
an immature Great Spotted Cuckoo.

Good birding, 

Fleur
