Dear Bird lovers,

I hope this finds well, only that I am sending you bad news as most 
of you might have heard from different sources.

Thousands of pink flamingos at Lake Manyara National Park have died 
of mysterious disease over the past two months. The cause of the 
deaths has not been established to far, but local and international 
scientists are currently probing the cause of the the deaths.

Some scientists believe could be agricultural pollution, but i think 
it could be of toxicity from green algae (manyara being a soda lake) 
on which these flamingos feed.

You can share this problem with me while waiting for the scientific 
reports, because some sample were sent to Germany and other places 
for investigations.

Regards,
Jasson
