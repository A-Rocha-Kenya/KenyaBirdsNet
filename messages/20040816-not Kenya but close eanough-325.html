Dear friends,

these are all not Kenyan records, but i find them
interesting just because they all show how much is
still to be find in spite of the very good bird guides
that we have for the region.

i am placed in Musoma Tanzania now for the last 4
weeks. in this time i have found many species that
according to the books do not occur around this area
of Tanzania. many of these are species that according
to the maps stop their distribution on the Kenyan
border. as i suspected before i came this is not true.

species like Papyrus Flycatcher, N. Brown-throated
Weaver, Papyrus Gonolek, Black-billed Barbet,
Currther's Cisticola are just few examples for that.

also of interest for the Kenyan side is Orange Weaver
that was visiting my garden twice already (and maybe
is more common also around the Southern points of the
Kenyan lake side).

i hope that the coming migration season will be
interesting. i have already seen migrants around,
including species that are regularly came a month or
two later.

all the best and happy birding,
Itai
