Dear All,

On 28th August, I went up to Nakuru to see if there
was any hope that the Slender-billed Gull seen by
Steven Easley would still be there after he had
found it 25 days before.

I waited at the mouth of the Njoro River, the river
was very full, and was attracting many gulls and
terns where it spilt out into the lake. Searching
amongst the numerous Grey-headed Gulls, there were
two adult Black-headed, and it was not long to wait
before the adult Slender-bill was doing its
ablutions with them. This individual is a nice
adult, complete with pinkish hue, and was duly
digitised. Having attained the objective very early
in the proceedings, this allowed a leisurely full
day around the lake.

In spite of being early in the season, there were
many thousands of Ruffs around the lake, also
considerable numbers of Little Stints but barely
half-a-dozen Curlew Sandpipers, there must have been
a over a thousand Marsh Sandpipers scattered around,
but probably no more than fifteen Greenshank, three
Wood, one Green and six Common Sandpipers. There was
one Black-tailed Godwit in the reedy corner below
Baboon Cliffs, and the only three Ringed Plover,
were all in the south-eastern corner. White-winged
Black Terns amounted to what seemed like tens of
thousands, there were vast numbers all over the
lake, but there must have been well over a thousand
Whiskered which is a high number. Five Avocets only,
and they in the south-east corner, but large numbers
of Black-winged Stilts all around the shore. Below
Baboon Cliffs there were two Western Reef Herons,
they looked just like the ones that were in the same
place last January. One dark Dimorphic Egret near
Hippo Picnic Site on the eastern shore. There was an
early adult male Marsh Harrier there as well. Two
flocks amounted to well over one-hundred Cape
Wigeon, and apart from these there were birds all
around the lake. In July I struggled to find Greater
Flamingo, finally locating two! Now they are in
unusual numbers especially the marsh pools below
Baboon Cliffs and in the east shore marshes. Some
groups amount to several hundred birds. Only one
raft of fifteen Black-necked Grebes seen all day,
and as yet no migrant duck.

One sub-adult Saddle-billed Stork along the eastern
side, where Great Egrets were in large numbers in
the marsh, but the concentration of Yellow-billed
Egrets is unusual for the species. Glossy Ibis in
good numbers and a few strange creamy birds amongst
them.

Probably over a thousand Barn Swallows around the
shore, and Angola Swallow near Muyas Causeway,
something I seem to see every time now, whereas I am
sure I did not see them before. The same goes for
Blue-spotted Wood Dove, which was along the western
road, and again I see it on every visit nowadays,
but cannot ever remember the bird in the past. Bush
birds were very prominent and noisy, being active
all through the morning. African and Black Cuckoos
were calling, the place is having a spring, with
much nesting activity, following the recent
persistent rains. 

The strangest bird of the day, I cannot yet
positively identify. There has been a large die-off
of Lesser Flamingos, and this has attracted unusual
numbers of Pied Crows to the foreshore along the
northern end. Amongst these crows I found a strange
black corvid. The bird was slightly heavier than the
Pied Crows that fed with it, the bill was very
heavy, but not razor-narrow like in Fan-tailed and
White-necked Ravens. The outer tail feathers were
only slightly shorter than the wing projection.
However the bird was all black, apart from a tracing
of white around the shoulders, and a gorget of very
irregular white spots, from the bend of the wing
across the belly. The upperparts were entirely
black, and very glossy. My first thought was a
hybrid Pied Crow/Fan-tailed Raven, but if the Pied
Crow provided the weakest genes, as testified by the
lack of white on the back, little white on the
belly, then why would the tail be the length of a
Pied Crow, and the short tail not be present if
Fan-tailed Raven were the dominant influence. I then
thought of hybrid Pied Crow/Brown-necked Raven, now
more correctly called Somali Crow. But there was no
brownish cast to the head, and a Somali Crow would
be strange enough this far south, let alone it being
a hybrid with Pied Crow. On two occasions the bird
called loudly, and it was a perfect Pied Crow,
however to my ears I cannot tell any difference
between Pied Crow and Somali Crow anyway. The call
no way suggested Fan-tailed or White-necked Ravens.
I took many photographs of the bird with its Pied
Crow friends, but they do not provide any further
clues. The hackle patterns might assist a crow fundi
though. In Ethiopia I have seen something similar
with hybrid Pied Crow and Somali Crow, the two forms
are extremely close, the Somali Crow is just like an
all black Pied Crow! Somali Crow also have white
bases to the black feathering where this would be
white in a Pied Crow, and when the feathers are
ruffled, the white bases show.

Had this bird not have had these white patches, I
would have been sure that the bird was a rather lost
Somali Crow. Anyone interested is welcome to see the
pictures.


On the afternoon of the 29th August, I went down to
Olorgesailie with Richard and Anne Bishop, we had
booked in at the Bandas. There are new bandas,
replacing those burnt down at the beginning of the
year. Comfortable mattresses, pillows and a mosquito
net are provided, and they are very comfortable. We
drove out to Emerit on the road out of Ol Tepesi,
the aim was to go and find Freckled Nightjars, then
spotlight along the road back to Olorgesailie. On
the evening drive we found Bare-eyed Thrush, Tiny
Cisticola, Southern Grosbeak Canary, and before the
sun had set we arrived at the base of the lava
cliff. Just after the sun had set, Richard played
tape of Freckled Nightjar, and was answered almost
immediately. I had always thought Freckled to be
fairly unresponsive until this night. A bird circled
us and flew back to sing from the cliff. We played
again, and it came in again and circled us.
Eventually it flew down to the sandy area by the
creek, where it was joined by a second bird. We
drove down and sat in the car, with the birds
sitting on the sand not too far away. We wanted to
try for some photographs, but it was proving
difficult, as by now it was quite dark, although a
full moon rising. We tried playing tape a little
further along the road, and a bird flew in and
disappeared although it was calling quite loudly.
Richard said he thought it had landed on the roof of
the car, I climbed out through the window, glancing
at the tree above me, where there was no sign of the
bird, then looked on the roof, and the bird was two
feet away, but naturally was a shocked as I was and
flew off. We played tape again, and the bird flew
straight in and just sat. calling five feet from the
car, where it remained challenging the invisible
interloper.

We left the birds and spotlighted along the road, by
now the moon was high and it was like daylight, and
the only birds we found were two Spotted Thick-knees
and four Slender-tailed Nightjars. 

Back at the bandas, the moonlight was encouraging
many birds to give voice, Buff-crested Bustards were
particularly noisy, Heuglin's Coursers were giving
their descending calls and the to date undocumented,
disjunct local population of Donaldson-Smith's
Nightjar (which are resident along the Magadi Road)
were also making their presence known. After a late
dinner we decided to try and locate the closest one.
Setting off just with mag-lites and no recording
equipment, nor photographic equipment, we headed in
the direction of the bird. After several periods of
bird calling  then periods of silence, we finally
located it sitting under a bush. We went closer, and
it sat there seemingly oblivious to us, we went
closer and closer, until we were at the closest
limit of the focus of the binoculars and nothing to
immortalise the experience! It sat there in all it's
beautiful spottiness, and we walked away still
leaving it in place, and when we were at a little
distance it started singing again (and continued
virtually all night!). On the way back we found a
Nyika Gecko next to the track, which was new for all
of us.

On Sunday morning there was much activity at the
bandas, the bird-bath was brimming with birds, a
good variety with Crimson-rumped Waxbills being the
most numerous species. All of the usual estrildids
were present, with exception of whydahs, with no
species present. The only unusual sighting here were
two Levaillant's Cuckoos. 

Stopping off at a lugga on the escarpment on the
return, we found four White Helmetshrikes including
one immature. We were going to climb the hill at
Kisamese to look for butterflies, and not
disappointed with two Hutchinson's Silver-Spots that
have to be seen to believe what stunning beauties
they are- unlike the dowdy illustration in Larsen.
However, we had parked in Ribs Village (just before
Kisamese), and on return found a pair of Bush Pipits
living in the garden. They were very tame, and took
no notice of the passing human traffic, or the
dogs.... and finally posed in a tree to be
immortally digitised. Anyone popping into Ribs for a
beverage or nyama choma, should keep an eye out for
these trusting birds. Never a dull day on the Magadi
Road.


Best to all

Brian
