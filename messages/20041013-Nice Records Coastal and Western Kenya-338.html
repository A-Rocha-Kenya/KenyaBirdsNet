Dear Birders,

I have just come back from a one week Bird Watching
Safari with Nigel Hacking from the UK, where we
recorded a few nice and interesting Species.

Our tour started at Lake Nakuru, which is wonderful at
the moment with a couple of migrants. One interesting
record was two Lesser Spotted Eagles; one in flight
and one had perched, mostly favoring the trees by the
mouth of Njoro River.

After here, off to Baringo, which is also wonderful at
the moment, with the Weavers coming into plumage now;
most of them being in a mottled plumage. The Cliffs
are super with Northern and Isabelline Wheatears, both
Cordon-bleus, Waxbills, Silverbills, a selection of
Weavers and Quelea all feeding on the Sorghum
plantations at the base of the Cliffs.

Here at the cliffs, I noticed a reasonable number of
Mouse-colored Penduline Tits and Yellow-bellied
Eremomelas than I have ever seen here before over my
years of working here.

We had a night Nightjars Spot watch at the Baringo
Airstrip and got a few confusing photographs. In the
morning, we did an extensive search of the Nightjars,
and saw a couple of Plain Nightjars, Star-spotted
Nightjars, Nubian Nightjars and the majority being the
Slender-tailed Nightjars. We also encountered a few
Juveniles making it more confusing.

I have a couple of Digital photographs that were
helping us identify them, and if there is any one who
is interested in looking at them, please email me
directly.

There are a lot of Mosquitoes in Baringo at the
moment, and it seems like the Nightjars are more
interested in feeding on the mosquitoes hence making
this time of the year one of the best time for
Nightjars here.
