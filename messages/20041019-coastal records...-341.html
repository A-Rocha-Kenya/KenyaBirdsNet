Just for the record... Eurasian Bee-eaters first recorded here a week ago on Sunday 
(10th) and then several flocks during the week - tho' was in Nbi at the end of the week 
and noted just how many more there were passing through there! 

At Sabaki on Saturday - 16th Oct - had an Isabelline Wheatear which is not common 
down here, more frequently they're Northern; the Black-headed Plovers are still present 
on the grassy areas just behind the dunes; Grippits (Grassland Pippits) are in 
abundance at present at Sabaki probably due to a load of grasshoppers that have 
emerged in the grass (checked quite a few of the pipits and all were Grippits, none 
were Malindi Pipits - 'Malippits'(!) which are often claimed from Sabaki. In fact I've only 
ever had one true Malippit at Sabaki in over 6 years of pretty regular birding there... 
beware bird guides taking clients there and claiming the species!!!). Sunday 17th had 
an adult male Euro Marsh Harrier over the dunes - seemed like he might have roosted 
there in fact - again not common for us down here. A small number of Collared Prats 
around still and had a pair of Peregrine cruise over calling and the male diving on the 
female, who would roll over the to breifly touch talons and back again - beautiful to 
watch - the two of them behaving somewhat as if they're breeding / starting to breed - 
but where around there? Cliffs at Ngomeni, maybe?? Also had a Red-necked Falcon 
cruise past at 1m altitude above the grass along beside the dunes hunting at dusk - 
awesome to watch! 

Going back a bit further, an adult Honey Buzzard low over Mwamba 3 weeks ago on 
the 2nd Oct was great to see.
