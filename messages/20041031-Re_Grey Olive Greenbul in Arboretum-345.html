Dear all
On Sat 30th Oct, That's yesterday, Alan Johnston and I
went for a morning birding in Arboretum between 7:40
till 10:00 am. The best of what we saw was the Grey
Olive Greenbuls and one had color rings that we were
able to read. A much smaller greenbul to those of
Arboretum with brown tail, pale brownish reddish eyes
with very pale tursus.

This individual was ringed in Oct 1999 as an adult
meaning he is over 5 years old. It was re-captured
last in Dec 2001. With no any or recent records of
sighting of this species in the Arboretum.

I can almost remember the individual being ringed, I
was new in birding and was learning the science of
ringing. 

It was just but wonderful watching them skulking
through the thickets of arboretum and to know they are
still surviving and still living 5km from the city
center despite the noisy arboretum, with people
praying loudly and in tongues in these thickets. 

I think something needs to be done about it. Praying
and singing is good for all of us but when done loudly
in such a small natural habitat then it's no good for
these shy, elusive forest species. 

good birding
