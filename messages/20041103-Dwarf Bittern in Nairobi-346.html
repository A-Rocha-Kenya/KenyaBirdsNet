Greetings birders

Nature Kenya's Wednesday Morning Birdwalk had another enjoyable morning at
"Proposed Biodiversity Park", the hillside with rocky outcrops and seasonal
wetlands near Uhuru Gardens and the Carnivore Restaurant, on 3 November 04.
The parched hillside was covered with a thin down of green with a scattering
of flowers, and a few pools held water.  Records include:

Dwarf Bittern flying up into an acacia, clearly seen by the whole group

Nesting:
Crowned Plover, sitting on two large eggs on black cotton soil
Gabar Goshawk, a pair guarding a nest with at least two downy chicks, in an
acacia
Little Bee-eater, several pairs entering holes in low bank across from
Carnivore entrance
Brubru, sitting on well-camouflaged nest in fork in acacia tree
White-browed Sparrow-Weaver, flying up into nest with food in its beak

Migrants:
Barn Swallow
Yellow Wagtail
Sprosser
Northern Wheatear
Spotted Flycatcher
Red-backed Shrike

Wishing you good birding,

Fleur
