Subject: Lake Jipe
Date: Thu, 9 Dec 2004 09:20:38 +0100 

Dear John, Itai 

Further to your interest in Lake Jipe, I have just
been informed that the
5km channel being dug back through the swamp to open
up the access to the
River Lumi has been just about completed, the water
is now flowing back into
Lake Jipe and the water levels are rising.      
Apparently there is fish in
plenty.   It would be interesting to see the
response amongst the bird
population.   When I was there in September, the
lake was 3/4  dry, the odd
Jacana were picking their way through the mud and
silt, lots of yellow bill
stork and some pelicans but not a sign of a pygmy
goose.   Fishing
activities were at rock bottom, tiny specimans were
being netted, the water
quality for drinking was appalling, it was taking 5
hours for a canoe crew
to negotiate their way across the lake through the
various channels (usually
takes 1 hour), animals were getting stuck in the mud
along the shore and
people were terrified of the elephants which were
coming out of the park
regularly.

If anyone has a chance to go down there and assess
the situation, I would be
interested in their report as I don't think I will
be able to get for a
while.
