Hi everyone, two interesting sightings for you.

Pat saw two Shy Albatros off Mombasa about 8 miles out on the 
20th November 2004. One was circling quite close to the boats, 
and then he saw the second one which he thinks was a juvenile.

Then on the 2nd December while fishing in the middle of the 
Pemba Channel between Kenya (shimoni) and Pemba, he had a 
Frigate Bird persistently trying to take the strip bait they had out. It 
must have been a great sight. Pat checked the Seabirds Book 
when he got back and thinks it must have been an immature 
Greater Frigate because it had white on its head and a white patch 
on the breast. We don't see them very often here, but it was during 
that time that we had that cyclone off Somalia so may have been 
blown off track a bit.

The other fun thing we have had recently is a Woolly-Necked Stork 
coming in to the bird bath and having a good drink. They used to 
come, but haven't done so for a couple of years and it is good to 
see them again, or rather, just the one stork.

Regards and a Happy Christmas and New Year to everyone.
