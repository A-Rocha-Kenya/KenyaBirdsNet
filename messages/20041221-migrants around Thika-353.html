Dear all,

I went down to Thika wedge ponds together with Brian,
to look for migrants (ducks, waders…)
On our way in we found few red-backed and Red-tailed
Shrikes. The swampy area on the way has been dried out
though there is still some water that supports
breeding Yellow-crowned Bishops.
Down at the ponds, not many ducks but few hundreds
Garganey’s and up to 10 Shovelers. The most
interesting wader around was 1 Temminck’s Stint.

We then continued to the big Swamp just down the
ponds. On the hills between the swamp and the ponds
and also on the hill beyond the swamp, Flappet Larks
were displaying. Down at the Swamp, Sedge and Reed
warblers were very vocal.

The most interesting bird though was one that we still
not sure about it’s identification.

A juvenile Snake Eagle that was flying low towards SW.
The underside had some rustic colouration on its body,
pale ‘windows on the underwings contrasting with black
‘fingers’. No bars on the underside except for some on
the tail and an inconspicuous grey trainling edge
(darker on the secondaries). 

The upperside looked very much like a Short-toed Snake
Eagle, with a very strong contrast between the uniform
pale cream wing coverts and darkish flight feathers, a
pale line over the wing (lighter tips to greater
coverts) and a darkish tail. The crown was very very
pale (almost white), again another feature of
Short-toed Snake Eagle.

We did not take any photo but I call all who has the
time, go try and get another look (if re-located) of
that bird as it seems very much like a Short-toed
Snake Eagle. 

Migration seems to pick up (I hope), go out and get
more records,
Itai
