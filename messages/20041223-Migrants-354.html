Mombasa bird walk on Dec 18th turned up a few migrants but they certainly seem to be in short supply. The exception being Barn Swallows of which there were hundreds swooping and dipping over  the ponds. The best sighting was aprox 10 Eurasian Bee-Eaters. Only one Common Sandpiper and it may be a resident. A flock of Yellow Wagtails passing over and a sole Common Rock Thrush briefly sighted as dusk fell was all. Have still to see my first Wheatear but live in hope. That's what the excitement of birding is all about. Wishing all Birdnet readers a Merry Birding Christmas and a Happy Birding New Year.
