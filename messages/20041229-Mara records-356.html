<br>Many migrants arrived with the current rains. Out on the plains, flocks of 
White and Abdim's Storks,&nbsp; Caspian Plovers and Yellow Wagtails. Both 
Montagu's and Pallid Harriers are very common and many Kori Bustards are 
displaying. Many Steppe Eagles and a couple of Lesser Spotted Eagles and 
Common Kestrels.
<br>
<br>The bush around Governors' Camp is alive with Blackcaps (singing!) with a 
few Willow and Olivaceous Warblers and several Irania.
<br>
<br>In the Musiara Swamp, Woolly-necked and Open-billed Storks and Spur-winged 
Geese are in residence.
<br>
<br>Breeding records: Cinnamon-chested Bee-eaters -&nbsp; 3 pairs using nest holes 
in the bank of the Mara River, Governors' Camp.
<br>Blue Flycatcher -&nbsp; several nests, Governors' Camp.
