Dear All,

I had the opportunity of spending two days in Mt.
Elgon National Park. I was not travelling with
birders, so the records are limited to a couple of
hours at Rongai Campsite in the mornings, and along
the road, right to the top of the roadhead.
Nevertheless it was very interesting, and a number
of good species were seen.

The road from the turn-off from the tarmac Kitale
Road is in excellent condition, and although dirt is
very smooth and takes only five to ten minutes to
the Park Entrance.

The Bandas were full, and the staff say that they
are becoming very popular now, and recommend that
any reservations should be directed at them, 
(<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:menp@swiftkenya.com">menp@swiftkenya.com</a>) and not KWS in Nairobi.

We only saw a couple of other campers during the two
days, but there were tourists taying at Mt. Elgon
Lodge, and daytrippers were coming in from Kitale.

The roads have been well maintained, although a
two-wheel drive might have problems getting up to
the alpine grassland.

The trails were remarkably birdy, although we were
not stopping on the way to the top, however in the
grassland we had three Montane  Francolins walking
towards us down the road, and I was so astonished at
having such good views of this species that I forgot
to photograph them.

We stayed in Rongai Campsite, beautifully located in
a grassy glade, with a river at the bottom. There
was a substantial amount of firewood already in
place, running water, cold showers, clean
long-drops, an open band-like grass-roofed kitchen
area, benches and table. But for birders the most
important would probably be the pair of extravert
Red-chested Owlets that leave the forest in the
evening to call noisily from the trees above the
kitchen. Their presence also makes birding much
easier because by imitating the calls the other
birds in the area come in to investigate. In the
short time in the campsite I recorded the following
species; AFRICAN BLACK DUCK. AFRICAN GOSHAWK.
EURASIAN BUZZARD. COMMON OLIVE PIGEON. DUSKY
TURTLE-DOVE. RED-EYED DOVE. BLUE-SPOTTED WOOD-DOVE.
TAMBOURINE DOVE. RED-FRONTED PARROT. ROSS'S TURACO.
HARTLAUB'S TURACO. RED-CHESTED OWLET. MONTANE
NIGHTJAR. SPECKLED MOUSEBIRD. CINNAMON-CHESTED
BEE-EATER. AFRICAN SCIMITARBILL. BLACK-AND-WHITE
CASQUED HORNBILL. GREY-THROATED BARBET.
YELLOW-SPOTTED BARBET. GOLDEN-RUMPED TINKERBIRD.
YELLOW-BILLED BARBET. FINE-BANDED WOODPECKER.
CARDINAL WOODPECKER. BARN SWALLOW. ANGOLA SWALLOW.
BLACK SAW-WING. GREY WAGTAIL. AFRICAN PIED WAGTAIL.
MOUNTAIN WAGTAIL. EURASIAN TREE PIPIT. GREY
CUCKOO-SHRIKE. AFRICAN BLACK CUCKOO-SHRIKE.
PURPLE-THROATED CUCKOO-SHRIKE. COMMON BULBUL.
YELLOW-WHISKERED GREENBUL. CABANIS GREENBUL.
NORTHERN PUFFBACK. BROWN-HEADED TCHAGRA. LUHDER'S
BUSH-SHRIKE. TROPICAL BOUBOU. GREY-WINGED
GROUND-ROBIN. CAPE ROBIN-CHAT. NORTHERN OLIVE
THRUSH. CHUBB'S CISTICOLA. BLACK-THROATED APALIS.
CHESTNUT-THROATED APALIS. GREY APALIS. GREY-BACKED
CAMAROPTERA. BROWN WOODLAND-WARBLER. WILLOW WARBLER.
BLACKCAP. WHITE-EYED SLATY FLYCATCHER. DUSKY
FLYCATCHER. SEMI-COLLARED FLYCATCHER. CHIN-SPOT
BATIS. BLACK-THROATED WATTLE-EYE. BLUE FLYCATCHER.
AFRICAN PARADISE-FLYCATCHER. WHITE-BREASTED TIT.
COLLARED SUNBIRD. OLIVE SUNBIRD. GREEN-THROATED
SUNBIRD. VARIABLE SUNBIRD. NORTHERN DOUBLE-COLLARED
SUNBIRD. AFRICAN YELLOW WHITE-EYE. STREAKY
SEEDEATER. THICK-BILLED SEEDEATER. GREY-HEADED
NEGRO-FINCH. YELLOW-BELLIED WAXBILL. BRONZE
MANNIKIN. BLACK-AND-WHITE MANAKIN. BAGLAFECHT
WEAVER. BROWN-CAPPED WEAVER. SHARPE'S STARLING.  and
MONTANE ORIOLE.

Additionally along the roads and up to the
moorlands, the following were recorded;

AUGUR BUZZARD. CROWNED EAGLE. LANNER FALCON. MONTANE
FRANCOLIN. SCALY FRANCOLIN. CRESTED GUINEAFOWL.
WHITE-HEADED WOOD-HOOPOE. PLAIN MARTIN. RED-RUMPED
SWALLOW. GRASSLAND PIPIT. DOHERTY'S BUSH-SHRIKE.
COMMON FISCAL. WHITE-STARRED ROBIN. RED-CAPPED
ROBIN-CHAT. STONECHAT. ALPINE CHAT. NORTHERN
ANTEATER CHAT. CINNAMON BRACKEN WARBLER. MOUNTAIN
YELLOW WARBLER. HUNTER'S CISTICOLA. CHIFFCHAFF.
GOLDEN-WINGED SUNBIRD. MALACHITE SUNBIRD.
GOLDEN-BREASTED BUNTING. YELLOW-CROWNED CANARY.
ABYSSINIAN CRIMSONWING. RED-CHEEKED CORDON-BLEU. and
 GREY-HEADED SPARROW.

KWS have constructed an electric fence, which is
having an effect on the poaching, however 700 metres
have already been stolen, and we can guess what that
would be used for.

On the down side, in the two days we saw no recent
evidence of Elephant, no dung anywhere, there were a
few Red Duiker along the roads, and small numbers of
Buffalo, Waterbuck and Bushbuck. Black-and-White
Colobus were numerous with slightly less Blue
Monkeys.

Mt. Elgon is certainly well worth spending some time
investigating, and at present there is a phenomenon
taking place that occurs about once every fifty
years, the bamboo has seeded, and is now dying from
the  higher altitudes downwards.  Surprisingly the
abundant seeds that must be underneath are not
particularly attracting large numbers of any bird
species.

Something that may be worth looking into, the Yellow
White-eyes on Mt. Elgon have broad white eye-rings,
getting on for Montane in size, rather than the
narrow eye-ring of more typical Yellow.

I have included a very bad photo with a typical
Yellow, and the difference is quite obvious.

Best for now 
Brian
