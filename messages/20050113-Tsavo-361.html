Dear All
Hello- just back from a quick trip through Tsavo East. We stayed at TDC.

Flocks of White Storks moving through feeding on grasshoppers that were
abundant on the Ndara Plains. Counted four individual flocks driving from
Buchuma up towards the Voi River. Flocks were approx. 32, 50, 78 and +100 in
size... This was on the 7th of Jan.

Lichtenstein's sandgrouse and black-faced very common along the roads and a
group of Temminck's Courser on the road on Taita Ranch on the night of the
7th.

Several sightings of Eastern Paradise Whydah in FULL breeding plumage- even
seen perching on telephone wires along the Voi-Buchuma road. Tsavo is green
and lush, with profuse flowers and groundcover - unusual for this time of
year.

Best
Dino
