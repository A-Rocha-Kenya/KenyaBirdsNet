Dear All

Brian Finch and I visited Limuru Ponds, Hippo Point (Lake Naivasha) and
Nakuru National Park over the weekend 12th/13th March and here are some of
our sightings.

We started at Limuru Ponds, where the water is low.  Nevertheless 1 male
Garganey and 1 male Macoa Duck were on view as well as 1 Temminck's stint.
The dry grassland areas had a number of Red-throated Pipits and Yellow
Wagtails.

We arrived at Hippo point mid morning, to find plenty of Curlew Sandpipers
and Black-tailed Godwits.  Of special interest however were 4 Temminck's
Stints and 2 Spotted Redshanks.  Brian got a superb photograph of a Temincks
Stint in front of a Little Stint, making a great ID comparison.  Several
Eurasian Marsh Harriers were still present, but perhaps the bird of the
location were 2 Great Crested Grebes.  Back in the Acacias, we were rewarded
with Brown Parisoma.

Onto Nakuru for a late afternoon and following morning watch.  The afternoon
produced 1 Dark-phased Dimorphic Egret and a few Black-headed Gulls amongst
a great many Grey headed.  The next morning at the Njoro River location, we
were able to establish the presence of at least 50 Black-headed Gulls, of
which only 4 were in breeding plumage.  Sticking with Palearctic migrants,
several Steppe Eagles were still present, as were 1 Common Buzzard, several
Marsh Harriers, 1 male Montague's Harrier, 2 Lesser Kestrels and 2-3 Black
Kites.  Of the ducks, 5 Garganey but over 500 Northern Shovelers (all on the
sewage ponds located at the Park's edge).  Of the Yellow Wagtails we
identified three Sub-species - Yellow-headed, Blue-headed and Grey-headed.

Returning to Birds of Prey, a Dark Chanting Goshawk was a first for Brian's
Nakuru list.  However the sighting of the weekend will possibly prove to be
an immature Barbary Falcon at the Njoro River location, perched in the
nearest acacias.  Brian was able to photograph the bird and the photos are
currently being scrutinised to ascertain if we can confirm the record.

Best regards

Nigel Hunter
