Greetings birders

Nature Kenya's Wednesday morning birdwalk had a great morning in the Nairobi
Arboretum on 30 March.  An excellent view of an Ayres' Hawk-Eagle perched in
a eucalyptus gave us an exciting start.

The highlight, however, was a pair of Montane White-eyes feeding a young
Eastern Honeybird.  "Birds of Africa" note that white-eyes are the most
frequent host of this brood parasite, but I had only seen the hosts feeding
the young honeybird once before.  The honeybird was begging with much
wing-shivering, and showing its white outer tail feathers.  We saw them next
to the path near the river just past the tree nursery.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
