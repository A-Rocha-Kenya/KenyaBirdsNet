Dear all,

Duncan Himes is back in Mombasa hence an immediate trip to Shimba Park in search of the elusive Uluguru Violet Backed Sunbird.

On arrival at Makadara picnic site we found it full of elephants and as they have undisputed right of occupancy we had to drive around until they decided to leave. We had already seen the most magnificent Martial Eagle eating breakfast, something with along tail but we could quite make out exactly what.

The site was full of bird sound. Green Headed Orioles were everywhere. Yellow Bellied Greenbuls, Green and White Headed Barbets, Turacos (many calling but not seen), Collared and Olive Sunbirds, Retz's Red Billed Shrikes (also seen in many places along the way), Green Tinker Bird calling, Red Billed and Trumpeter Hornbills flying around. The trip to Pengo Hill pegged up two Booted Eagles resting in a tree. On returning to Makadara a Crowned Eagle flew over displaying and calling. He then descended to land in a tree in full view. What an awe inspiring bird! There were large numbers of White fronted Bee-Eaters and Barn Swallows all along the way and good sightings on Crested Guineafowls. We also saw several Red Backed Shrikes. The most exciting sight to me was the giraffe with Red Billed Oxpeckers on its neck. I haven't seen Oxpeckers in Shimba for ages. This is not a complete list just some of the hi-lights. If you are in Mombasa I reccommend you get up early and visit this beautiful little park. The birds at the moment are great.

Needless to say the Uluguru Violet Backed Sunbird still remained elusive so another trip will have to be made!

Happy Birding Marlene Reid
