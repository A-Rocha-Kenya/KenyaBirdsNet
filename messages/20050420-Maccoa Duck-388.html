Hi everyone

Hope you guys have had / are having a decent rainy
season. Pretty mixed here, late in the north, patchy
in the centre and west but quite good in the south.

At a recent meeting in SA it became quite apparent
that this bird is the rarest duck in Africa with a
declining population of &gt; 10,000. In East Africa it
appears to be in real trouble (probaly&gt;300 in Tanzania
now) and even in SA the expansion of the past few
decades as slowed and there may even be a slow
decline.

We want to locate all sites this species has used / is
using. Please indicate if it is a wintering site or a
breeding location. Lat-Longs to allow us to
georeference sites within GIS maps, fresh or alkaline,
size estimate of site, any numbers / counts and their
dates and any references.

We know about the larger sites (at least those covered
by the annual waterbird counts) but information on
breeding sites, especially current ones, is patchy.

I recall Marsabit as a site but cannot find a ref ?
and does anyone know where and when with regard to the
ref to Turkana in Britton (1980).

many thanks

Neil Baker
