Greetings birders

The Nature Kenya outing to Olorgesailie Prehistoric Site on 23 April saw a
good turnout of birds and people.  Although the river was dry, Olorgesailie
was very green, the spiny grey bushes brightened with pink, blue and orange
flowers.

A small flock of Black-winged Plovers was walking in the grass a short
distance past Corner Baridi.

Uncommon birds at the Prehistoric site included a Black and white Cuckoo,
three Scaly Chatterers (in the dry riverbed) and a Mouse-coloured Penduline
Tit (near the river).

Northern migrants included Barn Swallows and Lesser Grey Shrike.

On the way back, at the turnoff with several signposts, a probable
Black-bellied Sunbird was briefly glimpsed.

With best wishes to all from Fleur
