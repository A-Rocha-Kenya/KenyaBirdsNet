A few interesting records from recent Nature Kenya outings:

The Sunday Birdwatch along the Magadi Road on 15 May saw hundreds of male
Chestnut Weavers building nests in the trees by the roadside. (It was at
exactly the same place that they were building last year ­ only to abandon
it a few days or weeks later.)  The birds seemed to be building in great
haste, with much calling and chattering.

Paradise, Straw-tailed, Steel-blue and Pin-tailed Whydahs were seen in full
plumage. The tiny water hole half a kilometre past the large waterhole was
alive with red fairy shrimp, copepods and other crustaceans of seasonal
pools.

The Wednesday Morning Birdwalk on 18 May visited the seasonal and permanent
wetlands just off the Sports Club road at the edge of Karura Forest. We were
immediately greeted by a Zanzibar Sombre Greenbul in full song, and a few
minutes later saw its mate with a beakful of nesting material.

In the stands of sedge, Typha and papyrus, there was a Little Bittern.

Wishing you good birding,  Fleur
