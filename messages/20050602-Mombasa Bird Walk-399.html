Mombasa Greetings to all birders

May bird walk was in new terrain at a farm near Mtwapa, just above Mtwapa Creek. The first excitement was a pair of Helmeted Guineafowl feeding on the shambas on the road to KARI. A first for the Mombasa bird walk and the first time I have seen this species so near to Mombasa. The farm itself had some excellent areas of thick scrub with some big trees. Within a few meteres we were seeing Peter's Twinspot, Yellowbill, Paradise Flycatcher, Red Capped and White-Browed Robin Chat, Violet Backed, Magpie (just a few) and Black Bellied Starlings, Yellow bellied Greenbul (ofcourse there were the usual dozens of Zanzibar Sombres calling and flashing around), Yellow Fronted Canary, and in the background the call of a Four Coloured Bushshrike.  We need to revisit early morning to see this. Higher up on the farm Green Pigeon could be seen by those with good eyesight. A few "lifers" for some walkers. Wishing you all Happy Birding.
