Dear All

The Lafarge bird survey (part of the "Greening" plans) is racing along with regular surveying of all Lafarge (Bamburi) areas including Haller Park and Vipingo. Kevin Mazera, James Mutua, Karim, Terra and Soloman are spending mornings and late afternoons covering all the territories. Last Momday 13th I joined them in Haller Park. In 3 hours we saw over 50 species including two magificent Narina's Trogons. A nest with two young Woolly Necked Storks, parents feeding in turns, kept us balancing on the edge of the cliff too long for comfort. Madagascar Squacco Herons were at the hippo  pond and the largest number of Black Throated Wattle Eyes I have ever seen. 

Sat 18th bird walk at the car track was pretty quiet except for the displaying Long Tail Fiscal Shrikes. There is so much water and healthy grass that the birds are very spread out. A solitary Wattled Starling (male in non-breeding dress) amongst a flock of Superb Starlings was a first for several of the group.  Ethiopian Swallows in fairly large numbers and a solitary Little Sparrow Hawk being mobbed by Lilac Breasted Rollers were the other interesting sightings. 

Wishing you all great birding as I take off for U.K. for the next two months.  Marlene Reid
