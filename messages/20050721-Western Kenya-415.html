Dear Birders
Hello- just back from a quick trip through Western Kenya.

Wolly-necked storks seem to have taken up permanent residence in the swamps
within the highland forest of the northwestern rift areas. There were a
couple of them in the swamp between Eldama Ravine and Chepkorio as well as
individuals in a number of other wetlands. I have seen them here every time
this year that I have been up to Eldoret.

Kakamega forest - Bar-tailed trogon flying across road from the Kapsabet
side into the forest, lots of Jameson's and Chestnut Wattle-Eye's, and a
Honey Buzzard which must be over-wintering as the Zimmermann book says they
are here October-April.

Large numbers of butterflies in the forest right now - hundreds sipping
salts by the streams and roadsides...

Good birding
Cheers
Dino
