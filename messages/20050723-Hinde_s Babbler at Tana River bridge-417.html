<br>
<br>Six noisy Hinde's Babblers at the Tana River bridge were the highlight of a most enjoyable Saturday outing organized by Catherine Ngarachu of Nature Kenya. Workmen were cutting the lantana bushes favoured by the Hinde's Babblers between the main road and the access road to the Tana power station, but suitable bushy habitat remained on the hillside.
<br>
<br>Later, next to Savage Wilderness white-water rafting site, we heard some kind of babblers calling from scrub and lantana bushes, but were unable to see them.
<br>
<br>Other nice birds at the Tana River bridge included four kingfishers – Giant, Pied, Pygmy and Grey-headed – Rufous Chatterers and an immature African Moustached Warbler.
<br>
<br>Wishing you good birding,
<br>
<br>Fleur
