<div class="moz-text-flowed">Hi all birders
<br>I just want to let you know that I have been out birding with mr. Wiel 
poelmans from Holland plus kamande a guide at museum. We went looking for 
the Hegulins Bustard and we managed to get about 6 of them on your way to 
Chalib desert about 8km from the marsabit town and again we drove about 40km 
north of Marsabit towards Moyale at Sigalugalu desert to look for the 
creseted Lark as well Thelak Lark which was productive and in plenty at 
about 18km from marsabit town they seemed to be alot on your way should you 
drive at snail speed.
<br>
<br>Early on we had spent a day at Nairobi National Park and we saw The Short 
Toed lark as well leaving here we headed to wanjee camp and it was again 
nice to see the Hinde's babbler carrying some food to undislosed site 
although the guide at the camp david told us he has been seeing it for the 
last one week at a designated farm carrying food to the nest which means 
they are breeding and actually understood that they breed during the cold 
season and this seems to be one of their great threat to survival.
<br>
<br>We later spent 2 days at samburu before heading to marsabit and here it was 
interesting to record the 2 palm nut vultures on the river banks and then 
one more on the road side as we headed to marsabit after a town by the name 
Leisamis.
<br>
<br>We also recorded Somalia Fiscal at Chalib Desert road.
<br>
<br>Enjoy you good birding times all
<br>
<br>Kind regards from
<br>Joseph Kariuki
