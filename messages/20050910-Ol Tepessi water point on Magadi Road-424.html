<div class="moz-text-flowed">Greetings birders
<br>
<br>Nature Kenya's Sunday Birdwatch visited Olorgesailie Prehistoric Site and Ol Tepessi Water Point in August, as you may have read in John Fox's column in the Sunday Nation. We had excellent views of Bare-eyed Thrush and Somali Golden-breasted Bunting.
<br>
<br>At the Water Point, we explained our presence when we arrived (we were quite a large group), and all seemed well. However, as we returned from a walk along the dry river bed, we were met by more of the community leaders. They objected to our visit without prior arrangement, and thought we might be taking photos. Well, we explained that we were only looking at birds through binoculars, and apologized for not informing the right people, and all was well again.
<br>
<br>However, bird-watching groups were requested to follow this procedure in future:
<br>
<br>1. On arrival at the water point, notify the person in charge of the water pump
<br>
<br>2. Be prepared to "bring a token" to thank the Ol Tepessi community "for looking after the birds"
<br>
<br>This is therefore to inform other birders that you may be requested to give a small parking donation at Ol Tepessi Water Point. It seems fair to me (we are using the road and facilities meant to benefit the community) as long as the fee is reasonable and goes to the community.
<br>
<br>As I write this, another idea occurs: It would be so great to have pictures of the most visible birds for visitors to the Prehistoric Site and the Ol Tepessi community!
<br>
<br>We could make a list of the 20 commonest birds; get digital photos of each bird; and print the photos, with their names, on a sheet of paper on a colour printer. Then donate a copy to each site.
<br>
<br>Any volunteers?
<br>
<br>With best wishes from Fleur
