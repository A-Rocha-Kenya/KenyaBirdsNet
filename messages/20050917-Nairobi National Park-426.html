<br>
<br>Last Sunday afternoon, 11 September 2005, we took a visitor to Nairobi National Park for a couple of hours. Wood and Common Sandpipers seemed to have just arrived at Hyena Dam, and some Barn Swallows flew over the grasslands. Two female or immature bustards with finely vermiculated feathers were taking a dust bath on the track nearby.
<br>
<br>Well, we also looked at mammals, since we had a visitor: a pride of ten lions, hundreds of zebras, a herd of wildebeest crossing the track, giraffes, baboons, and a variety of antelopes. Did someone say that there was nothing to see in Nairobi National Park?
<br>
<br>With good wishes from Fleur
