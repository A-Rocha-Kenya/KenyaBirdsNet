Hi everyone:

Just back from a two week research stint at Lake Naivasha. 
It was interesting to to go back to all my Augur Buzzard sites (done way back in 1995-1997) and surprisingly, some Augur Buzzard territories that were there then, have (get ready!!) DISAPPEARED!! I suspect there are many reasons for this, the main one being that their foraging grounds have been converted to flower fields. There is also a conspicuous lack of mole-rats (their principal diet) which could have resulted in birds just moving elsewhere. 

Not surprisingly, Augur Buzzards in good Acacia Woodlands near Mundui and Kinja Nurseries have remained stable over the last ten years. It was also good to observe 7 augur buzzards that were ringed way back in 1995 including a juvenile Augur Buzzard that is now a territory holding male in the same location where he was trapped (this justifies ringing studies).

Fish eagles seem to be doing well at Naivasha following the boom in the carp populations. A few resightings of birds trapped in 1997.

other raptors of interest:
- a juvenile Martial Eagle on Kedong Ranch;
- a long-legged Buzzard at Mundui
- a second year Lanner Falcon (ringed) at Mundui
- Ruppell's Vultures all nest building and incubating at Hell's Gate
- three Tawny Eagles feeding on the afterbirths of a Goat at Kedong ranch.

Very few other raptors around....


cheers,

Munir Virani
