hI all,
An overnight downpour on the north coast of mombasa
called for a swarm of dudus flitting about the
flambouyant trees, which invited a very large feeding
party..
Among the many birds feasting from this bountiful
treat were:
about 7(adults&amp;juv.) Eurasian Golden Orioles(EGO's)
Brown breasted barbets, Lesser Honeyguides(about 2),
and rather surprisingly, just a single black bellied
starling(otherwise seen in fairly large flocks), and
then of course the Common Drongo's and bulbuls...
And on a sad note, about a month and half ago, a
Juvenile Sooty Tern landed itself in our compound.. on
failing to be able to feed it,we informed KSPCA and
they came and collected the bird..on the following
day, i was informed that they had to put it to sleep
:o(

Happy Idd greetings to all,
Karim.
