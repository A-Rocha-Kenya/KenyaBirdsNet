Dear all,

i got this from Brian Finch:
Dear All,

I went into Nairobi Park with Jeffrey James from 6:30-11:15 am on 
Sunday 13th Nov. It was overcast and very mild the whole time that 
we were there. Migrants were in very short supply, although we only 
birded in the triangle Langata Gate-Kingfisher-Hyena Dam. We had two 
Hobbys, 2 Black Kites (migrans), 1 Pallid Harrier, 1 Common Buzzard, 
2 Steppe Eagles, 4 Common Snipe, 4 Green Sand, 1 Marsh Sand, 1 
Greenshank, 1 White Stork, 5 Barn Swallows, 3 Yellow Wagtails, 1 
Golden Oriole, 1 Red-tailed Shrike, 1 Spotted Flycatcher, 2 
Blackcap, 1 Garden Warbler, and a Sprossergale churring from cover 
near Ivory Burning Site. There were a few Afrotrops that were more 
interesting. An Af Water Rail was feeding in the open in the small 
swamp on the road to Kingfisher, Olmanyi Dam had a Fan-tailed 
Warbler, there was a Parasitic Weaver singing on a territory on the 
loop road from Hyena Dam, and a Black-bellied Bustard displaying in 
the same area. In a small Acacia along the road behind Hyena Dam 
near the Splash fenceline was a Red-throated Wryneck, this is a 
personal first inside the Park for me, and incredibly whilst I 
vaguely remember  the bird has been seen at Splash I can locate no 
record for the Park, anyone seen it inside NNP or is it (incredibly) 
new for the Park list? In Kisembe Forest was a male Crowned Eagle, 
this is the first I have seen in the Park for several years when 
they used to be a regular sight.

Best to All

Brian
