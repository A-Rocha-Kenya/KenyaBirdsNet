Subject: Nairobi National Park

Dear Itai-
I hope you are enjoying your holidays.
The following (worrying) news might be of interest
to Kenya birders &amp; their 
contacts:
Last night there was a fire in the north west of the
Nairobi National Park, 
though this morning (27th December) it seems to have
burnt/been put out.
Such a situation was bound to arise in the abscence
of controlled burning 
earlier in the year.
This further reduces the amount of grazing available
to the very large numbers 
of wild ungulates &amp; cattle now grazing in the park
(see 
<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.nairobiparklions.org">www.nairobiparklions.org</a> for details) in the very
dry conditions we are 
experiencing in Nairobi (&amp; still 3 months to go
before the rains!) 

More serious is the pollution of the
Mbagathi/Embakasi river -the one water 
source that can be relied upon to sustain the park
whatever the conditions.
Poisoned fish were reported 2 weeks ago. I spoke to
the Warden this morning 
after the rangers at Maasai Gate reported a mass
die-off of fish today.
His response? "Still awaiting lab results!"
At this rate the whole ecology of the river basin
will be poisoned, including 
the Finfoot &amp; the Pel's Owl we looked for! Not to
mention the thirsty mammals 
&amp; Maasai cattle!!!

Sadly this situation is reflection on the current
(in) ability ok KWS -a quick 
walk up the river would quickly identify the source
of what obviously toxic 
pollution upstream!

Best regards &amp; season's greetings,

Will
