this just came from Brian Finch

Dear All,
I spent Christmas in Tanzania, I was not on a bird
tour, but I think  some of the migrant records are
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
relevent to &gt; our own  region. 

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
On 24th December, there were Iranias scattered  in
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
open
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
situations in West Kilimanjaro and the lower parts
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
of Meru    &gt; immediately overlooking Amboseli. 
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
There was an Upcher’s Warbler at the entrance of
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Lake Manyara
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
NP in the same group of acacias that there was one
in, in early January 2005.
At the far end of Lake Manyara NP there is an
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
incredible place &gt; called the Tree Lodge, sitting on
the balcony literally
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
pressed against the west wall of the Rift Valley, I
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
found that &gt; I was seeing species that in Kenya are
very strictly eastern. &gt; Silvery-cheeked Hornbills,
three Eastern Bearded Scrub-Robins &gt; sitting on the
same branch in some strange group display, both &gt;
Grey-Olive and Yellow-bellied Greenbuls and Peter’s
Twinspots &gt; singing from the scrubby bushes.
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
After returning to Kenya, I went up to Naivasha for
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
a couple  &gt; of days on 4th and 5th January, ostensibly
to photograph
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Black-lored Babblers.
At 10-45 hrs I arrived at KWS Hippo Camp Site and
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
stayed until &gt; 18-30hrs.
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
The low level of the water, whilst rather alarming,
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
is proving &gt; a great attraction for the birds, and
there is a wide variety &gt; of thousands and thousands,
the whole lakeshore is teeming with
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
birdlife, and the habitat is extensive.
Huge numbers of White Pelicans, over a hundred
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Greater        &gt; Flamingos, plenty of African
Spoonbills, Glossy Ibis, Grey     &gt; Herons but
surprisingly few egrets.
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
In the wader line most common species that one would
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
expect   &gt; are there, however only 2 Black-tailed
Godwits, 2 Spotted
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Redshank but about 8 Temminck’s Stints. There are
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
over 60     &gt; Avocets, but only 6 or so Common
Pratincoles. Large numbers of &gt; Little Stints and
Ruffs, slightly less Curlew Sandpipers and  &gt; Marsh
Sandpipers, then smaller numbers of Ringed Plovers,
Wood &gt; and Common Sandpipers and Greenshank.
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Common Snipe are numerous, and feeding in the open
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
on the     &gt; foreshore.
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Terns are in large numbers Whiskered probably
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
slightly more   &gt; numerous that White-winged Black and
Gull-billed. All gulls
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
were Grey-headed except for one very pale and large
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Heuglin’s  &gt; Gull sitting on a hippos back. They seem
to be fairly regular &gt; at Naivasha nowadays. Whilst
walking across the tussocky      &gt; grassland I flushed
a dark, round-winged Snipe. Fortunately I &gt; managed to
photograph it sitting in the dry grass, and by     &gt;
persuing it very fortunately managed to get a flight  
       &gt; photograph, and it is what I suspected, an
African Snipe. This
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
is the first I have seen in the Rift. 
Several hundred Shoveler fed along the beach, but
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
only a very &gt; few Garganey and Pintail. Otherwise six
normal african ducks  &gt; were present.
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Amongst the migrant raptors, it was quiet, very
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
strangely and &gt; sadly no Ospreys all day. Four
Harriers of three species, one
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
callidus Peregrine, and the strangest being a
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
second-year     &gt; Greater Spotted Eagle which fed in
the papyrus. It was        &gt; digitised both perched
and in flight.
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Of the passerine migrants, there were six Red-tailed
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Shrikes, &gt; and one adult male Red-backed Shrike, this
is a late date for &gt; a bird in the Rift Valley as they
should be on the wintering  &gt; grounds by now, mainly
in the south of the continent. Three    &gt; Northern,
two Isabelline Wheatears, one Rock Thrush, all three &gt;
migrant Swallows, a few Olivaceous and Willow Warblers
in the &gt; acacias. Plenty of Yellow Wagtails, apart
from one lutea, all
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
those seen that had some trace of male plumage
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
strangely      &gt; appeared to be beema, with washed out
pale grey crowns and    &gt; prominent white supercilii.
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Somewhere in the late afternoon there was a Common
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Quail      &gt; calling, but probably just a resident
bird.
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I urge people to go up and see this spectacle, and
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
the wall to &gt; wall mammals that it is so nice to walk
amongst. It really is &gt; a very underated and
underwatched  KWS protected area.
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Next morning I looked at Naivasha Club, there were a
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
hoardes  &gt; of birds around the island, an Osprey was a
welcome sight,
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
and there were two Common Teal at the jetty. A walk
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
out       &gt; towards the Yacht Club revealed many
Olivaceous Warblers in    &gt; the fever trees, and a
surprise find was an Upcher’s Warbler  &gt; in stunted
acacias keeping within a couple of feet of the     &gt;
ground. I obtained a few photos of it, but it kept
much to    &gt; cover. I have not seen the species at
Naivasha before, and it
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
is a very late date for a bird still moving south. 
I then looked at Naivasha Sopa, an amazing
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
establishment, I   &gt; had not been there since it was
Safariland. The Pearl-spotted
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Owlets are still in residence, making it easier to
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
see what   &gt; small birds are in the acacias.
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
There was an immature Lesser Black-backed Gull on a
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
hippo, and &gt; a Swamphen in the water meadows run off
from Homegrown.       &gt; Neither of the two localities
had Black-tailed Godwit or      &gt; Spotted Redshank,
which was a surprise.
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
The conditions at Lake Naivasha are ripe for turning
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
up       &gt; something very unexpected.
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Best birding to all throughout 2006, and a very

happy new year,

Brian

I rather go birding...
