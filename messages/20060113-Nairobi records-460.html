Greetings to all

Nairobi city limits are shaped like a fish ­ the ventral fin is Nairobi
National Park, and the tail extends far to the northeast of the city centre.
Some records from these extremities in the last two weeks:

Nature Kenya's Wednesday Morning Birdwalk visited Nairobi National Park on
28 December 05. Highlights included:
Common Ostrich family with a dozen or so half-grown young, with long necks
like the parents but still fairly small.
Two good views of Martial Eagle soaring
Small groups of probable Lesser Kestrel in flight
A White-browed Robin-Chat singing at Hippo Pools

On a family visit to the Park on new year's day 2006, a flock of White
Storks flying down to roost in trees along the Athi River, between Hippo
Pools and Cheetah Gate.

In January the Wednesday birdwalks are combined with the annual African
Waterfowl Census organized by the Ornithology Department of the National
Museums of Kenya. At Dandora Oxygenation Ponds (in the "tail-end" of Nairobi
city) on 11 January, some highlights were:
A flock of over one thousand White-winged Terns, lining up neatly in two
rows on the railing of a spillway, then exploding into the sky.
One Collared (Common) Pratincole
Two White Wagtails 

Best wishes to all from Fleur
