Dear All,
I went into Nairobi Park today (15th January). It
was very hot and dry,
a few more dams are on their last legs now, Olmanyi
won’t last a week,
Ruai will be gone next, shortly followed by Eland
Hollow. 
On the road towards Eland Hollow Dam I found a Taita
Fiscal which was
photographed. It is listed as occurring in Nairobi
NP in William’s
National Parks Guide, the record is uncited, and
there has not been a
record since. Perhaps this is a drought refugee,
whilst clearly a Taita
Fiscal the back is the whitest I have ever seen, and
very little black
shows apart from primaries, and a very narrow
collar. I wonder if this
has come from farther afield than Magadi Road. I
have enclosed a photo
with this report.
There were some thirty Athi Short-toed Larks on the
East Gate road, and
a female Golden-winged Sunbird in the dry scrub
alongside the cement
factory,
Normally at this time of year one or two Isabelline
Wheatears might be
expected in the Park, but today I encountered close
to fifty, so there
must be many hundreds spread over the entire Park.
These may also have
been pushed in by the unfavourable conditions we are
experiencing. There
were eight Pied but no Northern, which is rather
strange. Red-tailed
Shrikes were also more plentiful than normal for the
time of year with
some twenty birds fairly spread over the entire
Park. 
The main focus is still Athi Dam, shrinking but will
be gone before the
long rains if there is nothing in the meantime. The
Common Teal is still
there, if not around the edge on the open mud, it
may be resting in the
shadow of the trees on the causeway. There are also
nine Shoveler.
Avocets have now increased to four and have been
joined by three
Black-winged Stilts. Migrant waders were 15 Ruff, 20
Little Stint, 3
Marsh Sandpipers, 7 Greenshank, and 2 Common
Sandpipers. Also there were
one imm White Pelican and one White Stork amongst
the numerous Marabous,
Sacred Ibis and African Spoonbills.
 
I have received a phone-call from Steven Easley who
is currently leading
a tour in the country. At Siana Springs in the Mara
he had a
Semi-collared Flycatcher, Icterine Warbler and
Irania, and at the Hippo
Pools (Mara River) today, six Little Ringed Plovers
together, and two
Temminck’s Stints.
 
Today (16th) another call this morning for a
breeding plumage
Brown-chested Lapwing amongst Black-wings on the
plains before Musiara
thornscrub and the descent to Musiara Swamp…. This
was his 1000th Kenya
bird!!!!
A second phone call in the evening was to say that
on the “Ahero” rice
fields on the road in from Kisii, they had 20
Pratincoles flying high,
and he could not see any chestnut under the wings
and is 90% that they
were Black-winged Pratincoles, there were two
Black-rumped Waxbills
there as well (they are often at this spot in spite
of how far east it
is), on the way into Kisumu a Rufous-bellied Heron
on one of the
roadside ponds.
