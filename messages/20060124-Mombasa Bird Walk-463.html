Greetings from Mombasa

Dec bird walk round one of the Bamburi quarries was not worth reporting with Common Drongo being the most prevelent bird.  Best sighting Yellow fronted Canaries 

Jan in the Huseini Car Track in Nguu Tatu yielded lots of migrants. Firstly several Northern Wheatears, males and females, a bird never seen last season although ardently searched for.  A Common Kestrel, Greenshank, Green Sandpiper, Red Tailed and Red Backed Shrikes (Red Tailed more prevelent), Spotted Flycatcher and hundreds and hundreds of Barn Swallows. Everywhere very dry but trees pretty green. Local special birds, Purple Heron, African Darter, Superb and Black Bellied Starlings (no Blue Earred), flock of Bee-eaters but not near enough to identify. My younger pairs of eyes thought Madagascar. Have some great birding everyone! Marlene Reid - Mombasa
