here is Brian's last roundup for January

Dear All,
I went to the eastern Mara this weekend with Richard
and Ann Bishop, to
try and find Karamoja Apalis for them. Stopping at
the wooded luggas
along the Keekerok Road we found a group of
Grey-headed Woodpeckers,
these birds have been split in Sinclair and Ryan,
one of the criteria
being the absence of barring on the flight feathers,
however these birds
were as barred as normal Grey Woodpecker but they do
have extensive red
patches on the belly. There were a number of Little
Weavers in the
canopy, the males being in breeding plumage. We
easily located the
original pair of Karamoja Apalis on the track to
Naibor Shompole Camp.
On the plains we found a White-tailed Lark, the
first that I had seen
that far east in the Mara. The bird was very
blackish above, and showing
a prominent pale panel the length of the primaries
and well marked
facial pattern. At Naibor Albie Venter (the Manager)
took us on a walk
to a nearby permanent spring. There were some
Rufous-chested Swallows
coming in to roost, and a couple of Southern
Grosbeak Canarys. In the
camp there was a female Golden-winged Sunbird
feeding on the bushes.
The next morning (Sunday) we incredibly relocated
the White-tailed Lark
in the same place, and had some twenty Athi
Short-toed Larks. We
relocated the Karamoja Apalis so that Albie could
get some photos (and
he got some incredible shots), then looked at the
“Buffy” Pipits. This
is an area that needs some work, the literature
states that there are
two races of Plain-backed Pipit in Kenya, goodsoni
and zenkeri. In this
area the two are side by side. The goodsoni looks
like an Isabelline
Wheatear  with the same upright stance, exactly the
same colour and
pattern but with a longer tail and uniform rump. It
sits only on the
ground, never on bushes. When it walks the breast is
exaggeratedly
thrust forward. The Plain-backed Pipit is dark above
and quite dark
below, the actions are wagtail-like and the bird
walks with the body
held more horizontally. Readily perches on bushes. I
have long thought
of the goodsoni as more like the southern Buffy
Pipit, as that is just
what they look like. In the area we had over twenty
Taita Fiscals they
are very numerous here. As we had had such an easy
time finding the
original Karamojas for Albie to photograph we
decided to spend the rest
of the early morning searching the drepanolobium
along the main road,
and after an hour of this finally located a second
pair of Karamoja
Apalis feeding quietly, some five kilometres from
the original site.
Such a relief to learn that there is not just the
one pair in Kenya!
Also in this area there were some ten Pangani
Longclaws which were
displaying as if ready to breed.
 
Zimmermann &amp; Turner and Stevenson &amp; Fanshawe were
unaware of these
western  populations of Athi Short-toed Lark,
Pangani Longclaw, Taita
Fiscal and Southern Grosbeak Canary and considered
them only east of the
Rift in Southern Kenya, but the populations of all
four species is
considerable in this strange part of the Mara
ecosystem.
 
Other rather unusual sightings were a Cape Robin
Chat in a dry lugga
along the main Keekerok road back towards Narok, an
adult Eastern
Chanting Goshawk ten kilometres west of Narok, being
a surprise find,
but perhaps the strangest was a Lesser Flamingo
standing in a dampish
basin in the Kedong Valley.
 
Last Sunday (22nd) I went into Nairobi Park, still
plenty of Isabelline
and now an increase in Pieds, but little else away
from the dams. Athi
Dam now had increased to five Avocets, [a further
increase to 7 on 1st
Feb], and a new arrival was a very attractive adult
White Wagtail.
Otherwise there were fewer waders and six Shoveler.
 
More news from Steven Easleys trip….. a White
Wagtail and Black Duck at
Eldoret Airport Dam, 3 White Wagtails Nakuru Sewage
Ponds, juvenile
Spotted Eagle Nakuru,  a Fox Kestrel at the base of
the western cliffs
of Nakuru (where the six long stayers were a few
years ago),  a
Beaudouin’s Snake Eagle at Madende Creek and what
was probably the same
bird seen at Sio River the same day, 6 Black Herons
at Naivasha Club,
Little Ringed Plover and White Wagtail at Ol
Bolossat (Nyahururu), and
between  500 and 1000 Yellow-crowed Bishops at Mwea
Rice finally  a
Gambaga Flycatcher at Baringo Cliffs.
 
Best to all for now
 
Brian
