Highlights of counts around Malindi and Watamu - all seasonal lakes totally dry so not 
much of interest there except Paradise Whydahs on 28th Jan at L. Chemchem which 
are the first I've seen around here (also seen the same day at Mida by Sunbird Tours 
who had a White Wagtail there at the same time). A Eurasian Roller at Chemchem as 
well which are not so common here. 

Otherwise... Skimmers have gone from Sabaki; a handful of Broad-billed Sandpipers 
only, many Curlew Sand, Little Stint, Ringed Plover as per usual. Not so many gulls and 
terns BUT a Lesser Black-backed with a colour ring (submitted to Ringing Scheme of 
EA to follow up details). A Lesser Grey Shrike at Sabaki was an early record for here. 
Probable African Reed Warbler singing in mangroves at Sabaki also of interest (we 
must try and trap and confirm the ID and race on this one...).

This year, for the first time, we had the chance to count waterbirds on the Tana River 
Delta (30-31st Jan) courtesy of the Tana River Camp. An AWESOME site to visit (and 
there are now beautiful community-run bandas you can stay in for relatively little one of 
which can be reached by car). 1000s of birds, probably 100,000s of Barn Swallows. 
Highlights for species were:

Common Kestrel - single female/first year overhead by Camp.
Pacific Golden Plover - two roosting on river bank
Caspian Plover - 4 roosting also on river bank
Spotted Redshank - single bird on mud flats and pools. My first for the coast.
Af Skimmer - a flock of 72 roosting at 25m range...
Single Sandwich Tern on beach near Tana River Camp
Alpine Swift - 2 birds
Barred Warbler - a first year bird coming to drink at the birdbath of the camp on 1st Feb. 

A great place to visit if you ever get the chance!
