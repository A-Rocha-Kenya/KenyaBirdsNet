Greetings

The regular outings sponsored by Nature Kenya have recorded an interesting
variety of birds each time, probably because birds are so desperate for
water during this terrible drought.

On 15 February we found that Grey-Olive Greenbuls are still resident in the
Arboretum.

By special permission arranged by Trevor Sankey, the Sunday Birdwatch
visited the UN compound, and recorded some 75 species in about four and half
hours, including a Black Stork.

Today's Wednesday morning birdwalk went to the Giraffe Centre, by courtesy
of AFEW, and the large group of birders were treated to superb views of a
Lemon Dove at the birdbath and bird feeder on the nature trail. A small
falcon with long narrow wings flew over us, and we noted a strong black
"strap" on the face and pale orange underparts.

On a family visit to Nairobi National Park on 11 February 2006, two family
groups of ostriches were seen. One group had four chicks about the size of
turkeys, but already with long necks. One chick was much smaller than the
other three. The second group had about eight half-grown young.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
