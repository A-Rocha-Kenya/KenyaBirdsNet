Dear Birders

Bird walk on Sat Feb. 18th was probably one of the most exciting Mombasa walks ever.  The area round Nguu Tatu is extremely dry and on the side we visited the small wetland area has not one drop of visible water. However the birds were more numerous than I have ever seen them.  At the first stop, a small pond heavily used for cattle feeding, we saw Common Sandpiper, White Throated Bee-Eater, Spotted Flycatcher and Carmine Bee-Eater and African Black Crake, as well as several more common species.  Driving from there to the ultimate destination we caught sight of a large bird of prey hunting low over the dry grass, a beautiful Immature Eurasian Marsh Harrier. He was totally obvlivious of us and flew up and down in front of us searching for prey. Overhead an adult of the same species was spotted. As we were watching, a Peregrine Falcon flew over, did a fast stoop down and disappeared, obviously catching prey.  When we finally arrived at our destination the bird life was amazing.  Hundred of Zanzibar Bishops, Ring Necked Doves, Namaqua Doves, Superb Starlings, Red Billed Quelea, Long Tailed Fiscal Shrikes, Bronze Mannikins, Golden Palm Weavers, Barn Swallows, African Palm Swifts etc All seemed to be feeding, on the ground and in the air probably on the the small moths that were flying around.  Most exciting species were Isabelline and Northern Wheatear, Blue Cheeked Bee-Eater, One Red Billed Buffalo Weaver (running around with the Superb Starlings), Common Rock Thrush, Common Kestrel, Whalberg's Eagle, Yellow Wagtail and Yellow Throated Longclaw. 

The birds of prey over Tudor Creek are also very exciting. A pair of Red Necked Falcons appear most days (and have done for the last 4 weeks) flying  very fast up and down the creek and plucking any hapless small bird from the air. Yesterday one of them was eating  prey while on the wing. The other evening prey was brought to my roof top to be consumed at dusk. Maybe a bat! The Osprey is very much in evidence. My usual Ayres Eagle, who seemed to have very tatty primaries when he first appeared 3 months ago, now appears much improved.  A moult maybe? He is only ever around during Oct-March and has been appearing all the 12 years I have lived here.  What is his life-span?  A Great Sparrow Hawk sits in the tall trees some mornings and the Little Sparrow hawk is ever present terrorising the small birds, landing on the grass last Sunday.  African Goshawk has his regular home in my neighbour's trees. Fish Eagles fly over most days and we must not forget the Wood Owl calling every evening.  The Eurasian Orioles seem to have disappeared northwards but there are still plenty of Barn Swallows feeding in the late afternoons.  What a wonderful birdlife we enjoy in Kenya!

 Wishing you all happy birding! Marlene Reid - Mombasa
