Hi all, 
   
  I would like to add on to Marlene's recent bird list of Nguu Tatu area(18th March), with a few other migrants that we spotted around there. On wednesday 22nd, i was with Micheal Ngala and Terer,birding in Nguuni Wildlife Sanctuary(Which some-what touches the border of the Husseini Dairy Farm), where we spotted: Common Snipe(1), Willow warbler(1), Red Tailed Shrike(2), Marsh Sandpiper(1). And a single Violet Backed Starling (it was wearing a rather dull-violet coat). We did spot Eurasian Golden Orioles (EGO's) and in fact, we have been seeing a good number around the north coast..(isnt that normal? since they tend to head further south (Oct-Dec), with some lingering along the passage route. and then head back north, towards march-april (closely timing the fruiting neem tree's))..
   
  Tip: Follow the Neem for EGO boost. Haha!
   
  But otherwise, it is very dry indeed, some of the ponds within the sanctuary have completely dried up too...the level of the pond where we had spoted the Little Bittern Last year June, has really dropped, and it was in this pond along the exposed banks that we saw the Snipe on wednesday.
   
  Happy birding all.
   
  Karim.
