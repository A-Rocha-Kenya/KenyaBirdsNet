Hi All,

I went up to Mutubio Gate, Aberdares over the
weekend with Richard and Anne Bishop. Our best
discovery was not a bird, but something that will
make visiting this part of the Aberdares, much more
restful in future.

Two weeks ago Outdoor Africa opened a camp-site, at
the foot of the last climb up to Mutubio Gate, only
a ten minute drive away. This is being managed by
Alnavaz Amlani and his wife Mora. We stopped for
Java House Coffee and delicious Cinnamon Cake, but
the menu is varied and also interesting. Good
English-type old country fair with such rarely
met-with items as Stinging-nettle Soup.

It is operated as a camp-site, either self or
catered. You can either bring your own camping
equipment or they have theirs for hire.

This site makes a trip to the moorlands now so much
more comfortable without the necessity of having to
drive a long distance before arriving. Olive Ibis is
now on the doorstep, being in the bamboo just up the
road. The Sharpe's Longclaw reserve only a short
distance away.

Reservations or further details can be made by
phoning 050-50246 (satellite fixed line) or Mobile

Back to birds..... Surprisingly no Chiffchaff were
heard singing, though one was heard calling at
Mutubio Gate, it seems that in January they sing
after completing their moult when they are very
obvious and quite numerous, then are quiet until
March before they depart. Numerous Jackson's
Francolins, Hill Chats and Aberdare Cisticolas were
seen. Nothing of interest in the bird line but we
did stumble on a Leopard right by the track, and a
most beautiful Red (Harvey's) Duiker in the Hagenia
forest. The recent rains had brought out a few
butterflies and flowers, though only one Gladiolus
watsonoides. We had a light shower as we left the
Aberdares, descending to Mweiga. Then we took the
Solio Road to Naro Moru. Swifts were feeding low
over the plains, amongst them a few Common and
excellent views of about six Pallid. This is the
time of year that they are usually in Nairobi which
suggests that they are passage migrants from some
southern wintering grounds, (though the species is
not on the Kenyan list as yet). Along the fenceline
there were some forty Isabelline Wheatears, twenty
Red-tailed Shrikes, and one Whinchat that had
presumably wintered in the area.  A Whitethroat
sitting on the fence was behaving quite atypically.
Numerous Montagu's Harriers with smaller numbers of
Pallid and Eurasian Marsh, about twenty Lesser and
two Common Kestrels (and one Greater). At night we
spotlighted two Dusky Nightjars, interestingly
sitting a couple of feet above the ground on
branches, not on the ground. Eight of the large grey
Golden Jackals, five Steinbok and twenty Cape
Hares.... It was rather disappointing, for the lack
of sleep-time lost that night!

The next morning we left the lodge (good local rate
10,000 Ksh for a triple on Dinner Bed and
Breakfast), to look for "Vepres" Black-lored
Babblers along the road up to Mt. Kenya NP entrance,
but only had to go a couple of kilometres before
finding a group. Of the Afro-tropicals possibly
displaced during the current drought, there were
fifteen Grey-headed Silverbills along the Solio
Road, and ten in the same place as the Babblers. The
Mweiga/Nyeri area has had substantial rain, the
shambas are green and healthy producing a lot of
food, and the cattle are fat and healthy, however on
reaching Karatina the climate is dry and there is no
water in the pond... after that it is all
drought-stricken on the way to Nairobi. Whilst we
were there Mt. Kenya was under thick black clouds
and was undeniably receiving a soaking.

Best birding 

Brian
