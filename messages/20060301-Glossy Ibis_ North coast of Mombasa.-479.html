Hi all,
   
  I was in Haller Park(north coast of msa) on the 17th Feb, though not on a bird watching visit, i managed to skip away from the people i was meeting with, to go and see what might be waiting for me at the Sally and Potty's pond. And thank God i did. There it was, just 1 Glossy Ibis along the edges of the pond. It was foraging with 3 sacred ibis'es..
  I went back the following day to look out for it, but no luck.
  Two days later, one of the guides sent word that he too had spotted it and so on finding time yesterday i went back and there it was again.
   
  I managed to take some pictures but they aren't of excellent quality, if incase anyone is interested?
   
  Karim.
