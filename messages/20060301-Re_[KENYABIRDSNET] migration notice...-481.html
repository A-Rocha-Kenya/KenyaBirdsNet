Dear Itai,

I¹m rather new to Kenyan birds and so I have been
quietly reading reports to
kenyabirds to learn more about the boundaries of
ranges and what is and what
is not common.  In the last few weeks I have found
several Black-collared
Apalis around Karen and Langata.  Maybe I have just
overlooked this species
in the past but it does also seem like they have
just appeared where before
they were absent. I would love to hear your or the
group¹s thoughts on this
nice little bird. Thanks in advance for any ideas.

I¹m off on safari for two weeks tomorrow, so
apologies for any delays
responding.

Cheers,

Dear James,

Black-collared Apalis is a bird of what left from the
forests around Nairobi. it is mentioned in Zimmerman
et al. as fairly common between 1600-2400 m, but it is
known from the Nairobi area (Ngong, Karen, Karatu,
Langata, Arboretum and even in the Park -Kisembe
Forest).

i believe that what you witness is a cause of the
sever drought. since the Gardens in Karen, Langata
area are being well treated than the drought 'skip'
them and they become a very big attraction (food wise)
to birds that are suffering from the drought in the
'natural' patches.

i am not sure what will the other members of the group
will think, but I'm sending this also to the group and
let's see what will it bring up!?

all the best,
Itai

I rather go birding...
