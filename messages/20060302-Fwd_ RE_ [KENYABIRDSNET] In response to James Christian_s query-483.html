In response to James Christian's query


Black collared Apalis appeared in our garden in
Karen (Nandi road), where
there is lots of cover, some years ago - although
they might have been there
before and we'd simply overlooked them as we were
not so keen on birding
then - you could trace them easily from their call -
very vocal  - and if
you moved quietly you could get quite close to them.
  We believe they bred
in the garden as at one time there was a family
party with young (2 I
think).   However, in the last year they seem to
have disappeared again.  
(We do not have a cat for obvious reasons, but of
late two or three
relatively well fed cats seem to have taken up part
time residence in the
garden - and we have been unable to get rid of them
- I sincerely hope they
are not the cause of the departure of the Apalis!)
