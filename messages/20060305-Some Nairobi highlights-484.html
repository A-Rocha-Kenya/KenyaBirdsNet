Greetings birders

Just as the drought really began to bite in Nairobi, the days became humid
as well as hot, clouds gathered, birds began to sing at 4 am instead of 6,
and since Tuesday Nairobi has had a downpour nearly every day or night.
The rain came thick and fast and much of it ran off, but quite a lot did
soak into the ground, and today Sunday there are pink rain lilies and green
blades of grass on the bare ground, and many of the city's Croton trees are
completely covered in hanging tassels of pale golden blossoms.

Highlights from a visit to Nairobi National Park on 4 March included:
An Ostrich family, with five young about two-thirds grown, two smaller ones
and one very small "runt of the litter", apparently doing well.
A Kori Bustard, an immature Martial Eagle, two Eurasian Rollers and several
Pied and Isabelline Wheatears.

On 5 March at the hillside with seasonal wetlands at the edge of Nairobi
National Park, Whinchat, Northern and Isabelline Wheatears and Yellow
Wagtails in spring plumage.

Wishing you good birding,

Fleur
