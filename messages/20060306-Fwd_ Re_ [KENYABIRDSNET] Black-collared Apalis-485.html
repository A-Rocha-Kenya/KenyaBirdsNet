Hi James,
With regards to Black-collared Apalis, we have
always had them in this
area. There are a number of pairs in the immediate
vicinity, they are a
prominent part of the dawn chorus especially after
rain, and well
adapted to garden life. Strangely whilst common in
the Mukoma Road
region of Langata, they are entirely absent from the
neighbouring
Nairobi National Park. The drought has had no effect
on numbers, though
they may be easier to see with the thinning of the
vegetation. Grey
Apalis resident in IUCN is also strangely absent
from the Park.
Best for now
Brian
My answer is at the bottom...

Dear James,
Black-collared Apalis is a bird of what left from
the
forests around Nairobi. it is mentioned in Zimmerman
et al. as fairly common between 1600-2400 m, but it
is
known from the Nairobi area (Ngong, Karen, Karatu,
Langata, Arboretum and even in the Park -Kisembe
Forest).
i believe that what you witness is a cause of the
sever drought. since the Gardens in Karen, Langata
area are being well treated than the drought 'skip'
them and they become a very big attraction (food
wise)
to birds that are suffering from the drought in the
'natural' patches.
i am not sure what will the other members of the
group
will think, but I'm sending this also to the group
and
let's see what will it bring up!?
all the best,
Itai
I rather go birding...
