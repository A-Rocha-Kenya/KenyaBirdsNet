Further to yesterday's communications.

Carefully nonchalant sms msg from JW, Anabel Harries
&amp; Frank Christopher on
'Lark Plains' - Wednesday morning, March 8, 2006. 

"Fox Kestrel catching giant dung beetles in flight,
magic!"
And those immediately subsequent cell phone
exchanges regarding the risk of
causing you cardio-vascular irregularity - herewith
please find Annabel's
excellent hand-held record shots of the bird and a
brief tale of a russet
tail.

We found the bird entirely by chance, how else?

Mid cloudy morning on the outermost outwash fan of
Mount Meru I had decided
that we should undertake what I felt sure would be a
'negative registration
transect' for Beesley's Lark in the northeast sector
of the Osugat plain. So
we set off from the northern track that crosses the
plain walking southwards
three abreast, spaniel at heel, in the general
direction of Momella.  As
anticipated there were very few larks of any species
on the eroded and
close-cropped tussock sward of this sector.  A
couple of post-cyclone rains
ubiquitous dun-coloured Athi Short-toed Larks
fluttered-up ahead of us, one
even rose heavenwards to provide some faltering
song, a very small number of
itinerant Fischer's Sparrow-larks (ca 10) were
tracking westward across our
path into the open plain. Nothing at all to compare
with the symphony of
five larks enjoyed only an hour earlier in the
western sector. 

After a few minutes trudge yields one male Montagu's
Harrier, two Temminck's
Coursers and two Common Kestrels I notice a falcon
shape rise from the
ground 200 metres or so directly ahead of us, fly
fast and low to the right
then body-twist to neatly catch something small in
mid-air. Up go the bins,
and awareness goes into that million year old,
adrenalin-fueled   'wild
image playback mode' that some of us just know and
love: flash memory
comparison. "Wing pattern like a Grasshopper Buzzard
, White-eyed Kestrel
body shape maybe, but that colour? Overall richer
than a Brahminy Kite and
that full paddle of a tail, it glows richly redder
than on any Red Kite."

After a conscious inhalation I knew that such a
slim, red and acrobatic
falcon here in Africa must surely be Fox Kestrel,
distant memories hazily
recollected from the Sudanese border of Ethiopia on
Christmas Day 1993.
However, we must completely eliminate the
possibility of White-eyed which,
there being an arguably resident pair on the plain,
is a tad more likely at
this spot.

We walked on toward the bird's position, it had
dropped into a broad 'furrow
of dead ground'. Gradually we got closer and Anabel
started taking some long
range record shots. The bird would not allow a close
approach but by
mingling into a large and fairly fast moving mass of
mammals; two hundred
piebald sheep, two Somali donkeys and two little
shepherd boys, who were all
closing from our right; heading in the same
direction straight toward the
kestrel - we were able to get a good bit closer and
Anabel secured a few
essential images. 

Over a period of perhaps one hour the bird mostly
perched on the sparsely
grassed ground, scanning attentively this way and
that, yet revealing little
more than head and shoulders. Intermittently it
would rise to fly on
'beautifully elasticized wings' low over the sward
before executing a neat
sideways flick to grab and dispatch a cruising dung
beetle. It would then
alight delicately on the ground and consume whatever
was required of the
beetle. 

Its incredibly rich colouration was a sight to
behold. In particular the
slightly graduated tail, the rump and mantle were a
glowing russet red in
the neutral light of that cloudy morning. At rest
the blackish primaries
contrasted very markedly with the rest of the bird.
We tried hard to
establish iris colour but could say only that they
appeared warmish,
definitely not white, maybe yellowish-brown. The
feet were yellow. In flight
the bird was always a joy to watch; the pale, almost
translucent, lightly
barred panel in the spread primaries was
conspicuous, especially pale when
seen from below or when the bird executed a sharp
turn to snatch a beetle.

After being chivvied along ahead of the grazing
sheep for some fifteen
minutes the bird began back-tracking, moving little
by little northwards
toward the main track.  Eventually it took off, rose
higher on deep downward
strokes the fifth or sixth of which was somehow
interrupted to give the
accelerating flight a very distinctive manner. After
achieving the desired
altitude or thermal position it circled buoyantly
into the now clearing sky.
It was then in company with two out of a group of
seven or so soaring Common
Kestrels who had been, somewhat clumsily, diving
earthwards to catch dung
beetles. When last seen it was drifting slowly
westwards at a height of
maybe 200 metres.

All in all: one of those absolutely superb breaks
that just make it all
worthwhile.
