Greeting birders

Birding on recent Nature Kenya outings has been very good, with long lists
and special species.

Today's Wednesday Morning Birdwalk at Splash (courtesy of the management)
was, however, outstanding. The grass and flowering Acacia robusta trees
(thanks to Najma Dharani's new Acacia book!) in the parking lot were
dripping with migrants such as Yellow Wagtail, Spotted Flycatcher, and
Marsh, Olivaceous, Barred and Willow Warblers.

The staff kindly opened the gate to the constructed wetlands, where Sedge
Warblers were singing and a Lanner Falcon swept over us several times.
Around noon, a few of us were lagging behind when most of the group was
leaving. Coming round a clump of reeds, we saw a fat little bird with an
abstract-art pattern crossing the pond on a strip of concrete. A crake!

It disappeared, but a few minutes later it was spotted again on the bank of
a ditch, preening. The small group of birders had clear views, in good light
and at close range, for more than five minutes. One birder carried Stevenson
and Fanshawe, and we were able to go through the details of the bird.

Yellow beak with bright orange base. Grey head with neat brown cap, brown
cheeks and brown eyes. Back with little black triangles. Rich brown wings
with many fine white markings. Barred lower flanks. Long green legs and
toes. And most characteristic, spotting all over the neck and chest. A
Spotted Crake!

Wishing you all good birding during this exciting season,

Fleur
