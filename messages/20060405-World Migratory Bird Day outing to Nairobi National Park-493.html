Greetings everyone

The African-European Migratory Waterbird Agreement and the Convention on
Migratory Species have declared April 9 as World Migratory Bird Day. Nature
Kenya celebrated a little early, with a special Wednesday Morning Birdwalk
to Nairobi National Park (during normal birdwalk hours, returning a little
late).

Nairobi National Park was very green, the white gladiolus in flower, and
there were still several mammals to be seen. Lots of birds, including these
Eurasian migrants:

Lesser Kestrel
Wood Sandpiper
Eurasian Bee-eater
Eurasian Roller
Barn Swallow
Whinchat 
Northern Wheatear
Common Rock Thrush
Willow Warbler
Red-backed Shrike (about 20)
Red-tailed Shrike
Lesser Grey Shrike (about 10)

The group also saw Yellow-throated, Rosy-breasted and Pangani Longclaws; and
White-winged, Red-collared and Jackson¹s Widowbird.

Wishing good a good World Migratory Bird Day,

Fleur
