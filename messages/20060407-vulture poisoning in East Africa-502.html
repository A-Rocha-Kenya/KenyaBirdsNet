Hi all:
 
Interesting to hear about the vulture poisoning at
Ruaha. Just to add that in April 2004, Simon collected
a total of 187 dead vultures (White-backed, Ruppell's
and Lappet-faced) as well as a few Tawny Eagles at his
Ranch in Athi River. This is the single largest number
of dead vultures poisoned anywhere. Worse still, right
in our back yard.
 
I believe Chege found a poisoned White-headed Vulture.
These poisoning cases continue under our noses and yet
nothing seems to be done about it. The South Africans
have a Posion Working Group and perhaps we could
borrow a leaf from their book to get some sort of East
African Poison Task Force going. Any thoughts?
 
cheers,
 
Munir

Hi all

 

We had our first (known to me) significant case of 
poisoning of vultures last year. I still await real
details but at least 80 birds (they will have been
mainly White-backed)died around a waterhole in the
Ruaha River within Ruaha NP after feeding on the
poisoned carcases of a Zebra and a Giraffe. An
agricultural poison was used.

 

ccing to Mr Lejora Chief Ecologist at TANAPA who may
have full details to share witth us.

Neil

Dear Paul

As Derek talks of the vultures poisoning in Uganda i
probably think this is the
same in kenya.

I know three case of such poisoning on the edge of
Masai Mara National Reserve,
that's at Olololoo Escarpment one case killing over 40
individual of vultures.
Two of the cases i heard from the locals which
proabaly means more unknown
cases.

All this cases were that the cattle/goat/sheep owners
were targeting leopards
after killing their animals. Asking if they thought
they got their target dead
they aren't sure they died.

May be Paul Kirui, a mara resident safari guide (I
know he is a vulture man)
could comments or have more accurate figure of cases
than mine. I copy this mail
to him hopefully he'll check


With Kind Regards 

chege kariuki
