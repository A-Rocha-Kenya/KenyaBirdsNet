Greetings

The Prehistory Club from the National Museum visited Ol Doinyo Sabuk
National Park on 8 April 2006, and we spent a little time at the gate. I
heard a two-note call that I did not recognize, and found an elegant-looking
flycatcher singing from a nearly leafless tree next to the KWS office.

The bird was blue-grey above and quite pale below, and I thought it must be
an Ashy Flycatcher. Then I had a view from the back and noted a black or
very dark tail. Back to the book!  The book indicated that the Lead-coloured
Flycatcher had a two-note call and a dark tail.

The bird had flown to forage in another clump of trees, and I managed to
find it again and saw it flick its tail, showing the white edging to the
dark tail. A Lead-coloured Flycatcher!

Other highlights of the outing were a pair of African Crowned Eagles doing
an aerobatic display high on the mountain, and Martial Eagle, Augur Buzzard,
Great Sparrowhawk and falcons in the sky; Willow Warblers feeding busily;
and Rüppell's Robin Chats singing beautifully.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
