Hi again,
Have just spent the past four days camping down the Magadi Road, and as I 
said in my last email, perhaps I should have gone lower. White-throated 
Bee-eaters are very common all through Olorgesaillie out to Emerit in the 
rift. There were no flocks, plenty of pairs and giving frequent displays, 
and many unattached birds. I walked along the rivers looking for signs of 
breeding but found none. The steep sandy walls of the seasonal rivers are up 
to twenty feet high and sheer in places, and would make ideal sites, but not 
only were the birds not active along the luggas, but there were no holes 
indicative of any past breeding. Sorry but we shall keep an eye on the area.
Best for now

Brian

PS Donaldson-smith's Nightjars are common and currently very noisy around 
Olorgesaillie and actually come up quite alot higher towards Nairobi. They 
seem to have been overlooked in the Kenyan literature, I was wondering if 
you have records from around Natron.

Hi all

this msg in from Brian Finch. it may well be that this isolated (by how far 
I wonder) population is a largely Tanzanian one that just creeps into 
Kenya.

Again, please keep an eye out for birds at colonies during the next few 
months.

Dear Neil and Liz,
I was down Magadi Road twice this week. Admittedly it was raining but I did
not encounter any White-throated Bee-eaters at all, though admittedly they
are usually a little lower than I was.
Although I am sure that there are bee-eaters present throughout the year I
really cannot swear to it. Personally I have never seen them breeding down
there, so again it may be right in the bottom near the Lake, rather than in
the birdier parts of the road.
Best for now
Brian
