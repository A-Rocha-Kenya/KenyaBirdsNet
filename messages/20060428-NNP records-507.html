Dear All,

Today (23rd) I went into Nairobi National Park with Richard and Ann 
Bishop.

After a misty start it gradually cleared, but we got drenched in the 
mid-afternoon when heavy rain descended and we were half-way along 
the Hippo Pool track, and then showers for the remainder of the day.

Migrant-wise, 27 Wood Sandpipers in a compact group at Athi Dam, and 
one Common Sandpiper there, one Greenshank at a roadside pool, is it 
for migrant waders. Three E Hobbies appeared after the showers, and 
they were the only migrant raptors. There was an Olivaceous Warbler 
at Kingfisher Picnic Site, a Willow Warbler at Langata Gate, two 
Sedge Warblers at Olmanyi Dam and a Whitethroat singing at Maasai 
Gate. Shrikes pretty pitiful with only one Lesser Grey, six Red-
backed and two Red-tailed. Otherwise a steady southerly passage of 
Barn Swallows throughout the day.

Of out home-grown birds, better observations were… at Maasai Gate 
inspite of the flood that has scoured the Mbagathi the Parks only 
pair of Red-faced Cisticolas still seem to be in residence. There 
were a pair of Brown Parisomas, probably the most reliable place in 
the Park for this species. Hildebrandt's Francolin were calling from 
the valley. At Hippo Pools there were four Violet Wood-Hoopoes in 
the car-park, but nothing else of note. Athi Dam's pair of Spur-
winged Plovers occupy their same territory. On the Causeway there 
were three active male Lesser Masked Weavers nesting in the acacias, 
and four Black-crowned Night-Herons roosting there, and a female 
Golden-winged Sunbird in an acacia mellifera there. Not too far from 
the Beacon was a Black-bellied Bustard, and Rosy-breasted Longclaws 
were unusually prominent scattered over the grassy plains. Near the 
Leopard Cliffs we found a single Capped Wheatear.

Finally we have just heard (thanks to Ben Mugambi) about Castle 
Forest….. I received this from a friend in SA who runs bird tours…. 
It came as a bit of a shock as I thought we knew our country 
reasonably well…… " I know Castle Forest and all our current groups 
stay there. Its absolutely awesome, all the birds are right there - 
Olive Ibis flying overhead, Mountain Nightjar on the chalet roofs, 
White-headed Woodhoopoe, Delegorgue's Pigeon and much besides right 
in the lodge gardens. The people are very nice and its not luxurious 
but the clients like it a lot."

Best birding 

Brian
