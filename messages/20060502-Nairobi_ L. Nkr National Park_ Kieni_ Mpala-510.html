Dear all
Hope you all enjoyed the holidays.
on 22nd april in Nairobi NP with Nigel and Jackie from
bto had 1 Broad-billed Roller (in fact my first one in
the park).
several migrant including
4 Red-backed Shrike
1 Red-tailed Shrike
1 Eurasian Oriole
2 Willow Warbler
1 Eurasian Hoopoe
afew Ruff at the Athi Dam

also 
White-tailed Lark doing the flight displaying, jackson
Widowbirds "poping" up and down, about five Pangani
Longclaws as well as numerous Rosy-breasted Longclaw. 
Violet-Wood Hoopoe at the Hippo Pool (probably the
same ones Brian and Bishop saw the following day)

Probably better to report a whole day in the park with
no single record of a Marabou Stork. They must be
choosy on what to feed on after the rains

Then at Lake Nakuru National Park on e African Thrush
near the Lion Hill Lodge on 23rd of April

Then during the Fundamentals of Ornithology Course run
by Nature Kenya, Ornithology Department of NMK, Arocha
Kenya and Tropical Biology Association, had one
Abysinian Ground Thrush at the Kieni Forest heard and
seen, a single Eurasina Hobby on 25th of April

one Horus Swift, Wahlsberg's Honeybird at Mpala Ranch
in Laikipia on 14th april.

16 Red-fronted Parrots and 2 Eurasian Hobby at Serena
Mountain Lodge on 17th of april
