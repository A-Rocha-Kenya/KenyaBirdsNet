Yes, Mangrove K'fishers definitely move with us here. None around until a couple of 
weeks ago and just the last 3 days we've caught four - two previous year retraps 
including one today ringed in July 02 and two new - only one of which was a juv. Fry et 
al talk of them being partial migrants vacating coastal sites in Sept / Oct and going 
inland to breed returning in Feb / March. Some appear to visit Zanzibar during this 
period away from the coast. Would be interested to hear from anyone with records of 
Mangrove Kingfisher during the period Sept - March to try and work out exactly where 
DO they go? In many ways, their appearance together with other migrants from further 
south suggests they have some sort of South-north movement, though I guess there's 
no real reason for it to be as such.

Fry et al also talk of them only occuring within c.20km of the coast (tho' then say they 
go to breed up to 50km inland..). on 1st Dec 2003 we caught and ringed a Full Adult at 
Ngulia which was VERY bizarre and must therefore be the most inland record for the 
species. 

Pygmys coming in in force this week too and we've caught about 8-9 so far. Still no 
Red-capped however (any ideas what might have delayed them??) - and very 
interesting what you say about when and where you've caught them in Tz. Clearly a 
LOT to find out about them. We certainly get our regular 'friends' returning every year to 
the same nets as previous years so they're faithful to sites this end.

Mad Bee-eaters have petered out a little. Was some constant and good movement 10 
days ago over 4-5 days. 

SGT was in the main forest at the 'usual' site near Gede forest station. Will be looking 
out for more (have had one at Mwamba in Oct 04 which was amazing...).

Always nice to catch s'thing unusual for the site you ring - we had an immature 
Common Scimitarbill yesterday which was the first I've even seen let alone catch right 
on the beach front. Doing its 'juvenile dispersal' bit, I guess given it was in pretty much 
total juv plumage except for c.15% adult body feathers.

Hi Colin

Did not realise Mangrove Kingfisher moved with you !!!

would love to hear about more SGTs than just one !! was this at Gede
or with you ?

Presumably your Pygmy Kingfishers are the southern race ? we caught
one moving at night at Mufindi last week, 6 Pittas, 5 Harlequin Quails
and an African Crake as well as a very late Marsh warbler that was
underweight and did not survive being held overnight by factory staff.

In all her years ringing at Mufindi Liz only ever caught 1 Red-capped
Robin and we only caught one moving at night in the East Usambars yet
they are common, almost abundant as migrants in the Pugu Hills both
March-April and Sept/oct.

Madagascar Bee-eater movements most confusing, would be good to have
dates, numbers directions from as many folk as possible. I'll send you
our latest map for this species.

cheers
