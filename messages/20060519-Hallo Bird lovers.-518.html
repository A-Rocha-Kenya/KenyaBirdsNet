I recently joined  the kenyabirdsnet group and i would like to share a bit of my exprience from the place i come from.

As i go on with my guiding business in and around mt.kenya National park, here is a check-list of some the birds i commonally encouter as i do the hiking, to mention but a few.
     
Forest zone:(2500m-3200m) we have the Olive Thrush, Hartlaub's Turaco, Golden-Winged Sunbird, Tropical Boubou (more heard than seen), Red Fronted Parrot, Red Necked Dove, Dusky Flycatcher, Cinnamon Bee-Eater, Green Pegion, Verreux's Eagle Owl, Hadada Ibis, Dusky Tuttle Dove.

Moorland zone:(3200m-4000m) we have the Jackson's Francolin, Augur Buzzard, Hunter Cistocola, Steaky Seed-eater, Scarlet-Tuffted Malachite Sunbird, Slender-billed Starling, Alpine Chat.

Rock Areas: Above 4200m we have the Alpine Chat, Augur Buzzard and also the black verreux's Eagle Which is very rare to see.

I wish you a successfull  birding and do enjoy yourself as you listen to the sound of birds over the weekend.

Thanks.
Regards,
Peter,
