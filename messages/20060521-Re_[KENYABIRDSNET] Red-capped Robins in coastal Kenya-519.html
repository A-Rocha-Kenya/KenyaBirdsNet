Thanks, Neil - all very interesting and useful. We've been without phone lines for 4 days 
since my last email but that same morning (tues 16th - I was emailing between opening 
nets and first round...) we caught two retraps (one from 2002, the other an 05 bird) and 
a first year bird still juv head plumage. from what I can remember, none of our birds, or 
very few, are in moult at all while they are here - I'll double check on that however.

Have only heard my first one here at my place along the beach from the centre today so 
it seems they're just trickling in. I'll have a look at our data to see what ratio of ads to 
young and MM to FF as well. Some nice work to be done here and certainly the 
possibility of a joint paper. Late rains would seem to be a good explanation for the late 
arrival of them - almost a month later than in some years.

Hi Colin

We have long suspected that these natalensis visitors to the coast
have a SW origin rather than a simple southern one from the coast but
of course have no idea how far they have travelled. I do recall a bird
on Kifufu incorporating East Coast Akalat song phrases so perhaps some
of your birds do not move far. We know they do not move in numbers
through Mufindi and are not common as nocturnal migrants in Amani.

One day I'll get around to analysing our 1100 + ringing records.Terry,
this would keep you busy for a few weeks !!!

Colin, what's your sample size now ? there should be a joint paper
here somewhere.

Rains were VERY late this year and these are rains breeders. Moult is
critical for these birds, they have to leave breeding grounds before
they become too dry and burn. Adult males begin moult when females are
on eggs.

It was always complicated in the Pugu Hills because we had a small
resident breeding population there as well as passage birds and
"winter" visitors.

1st arrivals would be adult males having completed moult on their
breeding grounds, 2nd batch would have the 1st young of the year and
remaining males, 3rd batch the last lot of imms and the 1st females,
4th batch would be the remaining females, the last of these would
still be moulting inner secondaries such is their "desire" to migrate.

Now, it was never quite as simple as this of course but that's the
general pattern.

In reality we could be taking about waves of birds from different sub
populations.

So.. I would guess that your birds are late because the rains were
late on the breeding grounds and they waited a few extra weeks before
breeding.  Sadly no one working in coastal Tanzania any longer.

I would be interested in the ratio of imms to adults this year and a
comparison with previous years, this might give you a feel for
breeding success this year.

Hope this helps

Neil

a few days ago asking where were all the Red-capped Robin Chats I
heard the first one during church on sunday in Malindi! Did a bit of
env. education and pointed it out to the congregation which amused and
interested them all!! Still haven't had them at Mwamba yet however -
but understand one or two have been recorded in Arabuko-Sokoke. It's
very late for them, all the same and would be interesting to know if
any Tanzanians who get this (Neil?) have any idea why they may have
delayed so much.
