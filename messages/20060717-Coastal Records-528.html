Dear Birders,

I have just finished guiding a short Kenyan Coast
safari- birding with David Andrew- Lonely Planet
Travel Writer. This was a good tour to visit the Coast
in such a time when we have the Malagasy migrants and
off course with the current occasional rains.

Our tour started at Malindi where we visited Sabaki
River Mouth on the evening of 9th July. As usual
Sabaki Goodies- (Birds in huge flocks); the tide was
down and at this time of the year it comes up very
fast. There were a couple of Madagascar Pratincoles
flying around, surprisingly a couple of Lesser and
Greater Crested Terns- I tend to think that in our
region these Terns  are around all the year round, as
I have seen them here nearly all months of the year???

There were also huge flocks of the other usual common
Terns, Gulls, Stints etc. However, good number of
ducks with Red-billed Teals, Fulvous and White-faced
Whistling ducks (good to see them both here) and
Knob-billed Ducks too. The pools opposite Sabaki Camp
and Cottage had a Dwarf Bitten, lots of frogs calling
by dusk and we also saw a Square- tailed Nightjar
flying around here too. This Nightjar had very clear
square-shaped tail with narrow white outer-tails and a
white trailing edge of the wing- we could not make up
of anything else. We had a Mongolian Sandplover- even
though in the Terry’s and Fanshawe book says we should
have them between September- April (another
possibility of species that do not migrate).

Lots of Eurasian Curlew’s were also recorded (one
flock of 11 feeding together)-never seen many together
like that here before: No migratory Sandpipers were
recorded apart from one Marsh Sandpiper. At the gate
of Sabaki Camp, we flashed a female Harlequin Quail.
Good news- Sabaki Camp and Cottage have got two new
luxury tents, but yet to be completed to be – full
ensuite,

Sokoke and Mida – just the usual local species-
nothing on highlight just the unusual abundance of
Sokoke Pipits in the forest. We saw two and at
different places and on several occasions heard others
calling. Worthy mentioning—Kararacha pools are
finished, they are now covered by tall grass and only
a 10ft by 15 ft size of water Lilly pool remains. The
forest has lots of fruits at the moment and hence an
amazing high number of Black- bellied Starlings. 

Most of the tracks are overgrown and elephant’s
destruction is ridiculous- yet no one to clear the
roads. With the increased entrance fee, sure KWS
should be able to clear the roads- at least to avoid
damaging our vehicles. I talked to them and hope
something will be done.

Off to Sagala Lodge- Ndara Ranch on the 11th July, and
just near Mariakani driving through Kilifi-Mariakani
road we recorded 3 Mosque Swallows.
At Sagala, we had a great evening walk a round the
compound with great records of the usual stuff around
here. At night tried a night game drive, which did not
materialize anything a part from one Scorpion! 

Next day we headed to Taita Hills and on arrival at
Ngangao Forest we met some Dutch researchers who were
doing Taita Thrush research. They are tagging these
birds with radio rings to be able to track them and
hence learn more about their feeding habits in the
forest-what an idea!

Here we easily recorded all the targets apart from the
Taita Apalis that just gave us a quick glimpse! Here
Yellow-woodland Warblers are incredibly abundant at
the moment. From here we continued heading to Lake
Jipe, approaching the lake with the road that branch
at 10km before you get toTaveta. This road has been
graded recently and hence a quick and smooth drive
down to the lake. Jipe is paradise at the moment with
nearly all the fresh water birds present in abundance.

Notable species were Greater Painted-snipes, one Dark
Morph-Little Egret, lots of Black Herons (doing what
they are supposed to be doing), a couple of
White-cheeked Terns, one Madagascar Squacco Heron and
lots of Purple herons. There were lots of Little Rush
Warblers too, but our desperate look for the Taveta –
Golden Weavers never succeeded, as they were not
there. Indeed, Lake Jipe should actually be voted the
best fresh water lake birding hotspot in East
Africa-better than Naivasha!!!.

Wishing you all a great birding.

Thanks,

Ben Mugambi.
