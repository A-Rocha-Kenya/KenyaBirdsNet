just got back from uk and saw your note . At the Junction near Dagoretti corner
, outside the front of the building there are at least  2 palm trees , into
which, at dusk, fly  many birds , say upto 50 or so and I  think they are
African Pied Wagtails. The Junction has only been open for 18 months or so ,
where were they before ?

Dear Heather and all

Yes, there have been other reports of large roosting groups of African Pied
Wagtails, especially in August and September, and sometimes right in the
Nairobi city centre or the industrial area.

Does anyone know whether such flocks are part of post-breeding dispersal of
the young ones?

Speaking of flocks, Nature Kenya¹s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk observed a
flock of Chestnut Weavers near a dam at Ruaka (at the junction of Limuru and
Banana Hill roads) on 13 September.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur

At least 50 African pied wagtails on the ground at the Uchumi Ngong Road
enclosed carpark around 6.30 last evening.  In the dim light it was
difficult to see if they were  adult or many immatures.      Is it usual
to get such numbers together?
