<html><div style='background-color:'><P>Dear all birder's</P>
<P>I am currently on a birding trip and would like to confirm that we have seen the Dwarf bitttern and Heuglins Courser in Samburu. The Bittern was at some water pools that are very close on the Samburu Game reserve side and very close to the river.just after the junction of going to Samburu Serena and as if you are heading to Larsens Tented Camp is where we got it.&nbsp;There were alot more of Somalia courser that we saw than I have ever seen in Buffalo springs about 60, white headed mouse birds were easy to get this time.</P>
<P>Meanwhile there&nbsp;are rains in samburu and due to this we saw few migrants. among them</P>
<P>Eurassian Hobby 2</P>
<P>Red Tailed Shirke</P>
<P>Red BacK Shrike&nbsp;</P>
<P>Eurassian cuckoo</P>
<P>BLack&nbsp; Cuckoo (5) flying around and making alot of noise.</P>
<P>Black and White cuckoo</P>
<P>Other species that are common but interesting to find were Somalia Bee-eater, Golden breasted Starling,Kori Bustard which is sometimes had to get in Samburu, Somalia Ostrich,Absynian Scimtarbill plus many more of samburu speciality.</P>
<P>We missed thing like the Golden pipit the we expect with this rains going on.</P>
<P>We anticipate to have more better species as the tour continues and with rains all around Kenya.</P>
<P>Wishing good birding all whereever you may be!!!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>with kind regards</P>
