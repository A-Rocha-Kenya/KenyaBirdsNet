Dear All,

There had been intermittent rain in the past few days, but nothing 
of any substance. The morning of the 10th November was overcast and 
miserable though dry. All dams still with receding water levels.

Migrants are still so poorly represented, even less palaearctic 
waders than the previous week, but nothing of any interest amongst 
them. In the migrant bird of prey line, just five individuals of 
five species, Montagu's and Eurasian Marsh Harriers, a dark-phase 
Booted Eagle, a nice perched immature Lesser Spotted Eagle near 
Impala Lookout, and a Northern Hobby.

Kisembe Forest had quite a number of Blackcaps and at least three 
Garden Warblers, three Eurasian Golden Orioles. Athi Dam one each of 
Yellow Wagtail and Red-throated Pipit, one Eurasian Tree Pipit at 
Impala Lookout where there was one Sprosser/Gale calling. Only two 
Barn Swallows all day!!!! 

For Afrotropicals there was a very nice mixed flock on the edge of 
Kisembe Forest which included a Brown-backed Woodpecker. There are 
now two territories of Nairobi Pipit in that area. The easiest to 
find is to go to 26A, then go back fifty metres towards Impala 
Lookout and they are in a clearing on the right side. The other site 
being just immediately past the Kisembe Forest road heading towards 
Impala Lookout on the western side of the forest.

There was nothing at Athi Dam, but the run-off swamp still has the 
female and two immature Saddle-billed Storks. Athi Dam has a single 
Avocet and Spur-winged Plover.

There were a pair of Lesser Striped Swallows at Impala Lookout, 
these are the first I have seen in Nairobi area for quite a while, 
have other people noted their absence September and October?

I recorded ten Cisticola species what with the resident pair of Red-
faced at Maasai Gate, the only ones in the Park.
Still plenty of Quail Finch and Zebra Waxbills around the swamps.

Tony Archer reported 20 Blue-cheeked Bee-eaters flying over his 
Langata garden on the evening of the 7th.

Best birding
Brian
