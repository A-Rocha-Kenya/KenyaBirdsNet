Dear Kenya birders,

On my first trip to the beautiful country Kenya, I pretty much gave 
up identifying small brown and grey birds, as there were so many 
beautiful birds to concentrate on.

Nevertheless, I took some photos of a bird, which I identified as a 
Cisiticola – but what species? I have tried the bird guides and 
asked a Danish friend, who is more familiar with Kenyan birds than I 
am, but I am not sure of its identity.

If someone could help, I would be really happy and gratefull.

The pictures can be found on my homepage <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.piphansen.dk">www.piphansen.dk</a> 

 

Good birding,

Lars Vilhelm Hansen
