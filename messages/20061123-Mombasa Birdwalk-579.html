<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Nguu Tatu had at last emerged from the mist and 
rain and even the ground was dry enough to walk on and stay 
upright.&nbsp;&nbsp;Absence of &nbsp;birdsong together with the thick vegetation 
made spotting extremely difficult.&nbsp; The ponds are so full that beach areas 
for waders are non-existent although we did manage to see a couple of Common 
Sandpipers.&nbsp; Migrants not in evidence except at the end of the walk when a 
large flock of Barn Swallows came in to drink.&nbsp; This is the largest group 
seen so far.&nbsp; We have previously only seen one or two. The special birds of 
the day apart from the Malachite Kingfisher which we always see but which always 
remains special were Black Shouldered Kite and a very good view of a Black 
Breasted Snake Eagle. Total number down on the usual count with hardly any water 
birds at all.&nbsp; The reason for this is probably the fact that there is 
"water, water everywhere".&nbsp; One interesting warbler calling at the pond 
from deep inside the reeds but neither Kelvin nor myself were able to identify 
it and as my recorder was stolen some time ago.....Keep birding - Marlene Reid -
