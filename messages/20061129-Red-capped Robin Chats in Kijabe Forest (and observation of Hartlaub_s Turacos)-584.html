<div class="moz-text-flowed">Greetings,
<br>
<br>I recently caught &amp; ringed 2 Red-capped Robin-chats in the forest below 
Kijabe. I saw one last year at the same place in October. Does anyone know 
if perhaps they stay in the Kikuyu Escarpment forests year-round??
<br>
<br>Also, around 5:15-5:30 pm I saw for the first time quite a large gathering 
of Hartlaub's Turacos. I lost count after seeing at least 20 and they were 
all moving up the forest, presumably to roost together? It was kind of like 
"follow the leader", where the birds flew from tree to tree, one after 
another. If this is normal for this species then I was just not aware as 
I've only seen 3-4 together at one time.
