Dear All,

I have just returned from a 30 Day rather intensive birding safari, 
eighteen days of which were spent in Kenya. 

Before we commenced the trip in Tanzania we had a short excursion 
down the Magadi Road finding an extravert Pringle's Puffback near 
the Icross Road, plus the usual with Little Rock Thrush at both 
Corner Baridi and the steep descent above Ol Kejo River.

We returned from Tanzania through Lunga Lunga on the 11th February. 

The following day (12th) our first port of call being Mida Creek 
where there was no high tide with the state of the moon. Nothing out 
of the ordinary was found, and we failed to find Malindi Pipit at 
Gongoni with the continued increase in settlement. At Sabaki River 
Mouth there was an adult White-capped Noddy with the tern flocks 
which seemed very low for the time of year, and Heuglin's Gulls were 
way outnumbering Lesser Black-backs, there seems to be an abundance 
shift taking place, and it would be interesting to note if the same 
is happening in coastal Tz. On the fields were two Black-headed and 
nine Senegal Plovers. 

On the 13th we spent the entire day in Arabuko-Sokoke Forest. 
Interestingly African Golden Orioles were already back in small 
numbers around the Forestry Station, I wonder where they have come 
from so early. It was quite quiet as birds had already bred but 
Thick-billed Cuckoo was performing as was an African Broadbill.

The 14th we travelled the road from Malindi to Sala Gate (Tsavo 
East) which is in good condition currently.

The next morning (15th) we located an obliging Red-naped Bush-Shrike 
near Maungu, then left for Ngangao Forest in the Taitas, it was 
quite verdant, but again silent as breeding was either well under 
way or finished. I was surprised not to hear any Chiffchaffs 
singing. On the Tsavo East Gate road in Mtito Andei were some 
fifteen Madagascar Bee-eaters in full breeding dress, certainly 
breeding locally.

The following morning (16th) there was nothing much of note in 
Nairobi Park, a family party of four Nairobi Pipits were in a glade 
in the Kisembe Forest, Broad-tailed Warbler was displaying well 
below Impala Lookout. Otherwise there were no numbers of migrants, 
raptors or waterbirds.

On the 17th we were in the Mara, the inordinate amount of recent 
rains made going very difficult, from Trans Mara were not able to 
reach Musiara, although did pick up a Rufous-bellied Heron along the 
road past Mara Serena. Rock-loving Cisticolas were feeding young in 
the nest on top of Oloololo Escarpment above Kichwa Tembo, the 
woodlands were very quiet in the Sabaringo Valley as was the savanna 
scrub on the top. So little was calling in spite of the beautiful 
mornings. A Long-tailed Cormorant on a floodwater was the first that 
I had ever personally recorded from the Mara!!!!!

On the 18th we drove back to Thika, stopping at Naregei Ngare where 
there were two Maccoa Ducks, and Limuru where there were five Maccoa 
Ducks and better numbers of White-backed on the main pond, however 
the only palaearctic ducks were Garganey. On the sewage ponds there 
was an African Hobby flying around, the first I have ever 
encountered anywhere near Nairobi.

Blue Posts at Thika on the 19th was disappointing, a lone Grey-olive 
Greenbul fed in some exposed roots on the riverbank and a pair of 
Brown-hooded Kingfishers were present. The settling ponds were 
equally disappointing hardly anything, 75 Garganey, represented the 
only palaearctic ducks, a single Little Ringed Plover was the only 
wader of any note, but there were some three-hundred White-winged 
Black Terns unusually high number for here. Mwea Rice Scheme is a 
nightmare with billows of dust rising from the new road reparitions. 
There were small numbers of Yellow-crowned Bishops, but very very 
low numbers of waders and waterbirds. Castle Forest in the evening 
was it's usual interesting self. Barred Long-tailed Cuckoo was 
singing, and amongst the more normal montane birds were a pair of 
Abbott's Starlings. A group of Scarce Swifts were flying around a 
large isolated tree at the lodge at dusk as if wanting to roost 
there.

After the morning at Castle Forest on the 20th we departed for 
Samburu. At the petrol station above the Isiolo Junction there was a 
Chiffchaff in song, and Common Quail were calling from the pasture.

We spent the entire day in Samburu/Buffalo Springs Game Reserves on 
the 21st, more interesting birds included a Palm-nut Vulture along 
the river, Ethiopian Swallows around the bridge, a sprinkling of 
migrants including Iranias, Barred Warblers and an Olive-Tree 
Warbler. The place was exceedingly quiet with very little 
vocalisation making finding the birds very difficult.

The next morning (21st) we went across to Shaba Game Reserve. There 
were some six William's Larks in their usual haunt, but no sign of 
Masked. Chestnut-crowned Sparrowlarks were in small groups along the 
road. A smattering of migrants included an Upcher's Warbler and 
there were flocks of Common Swifts and House Martins over the lava 
plain. An Egyptian Vulture was something of what has become a rare 
sight in recent years. From here we left for Naro Moru with a few 
Lesser Kestrels, Harriers and Whinchats along the Solio Road but 
nothing of note. Long-tailed and Jackson's Widowbirds were in 
breeding dress.

On the morning of the 22nd we found a pair of Brown-backed 
Woodpeckers in the grounds of Naro Moru River Lodge, the first I 
have ever seen there. Brown-backed Scrub-Robins were singing from 
scrub on the other side of the river, and the land cleared for the 
golf course continues to be reclaimed by rank grass and small shrubs.

The offspring of the pair of Mackinder's Owls was on the rock face 
of the quarry at Mweiga and Nyanza Swifts were breeding there. From 
here we took the Ark Gate to cross the Aberdares, exiting at 
Mutubio, the road being in excellent condition. A delightful Four-
striped Grass Mouse was being fed at the gate with an assortment of 
local birds. The usual montane species were found but nothing out of 
the ordinary. 

On the Kinangop Grasslands three pairs of Sharpe's Longclaws were 
found in a small area, with one pair (and maybe the others) feeding 
young in the nest. Angola Swallows were in small numbers around the 
buildings of North Kinangop.

On the 23rd Nakuru National Park was a major disappointment, nothing 
much calling. Barely a dozen waders along the foreshore, and nothing 
of note. Flamingos in good numbers but other waterbirds absent, only 
ten White Pelicans! The settling ponds were also a major set-back, 
only six Garganey and three Shoveler, hardly any African Ducks 
present. The bird of the trip was here though, with a huge Saker 
Falcon lumbering around the ponds making passes at smaller 
Hamerkops. It was digitised though remained at a distance for much 
of the time. We left here for Baringo, the lakeshore was 
unattainable being inundated, and the recent floods having spread 
the Prosopis all along the edge. Waterbirds have vacated, although 
there is a thriving Cattle Egret colony in cover that may also have 
breeding Squacco Herons as well, and a single Black Heron was 
hanging around. Weavers and the two Bishops were very active.

On the morning of the 25th we found a Basra Reed Warbler along the 
jetty, it was singing, a formless chatter which I had only heard 
once before from a bird that wintered once at the Hippo Pools in 
Nairobi NP. On the escarpment was a male Irania which excited 
Francis our very enthusiastic local guide, as he had never seen one 
before. In the Kerio we found the usual specialities with the Green-
backed Eremomelas, Black-headed Batis and Chestnut-crowned Sparrow-
Weavers on the slopes, and White-crested Turaco, Levaillant's 
Cuckoo, Double-toothed Barbet and Lead-coloured Flycatcher in the 
valley bottom. 

We spent the entire day in Kakamega Forest on the 26th, as with all 
other forest areas birds were not vocalising to any great extent. Of 
the less common species there were two pairs of Crested Guineafowl 
and a Scaly Francolin on the road, Chapin's Flycatcher pair at the 
Ikuywa River, Yellow-bellied Wattle-eye along the main road, both 
Grey-chested Illadopsis and Toro Olive Greenbuls were more 
widespread and noisier than usual. Otherwise it was much as would be 
expected, with no migrants at all in the forest edge which was a 
surprise (except for Grey Wagtails of course).

On the morning of 27th we found three White-collared Pratincoles at 
the Mumias Bridge, and three Blue-breasted Bee-eaters have returned 
to a reedy bottom at Nambale. Marsh Widowbirds were singing though 
in non-breeding dress and birds were again very quiet. Good news is 
that the locals are protecting the remaining scrub along the river 
at Nambale to conserve the de Brazza's Monkeys there. We crossed the 
border into Uganda at Busia and on the roadside between here and 
Tororo had three Abyssinian Ground Hornbills. They used to be at the 
Alupe Hospital but disappeared, with them so close there is a hope 
that they might return there at some time in the future, although 
suitable land for them is disappearing at a fast rate. 

In summary the rains have played havoc with waterbirds, herons have 
just vanished throughout the country, african ducks have become 
equally elusive but strangely so have the palearctic species and 
waders have never been so poorly represented. The rains have also 
brought extensive breeding, making birding difficult with so little 
vocalising in forest and scrub alike. The paucity of palaearctic 
migrants from the end of last year still reflects and many must have 
stopped further north having found conditions suitable. The recent 
rains would have been thought to have been productive for 
butterflies but such is not the case, Kakamega is the poorest I have 
ever known it, Sokoke has many common species but none of the more 
exciting, the Busia Grasslands were dead whereas there is normally 
great variety…. and the same applies to Amani in Tanzania and Mabira 
in Uganda, only Nairobi seems to be experiencing a good bloom.

This morning (6th) I found a nest of Montane Nightjar with two well 
grown young, in IUCN.

Best to all 

Brian
