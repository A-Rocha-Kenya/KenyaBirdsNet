<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>After being in the frozen (but sunny) north it was 
good to be birding in the sun again at the Huseini car track in Nguu Tatu.&nbsp; 
Everthing very dry with a lot of burned off grass.&nbsp;This month and next we 
would be expecting to see migrants preparing to leave but as so very few ever 
arrived they were few and far between. Car track had been re-graded so walking 
was somewhat easier.&nbsp;Fine Red-backed and Red-tailed&nbsp;Shrikes in bright 
breeding dress, a few Spotted Flycatchers, a lone Common Sandpiper (which I 
suspect is there all year round), very few Barn Swallows and a Common Rock 
Thrush were the sum total of migrants. Local species of note, the now resident 
Black Chested Snake Eagle and the Black Souldered Kite, some lovely Pangani 
Longclaws singing loudly, a pair of Mosque Swallows and a Slender Tailed 
Nightjar taking off from under our feet.&nbsp; The lack of waders this season is 
unprecedented during all my years of birding at the coast. Even on my beach 
walks I have not seen large numbers. Saw more In Northern Ireland, lots of 
Turnstones, Oyster Catchers, Sanderlings and a lone Redshank but very glad I 
don't have to lead bird walks there.&nbsp; Keep on birding. Join us any time you 
are in Mombasa. (Marlene Reid)</FONT></DIV></BODY></HTML>
