Dear All,
 
I spent two night and a day in Mwea Game Reserve about 2 years  ago...mostly 
looking for monkeys and galagos.  As expected, Sykes's,  vervets and baboons 
there...and the place looked like it should hold at least  Garnett's Greater 
Galago and Senegal Bushbaby...but, to our great surprise, no  bushbabies were 
heard or seen.  Hard to figure.  Mwea deserves more  attention and more 
visitors...especially given its proximity to Nairobi.   Go camp there for one or two 
nights....and do your birding.  You will  likely have the place to yourselves.  
Please take time to listen and  look for galagos.  If you find any, please 
let me know!
 
Best wishes,
 
Tom

Dear All, 
This Sunday I went with Mike Davidson and Fleur Ng'Weno to Mwea Game  
Reserve. 
We left Nairobi Museum and 7:45 am, and left via Thika. 
Travelling down the Thika Road towards Mwingi, we had a Lizard Buzzard on  
the telephone wires at 50km from the Thika Road Junction, and the next stop  was 
at 70km. Here we birded for about an hour in dense scrub, with open ground  
with scattered trees and small seasonal swamps. There were a few interesting  
observations, the oddest being an adult Black-capped Social Weaver in a colony  
of Grey-headed Social Weaver. The Grey-headeds never showed any aggression to 
 the Black-headed, which was sitting around their nests with grass in its 
bill.  Unfortunately we did not have time to stay with the bird to see if it had 
its  own nest or a mate, but this record is way west of the normal 
distribution for  the species. There were two other birds that were farther west than 
expected,  Fischer's Starlings were fairly common, and there were also 
Brown-tailed  Apalis. Other nice birds included Bare-eyed Thrush, Tiny Cisticola, four  
extravert African Penduline-Tits, Grey-headed Silverbill, Straw-tailed Whydahs 
 and Southern Grosbeak Canarys.
