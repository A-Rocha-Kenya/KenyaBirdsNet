<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>As we seem to have a dearth of water birds in all 
their old haunts and as we were told that they were now congregating at an 
estate seasonal pond in Bombolulu area we decided to check it out. Sum total 3 
Long Tailed Cormorants!&nbsp; Seems they have gone walkabout. Huseni Dairy 
lands&nbsp;our next stop, everything green and lush. Hundred of Starlings, 
Superb, Violet Backed and Greater Blue Earred.&nbsp; Lots of Zanzibar Bishops. 
Pin Tail Whydahs, males just getting their long tails accompanied by a Village 
Indigo Bird. A "lifer" for one of my walkers and something we haven't&nbsp;had 
on our list&nbsp;for ages. Three Senegal Plovers in the grass. A foray down to 
the Car Track pond turned up Yellow Throated and Pangani's Longclaw and some 
Water Dikkops, otherwise very quiet not a water bird in sight. (Marlene Reid -
