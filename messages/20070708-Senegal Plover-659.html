<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>An amusing birding anecdote!&nbsp; One night last 
week, after celebrating a birthday with a few friends with good food and nice 
wine, I retired to bed and found that I had a mid-night visitor in my bedroom. 
Flying madly round the room was a medium sized bird, fairly long wing span, 
white in wings and underside.&nbsp; Not being a in a very fit state to start 
IDing and being most concerned about capturing the bird before it damaged its 
wings I managed to flush it down to the floor in a dark corner, threw a light 
cover over it and took it out onto the balustrade of the verandah from where it 
flew down to the garden.&nbsp; I did get a good view of its long 
dark&nbsp;legs,&nbsp;dark brown back, grey crown with white forehead, bright 
white secondaries. While in my hand wrapped in towel I had close up view of the 
yellow eye with narrow red ring round iris and a not very distinct 
orbital&nbsp;eye-ring.&nbsp; I jotted all this info down feeling that this was a 
bird I was fairly familiar with but not being up to the task of 
remembering...and sure enough in the morning I went straight to the Plover page 
to confirm it as a Senegal Plover. A bird we see up on the grasslands at Nguuni. 
Zimmerman says it is active at night but strange it flew into my room, 
presumably through the open French door. Pretty far from the grassland! A 
special birthday present!&nbsp; Keep birding Marlene Reid
