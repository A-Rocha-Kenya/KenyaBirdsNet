<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Hi All Fellow Birders,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>July birdwalk, around Huseini car track, all very 
muddy,&nbsp;was hardly worth commenting on species wise although I now have a 
group of lively children, all from the same family, brought&nbsp;by their 
grandad who is a vet, and all very keen, so just looking at a big flock of 
Cattle Egrets and seeing a Black Headed heron at close quarters provided a lot 
of excitement. Lizard Buzzard flying low over our heads, made their day. All 
lifers for them.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Sept. we decided to explore an old haunt of mine, 
the Bamburi Shale quarries on the edge of Nguu Tatu, now being planted with 
trees to sustain some new venture by Lafarge to burn wood instead of coal! 
Anyway it provided some very good birding and made for very easy walking.&nbsp; 
The pond was a mass of nesting weavers, Village, Grosbeak, Golden Palm and one 
Golden Weaver with its orange eye. Zanzibar Bishops were numerous and in the 
middle of the pond a lovely Yellow Billed Egret. Diedrik Cukoo male singing, 
female hovering round the nest site awaiting her chance to deposit an egg no 
doubt. Further up the path a fabulous Mangrove Kingfisher, Paradise Flycatcher 
(brown phase), several Tropical Boubous, easily seen for a change, and&nbsp;lots 
of&nbsp;Pale Flycatchers. Scarlet Chested Sunbird, not seen for a long time on 
our walks,&nbsp;medium sized flock of&nbsp;Red Billed Quelea. As we came to the 
end of the walk, a last visit to the pond produced Allen's Gallinule, African 
Black Crake&nbsp;and flying over our heads a beautiful Purple Heron. Migrants 
were 3 Common Sandpipers flying off from the swamp.&nbsp; 35 species in all, not 
bad for 2 hours. Welcome Mombasa Bird Walk, every 3rd Sat in the month. Meet 
Ratna Square 4 p.m. sharp. - Marlene Reid.</FONT></DIV></BODY></HTML>
