Hi Neil

I don't normally respond to these, but couldn't let this one go 

For information BirdLife International is a global partnership of
conservation organisations.  This includes non governmental
organisations in 18 African countries, staffed by Africans.  They are
supported by a BirdLife partnership office based in Nairobi, also
staffed by Africans. Many of them are young organisations with few
resources and few staff but they are all 'in touch' and doing an
excellent job of trying to protect birds against tough odds, and have
had some notable successes.

Both RSPB and BirdLife (with active support from our African partners)
have been heavily involved in the successful lobby to ban the wild bird
trade in the European Union.  Yes it was helped by avian influenza and
yes there are some exemptions for zoos but it was still a hard fight and
it will make a big difference for wild birds.  I am copying in a  couple
of colleagues who played a big part in that.

We do not 'encourage this trade' and I am not sure what leads you to
think that.  

But you raise a good point.  All crane species are on Annex 2 of CITES
but none of the African ones are on Annex 1. I will try and find out if
there is history on this and maybe this is something that can be pushed
as a priority - I am sure ICF must have tried this already. Of course
trade is only one of the threats facing these magnificent birds

Very best wishes

Paul

Subject: [AfricanBirding] trade in cranes

this depressing note in from the International Crane Foundation.

 """ We have found that
 South Africa , Kenya ,
 Uganda ,
 Mali and
 Nigeria are all exporting cranes as
well - and these are only the countries we looked at - so there may be
more. """"

What a mess and none of the International NGOs are doing anything about
it.

CITES, TRAFFIC, Birdlife International &amp; the RSPB actually encourage
this trade as they remain convinced that poor Africans benefit from it.
Not that they know any of course. That's how far out of touch these
conservation bureaucrats have become.

Our Wattled Cranes now well below 200 birds, perhaps even less than 100
in total.

Grey Crowned Cranes continue to "hang on" in small numbers in protected
areas but, well, do we have any evidence that we have as many as 1000
left.

No reports of "numbers" from anyone in recent years. What about that
non-breeding flock of &gt; 100 on West Kilimanjaro. Any recent sightings ?

There is good historical data from the NCA, any recent counts out there
?

Can't think of anything polite to say about this.
