Neil,
These International NGOs are a menace. They have no idea of the practical situation 
and also they don't seem to realise that their so-called efforts at conservation actually do 
more harm than good - you look at the proposed Wildlife Bill for Kenya, it is a disaster. 
The Africans do not benefit from this trade, or any other wildlife trade,  it is depleting their 
country of its natural resources.
We are battling against the Wildlife Act, the new proposal to do sugarcane farming in the 
Tana Delta and various other crazy ideas!

Subject:        	[KENYABIRDSNET] trade in cranes

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
this depressing note in from the International Crane Foundation.

 """ We have found that
 South Africa , Kenya ,
 Uganda ,
 Mali and
 Nigeria are all exporting cranes as
well – and these are only the countries we looked at – so there may be
more. """"

What a mess and none of the International NGOs are doing anything
about it.

CITES, TRAFFIC, Birdlife International &amp; the RSPB actually encourage
this trade as they remain convinced that poor Africans benefit from
it. Not that they know any of course. That's how far out of touch
these conservation bureaucrats have become.

Our Wattled Cranes now well below 200 birds, perhaps even less than
100 in total.

Grey Crowned Cranes continue to "hang on" in small numbers in
protected areas but, well, do we have any evidence that we have as
many as 1000 left.

No reports of "numbers" from anyone in recent years. What about that
non-breeding flock of &gt; 100 on West Kilimanjaro. Any recent sightings
?

There is good historical data from the NCA, any recent counts out
there ?

Can't think of anything polite to say about this.
