<P>Hi Neil<BR><BR>I don't normally respond to these, but couldn't let this one 
go <BR></P>
<P><BR></P>
<P style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">GOOD, IT'S A SUBJECT THAT CERTAINLY REQUIRES 
AIRING. PERHAPS ON THE NEW ABC DEBATE FORUM. <BR></P>
<P><BR>For information BirdLife International is a global partnership 
of<BR>conservation organisations. This includes non 
governmental<BR>organisations in 18 African countries, staffed by Africans. They 
are<BR>supported by a BirdLife partnership office based in 
<ST1><ST1>Nairobi</ST1></ST1>, also<BR>staffed by Africans. Many of them are 
young organisations with few<BR>resources</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">YES, IT IS CLEAR THEY HAVE FEW RESOURCES BUT WHY 
??????</P>
<P><O></O></P>
<P>and few staff</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">YES, TERRIBLY UNDERSTAFFED BUT WHY ???</P>
<P><O></O></P>
<P>but they are all 'in touch' </P>
<P style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">HOW CAN THEY BE, THEY HAVE SO "FEW RESOURCES" AND 
SO "FEW STAFF" ?</P>
<P><O></O></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">IF THEY ARE IN TOUCH WHY HAVE NONE OF THEM 
EXPRESSED DEEP CONCERNS ABOUT THIS TRADE . WOULD LIKE TO BET VERY FEW, IF ANY, 
HAVE REAL FIGURES ON TRADE OR EVEN A STAFF MEMBER WORKING ON IT. </SPAN><BR></P>
<P><O></O></P>
<P>and doing an excellent job </P>
<P style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">THIS IS SERIOUSLY DEBATABLE. HOW CAN THEY WITH SO 
FEW RESOURCES AND SO FEW STAFF ?</P>
<P style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">IF THE UN IS FAILING <ST1>AFRICA</ST1> (AND THEY 
ARE NOT UNDERSTAFFED) WHAT CHANCE DO THESE SO FEW HAVE ?</P>
<P><O></O></P>
<P>of trying to protect birds against tough odds, and have had some notable 
successes.</P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">WOULD BE GOOD TO LIST THESE NOTABLE 
SUCCESSES, NOT SURE MANY FOLK ARE AWARE OF THEM. IS THERE A URL YOU CAN SHARE 
WITH US ON THIS ?</SPAN><BR><BR>Both RSPB and BirdLife (with active support from 
our African partners)<BR>have been heavily involved in the successful lobby to 
ban the wild bird<BR>trade in the European Union. Yes it was helped by avian 
influenza </P>
<P style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">WHERE WERE YOU BEFORE A.I. RAISED IT'S HEAD ?</P>
<P><O></O></P>
<P>andyes there are some exemptions for zoos </P>
<P style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">WHERE DO THESE CRANES GO IF NOT TO ZOOS ? NOT MANY 
SADDLE-BILL STORKS IN THE PET TRADE.<BR></P>
<P><O></O></P>
<P>but it was still a hard fight andit will make a big difference for wild 
birds. </P>
<P style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">SOME EVIDENCE PLEASE.&nbsp; LAST TWO YEARS FIGURES 
FROM <ST1><ST1>TANZANIA</ST1></ST1> WOULD BE A GOOD START HERE. WHICH WILD BIRDS 
IN PARTICULAR, SPECIES AND COUNTRIES PLEASE.<BR></P>
<P><O></O></P>
<P style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF TRADE TO THE MIDDLE EAST ? AND 
THE FAR EAST ? AND THE <ST1><ST1>USA</ST1></ST1> ?</P><BR>
<P><O></O></P>
<P>I am copying in a couple of colleagues who played a big part in 
that.<BR><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">WOULD BE INTERESTING TO HAVE A URL TO 
DISSEMINATE THIS GOOD NEWS.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><BR></SPAN></P>
<P><O></O></P>
<P>We do not 'encourage this trade' and I am not sure what leads you to<BR>think 
that. </P>
<P style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">PAUL, I BEGAN THIS TRADE DEBATE WITH THE RSPB IN 
1983.&nbsp; IN 1993 AT ROSSENHEIM WHERE WERE "YOU" ON THIS DEBATE ?25 ODD YEARS 
FOR YOU GUYS TO BEGIN TO DISCOURAGE IT AND THEN ONLY BECAUSE "YOU" THOUGHT A.I. 
MIGHT BECOME AN ISSUE. AND STILL YOU ARE NOT TAKING ON THE ZOO TRADE OR THE 
ILLEGAL TRADE OR THE NON-EU TRADE. TRAFFIC TELL US THAT BIRDS ARE NOT THEIR 
PRIORITY SO WHO SHOULD BE ON THIS PARTICULAR CASE OTHER THAN THE RSPB AND 
BIRDLIFE ? <BR></P>
<P><O></O></P>
<P>But you raise a good point. All crane species are on Annex 2 of CITES</P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">WHICH IS TOTALLY TOOTHLESS.</SPAN><BR></P>
<P><BR></P>
<P>but none of the African ones are on Annex 1. I will try and find out 
if<BR>there is history on this and maybe this is something that can be 
pushed<BR>as a priority - I am sure ICF must have tried this already.<BR></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">NO DOUBT IT WILL BE DISCUSSED AT THE NAIVASHA 
CRANE TRADE MEETING NEXT MONTH.</SPAN><BR></P>
<P><BR></P>
<P>Of course trade is only one of the threats facing </P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">DO NOT GET ME GOING ON THIS OLD SONG OF 
YOURS. WE ARE ALL WELL AWARE THAT WE HAVE A HUGE POPULATION EXPLOSION IN 
</SPAN><ST1>AFRICA</ST1><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"> AND HABITAT DEGRADATION 
DUE POVERTY IS THE BIG ISSUE BUT NONE OF US AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT YOU AND YOUR 
UNDER RESOURCED ORGANISATIONS CAN EVEN BEGIN TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE ON THIS 
ONE.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><BR></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">BUT OUR LARGE BIRDS ARE GOING FROM OUR 
PROTECTED AREAS BECAUSE THE WEST DOES NOT CARE ENOUGH TO STOP THIS TRADE. IT IS 
AS SIMPLE AS THAT AND HAS BEEN FOR A VERY LONG TIME. DURING WHICH WE HAVE LOST 
MOST OF OUR LARGE WATERBIRDS. HAVE YOU LOOKED AT SHOEBILL TRADE DATA, HORRIFIC. 
AMERICAN ZOOS EVEN EMPLOY A LOBBYIST TO WORK THEIR SYSTEM FOR 
THEM.</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
