<FONT FACE="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><SPAN STYLE='font-size:12.0px'>Hello All, <BR>
Just some of my notes on dates for arrivals and other observations from Laikipia (our place is opposite Mpala farm):<BR>
<BR>
Sep13 &nbsp;Northern Whetears at Kimanjo<BR>
Sep20 &nbsp;Eurasian Bee-eaters arriving<BR>
Sep27 &nbsp;Diedricks cuckoos being spotted around the place<BR>
Oct.12 &nbsp;Isabaleine Whetear at our Boma<BR>
<BR>
Oct. 13 The Euro bee-eaters are continuing to pass. On sep 23rd we had several steel blue whydahs with females near our offices and now I can&#8217;t seem to find them? (what is the deal with this species?) &nbsp;Straw tailed Whydas in breeding dress. &nbsp;We have had hundreds of Purple rollers around for the past several months (these are an inter african migrant no? Where do they come from?) &nbsp;Oct. 3 <B>Finfoot male on Ewaso</B>. &nbsp;&nbsp;Bare-faced Thrush not far from the Ewaso Nyiro River ( I find these guys on us very infrequently). Oct. 3 Red headed weaver building nest. &nbsp;Green Wood Hoopoes nesting in Sycamore Fig by Ewaso. &nbsp;<B>Oct. 7 Swallow-tailed Kite over Ewaso</B> &#8211; our first spotting of this species over Tumaren. &nbsp;Oct. 7 Cinnamon Rock Buntings near Ewaso.<BR>
<BR>
Non bird recent highlights include several caracal sightings as well as wild cat and lion. &nbsp;Not long back kerry glen (wife) found a blue tree agama but we have not yet been able to refind him. &nbsp;His range map for the north seems very spotty.<BR>
<BR>
Cheers, James christian<BR>
