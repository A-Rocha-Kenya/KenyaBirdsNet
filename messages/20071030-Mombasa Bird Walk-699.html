<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Still not many migrants around although waders are 
now numerous in the beach areas. A lone Common Sandpiper which may in fact be 
resident and a magnificent Madagascar Squacco Heron preening in a tree. We used 
to see lots of these around May to Oct but it is a rare treat to see one these 
days. Lots of Yellow Throated Longclaws. Golden Palm Weavers and Gros Beak 
Weavers, males mostly, busy collecting nesting materials. One or two females 
inspecting the nearly finished nests.&nbsp; Brown phase Paradise Flycatcher and 
a Batis Minor. Bare Eyed Thrushes, Water Dikkops. Superb Starlings, and Scarlet 
Chested Sunbird (which we haven't seen for ages) were some of the other 
specials. This area although somewhat spoiled since becoming an animal park is 
still a good place to see birds. 32 species seen in 11/2 hours.&nbsp; The final 
and most wonderful sight at dusk in a beautiful sunset was about 2000 Barn 
Swallows coming to roost in a reed bed. Just amazing how they circle round 
spying out the land and then suddenly they are all down. Such a priveledge to 
see! Come birding with us if you are in Mombasa on the 3rd Sat. in the month.
