<br>Your suggestion about a petition is a good one. However, this is something 
for Kenyan organizations to take the lead on. Perhaps the EAWS and Nature 
Kenya (KWS??)could team up to ensure that veterinary diclofenac is not 
registered at least in Kenya as a legal pharmaceutical.
<br>
<br>With the drug banned in India and Pakistan, there is likely to be a pathway 
for stocks to end up in Africa. There is free movement of vultures and other 
scavengers between Kenya and Tanzania and therefore Kenyans should be 
concerned about diclofenac's availability in Tanzania. Remember that it only 
takes ONE carcass out of between 250 and 1000 to cause the magnitude of 
decline that has been observed in the Indian subcontinent.
<br>
<br>Lastly, as you all prepare for the festive season and your birdwatching 
safaris, please be on the look out for:
<br>1) tagged vultures;
<br>2) dead vultures; and
<br>3) diclofenac for veterinary use.
<br>
<br>Happy birding

<br>Dear Munir et al
<br>Just a quick suggestion about "diclofenac"
<br>Could WCST, Birdlife, Peregrine Fund put up a petition form that could be 
signed
<br>via email or something.

<br>
<br>
<br>Investigations by WCST (WildLife Conservation Society of Tanzania, 
Birdlife
<br>in Tanzania), have confirmed that Diclofenac has been licensed for 
veterinary
<br>use in the country.
<br>
<br>Diclofenac induces fatal illness in vultures of the Gyps genus. Its use to
<br>treat livestock in the Indian subcontinent has driven three Gyps species 
to
<br>the brink of extinction.
<br>
<br>"This is shocking news, and means that the threat is far greater than we
<br>thought" -Paul Nnyiti , WCST
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>An official from Tanzania's Ministry of Livestock told Paul Nnyiti of WCST
<br>that Diclofenac is licensed and stocked in veterinary centres, and 
available
<br>under prescription by qualified veterinary personnel.
<br>
<br>"This is shocking news, and means that the threat is far greater than we
<br>thought," said Paul Nnyiti of WCST. "We now fear that Diclofenac may also
<br>already be licensed and used in other African countries. BirdLife Partners
<br>must work quickly to alert governments and veterinary organisations to the
<br>dangers of the drug, and campaign for licenses to be revoked and 
Diclofenac
<br>to be withdrawn from sale throught the African continent."
