Dear Munir et al
Just a quick suggestion about "diclofenac"
Could WCST, Birdlife, Peregrine Fund put up a petition form that could be signed
via email or something.

Vulture-killing drug licensed in Tanzania
07-11-2007


Investigations by WCST (WildLife Conservation Society of Tanzania, Birdlife
in Tanzania), have confirmed that Diclofenac has been licensed for veterinary
use in the country.

Diclofenac induces fatal illness in vultures of the Gyps genus. Its use to
treat livestock in the Indian subcontinent has driven three Gyps species to
the brink of extinction. 

"This is shocking news, and means that the threat is far greater than we
thought" -Paul Nnyiti , WCST 



An official from Tanzania's Ministry of Livestock told Paul Nnyiti of WCST
that Diclofenac is licensed and stocked in veterinary centres, and available
under prescription by qualified veterinary personnel. 

"This is shocking news, and means that the threat is far greater than we
thought," said Paul Nnyiti of WCST. "We now fear that Diclofenac may also
already be licensed and used in other African countries. BirdLife Partners
must work quickly to alert governments and veterinary organisations to the
dangers of the drug, and campaign for licenses to be revoked and Diclofenac
to be withdrawn from sale throught the African continent."
