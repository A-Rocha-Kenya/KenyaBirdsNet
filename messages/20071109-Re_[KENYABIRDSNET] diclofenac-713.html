They then get eaten by vultures because people DO NOT eat them.<br><br>For sure cattle are important to various pastoralist tribes in East Africa but does anyone know of a single instance that these same people spend money on animals with aches and pains. If they cannot keep up with the herd due to leg injuries they are EATEN.<br><br>Dr Charles Dulle in Iringa stocks Diclofenac but VERY rarely sells any. More people than animals take this pain killing drug in Tanzania !!! It's possible the zero grazing
 communities would use this drug for an animal that still yields milk<br><br>BUT<br><br>and this is a rather large BUT<br><br>these animals are NEVER eaten by vultures.<br><br>In fact VERY few of our cows are eaten by vultures. For sure throughout Sukumaland one occasionally finds a few vultures around the REMAINS of a dead cow but these are VERY rural communities. I would be really surprised if such communities purchase even moderate quantities of Diclofenic let alone enough to cause our vultures problems.<br><br>Hundreds of dead cows in our northern Rift Valley early last year due to drought, no vultures feeing on them, still enough large ungulates.<br><br>In West Africa vulture numbers are down some 97% due to huge losses of wildlife. There are still HUGE numbers of cattle !!!<br><br>This is, in my view, yet another example of smoke and mirrors conservation. There are issues out there but they are less headline grabbing than these emotive, high
 profile, climb on a bandwagon ones.<br><br>Of course I stand to be corrected here so REAL DATA most welcome.<br><br>Neil<br><div>&nbsp;</div>Neil and Liz Baker, Tanzania Bird Atlas, P.O.

be withdrawn from sale throught the African continent.”</font></span></p></span><p></p>
