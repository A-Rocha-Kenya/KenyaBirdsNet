Dear all

have a message from Brian , on safari . He had a first sighting of a
Chestnut-banded Plover at the Athi dam in NNP .

I have had a quiet 3 months since coming back from the bird fair but
managed a couple of trips with relatives upto Nakuru via Naivasha .

Naivasha at Hippo point was a quick stop over  en route  , nothing much
to report with a few migrants such as Common Stonechat, Northern
Wheatear and some Ruffs

Lake Nakuru was more interesting , with 30+ Steppe Eagles and many
hundreds of Barn Swallows. On the second visit many of the Steppe Eagles
had moved on but we got a nice view of  a Eurasian Marsh Harrier .  My
own find was a pair of Grey-crested Helmet-shrikes

Brian on the mobile again , just missed a Taveta Golden Weaver on a nest
in Amboseli . He has strict instructions to find and photo before he
comes back !

happy birding


Mike D
