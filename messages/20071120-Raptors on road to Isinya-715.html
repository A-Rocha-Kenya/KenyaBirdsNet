Nature Kenya&#8217;s Sunday Birdwatch became a drive through the open country along the Kiserian to Isinya road, and on to Kajiado. Surprising sightings included:<BR>
<BR>
An Augur Buzzard eating a nestling or small grassland bird. Just a few metres from us on a fencepost, we could see the bird&#8217;s feet and bits of grass in the buzzard&#8217;s claws. A variation from its usual diet of rats and mole rats!<BR>
<BR>
A Black-headed Heron, however, caught and swallowed a big fat rat.<BR>
<BR>
Adult and immature Gabar Goshawks were mobbed by Superb Starlings.<BR>
<BR>
A Greater Kestrel perched obligingly on a small Balanites tree until all 8 participating vehicles had stopped, giving all a good view of its barred rufous plumage and grey-black tail.<BR>
<BR>
Other highlights included:<BR>
Kori Bustard<BR>
Great Spotted Cuckoo eating termites on the road<BR>
Black-and-white Cuckoo<BR>
Isabelline Wheatear<BR>
Red-backed Shrike<BR>
<BR>
And a very large tortoise drinking from a rain pool on the roadside.<BR>
<BR>
Wishing you good birding, Fleur<BR>
