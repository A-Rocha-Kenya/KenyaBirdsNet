<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Sat Nov 17th - Visited Central Quarry. Good to see 
that some of the thicket round the lake had been cleared and that we could see 
the water. Our hope to see some migrants was completely disappointing with the 
exception of one or two Barn Swallows swooping by overhead.&nbsp; However the 
water birds were great.&nbsp; No less than 3 Allen's Gallinules, a quick view of 
a Common Moorhen, African Black Crake, Several Water Dikkops, Great White Egret, 
Little Egret and hundreds of Cattle Egrets.&nbsp; Weavers were busy nest 
building, Golden Palm, Grosbeak and Village. Grey and Green Backed Herons, Pied 
Kingfishers&nbsp;and&nbsp;a couple beautiful Malachite Kingfishers. Lots of Red 
Billed Queleas around. They seem to be in large numbers everywhere this year 
boding no good for the grain growers. As we were leaving Bee-Eaters flew high 
overhead but not being that clever with their call had to go unidentified.&nbsp; 
The large numbers of Greenshanks we used to see at the quarry seem to have 
disappeared, probably found a place with more beach area.&nbsp; If you are in 
Mombasa join us (Marlene Reid)</FONT></DIV></BODY></HTML>
