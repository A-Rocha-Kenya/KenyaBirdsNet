Dear all
Yestareday spent my day birding around the Ol Doinyo Sapuk in Thika. 
Had about 20 individuals of Eurasian Bee eaters, Barn Swallows.

Had only 40 min in the park which was far much worth confirming a breeding
record of Hinde's Babbler. 4 individuals and atleast one juvenile with large
visible pale gape, dark eye, very pale brown flanks with no mottlings and
making hash call like begging for food.

Also Red-capped Robin Chat singing but could not located. They were around last
dec and jan which may mean they are resident???????????

With Kind Regards

Dear all,
It has been long (a year in fact) since I had a chance of birding down the
Magadi Road. Today I took the opportunity and together with Brian and Tal we
drove down to see what can we find.
 
Over all it is very dry all over the place and even at Ol-tepesi there is no
water as the pipe have been broken and the place is deserted.
 
Very few birds all the way down and the habitat seems to be vanishing in a
hazardous speed to charcoal burnings. At the first bridge where we were used
to see so many birds it seems that there is no more trees left to support
birds. What is left, is already being hammered.
 
After the disappointment at Ol-tepesi we decided to continue down the Eremit
Rd. to try and find some of the birds that Brian reported before from this
area.
 
All the way to Eremit is was still very dry and other than the few Singing
Bush Larks, there was not much to stop for. At one point where we stopped,
Brian found a nice male Yellow-throated Plated Lizard in full breeding
colours that brought some interest to this dull morning.
 
When arriving to the Eremit Valley, we found some water and also some birds
at last. 
It was not long till we saw the first interesting bird; a White-headed Barbet
of the subspecies leucocephalus which is usually found only in Ruma NP, Mt.
Elgon and Kongelai Escarpment. What does it do so far to the east is still a
mystery to be solved…
Further down the stream a Bearded Woodpecker (which is a nice bird wherever
you find one) and a group of Arrow-marked Babblers that the nearest record
should be Lake Naivasha. Also around was a pair of Northern Brownbuls that
are more related to Tsavo, Amboseli and Samburu usually than the southern
Rift Valley.
 
On the migrants’ front, not much was seen during the all day, but few
Willow Warblers, at least 2-3 Upcher’s Warblers and few more Spotted
Flycatchers. Not a single migrant raptor and only 2 raptors all together. On
the way back a breeding male Steel-blue Whydah was also passing by.
 
Surprises are still awaiting to be found down the southern parts of the Rift
Valley and so close to Nairobi, but with the current decrease in habitat it
is probably a very tight race what will come first?!

I rather go birding...
