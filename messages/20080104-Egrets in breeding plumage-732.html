The Wednesday Morning Birdwalk, undaunted (so far) by public holidays or civil unrest, visited Manguo Ponds in Limuru on December 26. There we saw about five White-backed Ducks, dozens of Northern Shovelers, and two female or immature Maccoa Ducks, plain brown but with their tails held upright.<BR>
<BR>
The most interesting, however, were the egrets. There were Cattle, Great and Yellow-billed Egrets. The Great Egret had a black bill, indicating breeding plumage. The Yellow-billed Egrets were flying all over the wetland, chasing each other. After a while we realized that one of them had long, yellowish or cream-coloured plumes extending several centimetres past the centre of the tail. I had never seen this before, but I read in Birds of Africa that in breeding plumage: &#8220;...aigrettes ...on scapulars extend well beyond tip of tail, sometimes to feet in males.&#8221; Where are (or were) these egrets likely to breed?<BR>

With best wishes to you, and for Kenya, from Fleur</SPAN></FONT>
