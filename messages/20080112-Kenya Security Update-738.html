Friday 11 January 2008: Security Update 10.30 p.m.

Today was another entirely normal day in Nairobi and Mombasa with no problems or
incidents reported. There were also no reports of any incidents or problems
affecting tourists in any of Kenya’s parks and reserves or on any of the roads
connecting them.

There were no reports today of any demonstrations or violent disturbances
elsewhere in the country.

Talks between the government and the opposition have not been held today as
originally planned but both sides confirmed their call to all their supporters
to shun violence and to be committed to maintaining peace. Former UN Secretary
General, Kofi Annan, is expected to arrive in Nairobi next week to assist in
seeking a reconciliation between the two parties. Parliament will be opened on
Tuesday. The opposition have announced that they will hold peaceful rallies in
different parts of the country on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Tour
operators will ensure that tourist vehicles avoid any rallies and
demonstrations but the organisers have stressed that these are intended to be
peaceful assemblies.

Hello . . . 

Given the recent occurrences in Kenya, can you tell me if wildlife safaris
are currently 
operating normally or if there is any limited access into the Rift Valley --
Mt. Kenya, Lake 
Nakuru, Lake Naivasha, Lake Baringo, Kakamega Forest Reserve, or the Maasai
Mara Reserve?

Is it really safe?  The State Department, et al,  says "no," but the tour
companies say "yes."  We 
are trying to decide if we should go on 2/18 birding safari with
Elderhostel.

Thank you.
