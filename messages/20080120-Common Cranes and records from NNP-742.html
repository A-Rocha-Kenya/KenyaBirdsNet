<DIV>Dear All,<BR><BR>On 19th January I left in the early morning with Nigel Hunter, to go up to <BR>Naivasha to see the two Common Cranes on Marula Farm. We arrived early and <BR>met up with Franny Simpson, who very kindly took us to the paddock where the <BR>two Common Cranes were feeding with some fifty Crowned Cranes, and a number <BR>of Spur-winged Geese. I took some digital photographs and video of he birds <BR>as they fed quite unconcernedly.&nbsp; This is probably the first record of the <BR>species in the Southern Hemisphere!!! The farm was very attractive to birds, <BR>and on the driveway from the Simpsons house we found an obliging Northern <BR>Carmine Bee-eater, only the second record I have personally seen st <BR>Naivasha, the previous being some ten years ago at what was Safariland <BR>Lodge.<BR>After this we departed for Hippo Point, spending a couple of hours here as <BR>the conditions were very nice for waterside birds, although there is
 a lot <BR>of water hyacinth. The water level is quite high, and the growth of typha <BR>off shore has resulted in protected lagoons inshore. Amongst the more <BR>interesting species here were a lone Black Heron fishing in the shallows, <BR>many Purple Herons, only a handful of Glossy Ibis, an adult Lesser <BR>Black-backed Gull, amongst the commoner waders were up to fifteen <BR>Black-tailed Godwits,&nbsp; a single Spotted Redshank, and one African Snipe <BR>amongst the Common Snipe.&nbsp; There was a good variety of the regular <BR>waterbirds, and the area was very interesting. The Yellow Wagtails present <BR>were flava, otherwise not many migrant passerines present. Another <BR>interesting species in the scrub was a Pale Flycatcher, which I cannot ever <BR>recall seeing around Naivasha before.<BR>We returned to the Simpsons again and Hugh took us down to the Maleva delta. <BR>Along the road we had a pair of Ground Hornbills, and a solitary
 <BR>Hildebrandt’s Francolin in the dense fever-tree forest. There is so much <BR>habitat on Marula, providing good protection for the woodland birds in the <BR>area. There were four Montagu’s Harriers feeding over one paddock. At the <BR>mouth of the Maleva they have constructed an extremely sturdy tower <BR>overlooking the waterbirds and some 150 Hippo. Amongst the birds here we had <BR>a single adult Black-headed Gull, seven Pintail and a Shoveler, but the high <BR>water level meant that there was no shoreline for waders, although the dozen <BR>Long-toed Plovers were at home on the floating vegetation.<BR><BR>A couple of kilometres from here there are four beautiful bungalows for <BR>visitors accommodations and he whole area is vast with so much of interest <BR>and so much interesting habitat. I will post details of renting these as <BR>soon as they come to hand.<BR><BR>On the 20th (Sunday) I went into Nairobi National Park again with Nigel
 <BR>Hunter. We were going on to look for the Upcher’s Warbler at Ivory Burning <BR>Site where I had seen one the previous week, as it is a species that has <BR>always eluded Nigel.&nbsp; We were fortunate in locating the bird in the same <BR>acacia, but amazingly there was a second bird holding another territory in a <BR>neighbouring tree. Whilst Nigel was studying the second bird I heard <BR>something familiar but very out of context calling from the first tree, and <BR>returned to see what was calling like a Northern Brownbul. There in the tree <BR>was a Northern Brownbul, an extremely lost bird, and not only a new species <BR>for the Park, but also a new species for the Nairobi region. The bird flew <BR>into the scrub near to the toilets and would not be coaxed out of cover.<BR>Not far up from the road towards the back of Hyena Dam was a very noisy <BR>immature Ayre’s Hawk-Eagle.<BR><BR>The weather then deteriorated and most of the remainder of
 the day was <BR>showery with some quite heavy falls interspersed with short dry spells, <BR>nevertheless the birding was quite good. Most other records of interest came <BR>from the burnt areas, here there were eight or so Montagu’s Harrier, one <BR>female Pallid, a Eurasian Buzzard and a migrant Black Kite, singles each of <BR>Common and Lesser Kestrels, four each of Black-winged Plovers and Temminck’s <BR>Coursers, amongst the quite numerous Barn Swallow were singles House and <BR>Sand Martins. About twenty Isabelline, five Northern and three Pied <BR>Wheatears, five Whinchats, over one-hundred Yellow Wagtails, all examined <BR>being lutea apart from one flava, five Tree Pipits, and Parasitic Weavers <BR>were met with five times with singing males on their territories. Athi Dam <BR>was so disappointing only two Yellow-billed Storks, no Marabous even, the <BR>only Palaearctic waders being single Greenshank and Common Sandpiper, but <BR>over sixty
 Little Stints is the largest number I have ever seen in the Park <BR>before.<BR>About twenty Red-throated Pipits fed on the damp roads.<BR><BR>Spread over the park were five Red-tailed Shrikes and five Nightingales, <BR>very few willow Warblers, and a couple of Spotted Flycatchers. On the <BR>descent road from Baboon Cliffs the rain had brought four African <BR>Firefinches out onto the road where they fed away from cover on the tarmac <BR>with a Nightingale. There was a Hildebrandt’s Francolin on the road after <BR>crossing the Mokoyiet bridge, a species so rarely seen in the park. At &nbsp; <BR>Leopard Cliffs there were six species of swifts including one Pallid Swift <BR>flying below us. Also here was the most extravert African Firefinch I have <BR>ever seen, feeding on the steps and videoed as it hopped towards us.<BR><BR>The recent wet weather has caused the mammals so numerous last week, to <BR>vacate the Park and spread into the surrounding
 area. The minor roads are in <BR>a bad state and slippery in the rain, but the birds more than compensate for <BR>this.<BR><BR>&nbsp;</DIV>
