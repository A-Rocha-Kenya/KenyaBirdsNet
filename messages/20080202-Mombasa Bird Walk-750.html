<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Mombasa bird walk (Sat. Jan 19th)&nbsp;managed 
to&nbsp;go out.&nbsp;&nbsp;Things are (Thank God) pretty calm overall at the 
Coast.&nbsp; However we decided to play safe and do some birding inside the safe 
confines of&nbsp; Haller Park's South Quarry.&nbsp; This walk was "Herons and 
Egrets". Around 8-10 Yellow Billed (Intermediate) Egrets, Little Egret, Grey, 
Black Headed, Green Backed and one splendid Purple&nbsp;Heron.&nbsp; A trip to 
the restaurant area at the end of the walk turned up 2 Black Crowned Night 
Herons ( a lifer for two of the walkers). A wonderful opportunity to see all 
these herons and egrets up close and see their differences. Migrants were Barn 
Swallow, Common Sandpiper, Greenshank, Wood Sandpiper and Eurasian Golden 
Oriole.&nbsp; Other birds of note Malachite, Pied and Brown Hooded Kingfisher. A 
whole gaggle of Egyptian Geese and a Palm Nut Vulture. One Three Banded Plover 
which we haven't had on our list for ages plus the usual Water Dikkops. A total 
of 30 birds. Some of South Quarry still being worked but ponds in developed area 
doing well and are attracting lots of herons and larger water birds.&nbsp; Not 
much beach for the shorter legged waders. &nbsp;Wishing you all happy and safe 
birding. Join us if you are in Mombasa any 3rd Sat in the month. (Marlene 
Reid-Msa)</FONT></DIV></BODY></HTML>
