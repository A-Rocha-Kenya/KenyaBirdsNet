<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dear Birders,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>As there is not much going on for the guides at 
Haller park due to the drop in tourism we have been taking advantage of the 
situation and going out to enjoy some early morning birding on the last 3 
Mons.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Mon. 14th</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Trip to Central Quarry to see the Purple Gallinule 
(Swamphen) which has now taken up residence there. We arrived a bit late and it 
was keeping well into the reeds so only got a quick glimpse. However the Great 
Painted Snipe, Common Moorhen, Large number of White Faced Whistling Ducks made 
the uncomfortable and hot wait worthwhile.&nbsp; We then drove round to the 
opposite side of the large pond and right across from us in open view was this 
wonderful Purple Gallinule. Having birded at the coast for last 25 years and 
knowing there is supposed to be a small population and having never seen it, it 
was such a thrill. Just have to take my birders up there and hope it is as 
obliging for them.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Mon Jan 28th</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The new development of 2 golf courses at Vipingo is 
such a huge area and great for birding. Fortunately we have an "in" there so 
decided to take advantage of it.&nbsp; In the garden of the old manager's house 
there are wonderful old indigenous trees. Eurasian Golden Orioles were 
everywhere, Brown Breasted Barbet, A hoopoe called but we never did see it 
despite chasing it around the outside wall. White Browed Robin Chat feeding in 
the plant pots. Outside the garden Black Capped Tchagras very common and easily 
seen. Yellow Wagtails everywhere, Grey Headed Kingfisher, fast dash past by a 
Common Kestrel. Further afield, a splendid pair of Black Breasted Snake Eagles, 
one sitting in the tree then being joined by its mate,&nbsp;and an African Hawk 
Eagle which settled in the same tree after flying overhead. Lesser Grey, Red 
Tailed and Red Backed Shrikes, Barn Swallows and a Grey Headed Bush Shrike 
calmly feeding in a bush right in front of us.&nbsp; The grass nursery was alive 
with Grassland Pipits and Yellow Wagtails, just amazing.&nbsp; As we came back 
to the garden for a late breakfast Eurasian Bee-Eaters arrived, not many but my 
first for a long time.&nbsp; So beautiful. 36 species seen between 7 a.m. and 
11, some&nbsp;quite exciting and in such a lovely place. We hope it will 
continue to be a good birding area after the development is finished. Thousands 
of indigenous trees are being planted and the developers are very conservasion 
concious so we live in hope.&nbsp; (Marlene Reid with Tere, Samson, James and
