<DIV>Dear All,<BR><BR>Another attempt to find the Spotted Creepers at Mweiga saw Mike Davidson, <BR>Joseph Kariuki and myself going up on Thursday afternoon and returning <BR>Friday afternoon.<BR><BR><BR>We met up with Paul Kariuki and Sammy on the afternoon and were shown a <BR>roosting Barn Owl under cover in a tree. Perhaps the most exposed individual <BR>I have seen, with them usually favouring enclosed areas like building eaves <BR>or Hamerkop nests.<BR><BR>We walked the grassland along Mike Prettejohn’s airstrip, finding four old <BR>Grass Owl roosting sites but no birds. In the evening&nbsp; there were Spotted <BR>Thicknees chorusing.<BR>We stayed the evening at Sundai, which was very comfortable and excellent <BR>food and is highly recommended at Ksh4500 full board for residents. There <BR>were Dusky and Montane Nightjars calling at dawn. We saw photographs of the <BR>three delightful Grass Owl chicks that Petra raised to maturity
 here.<BR><BR>In the early morning we left for the neighbouring Sangare (0724 078898 <BR>reservations Zuri) luxury tented camp on the Sangare Dam. Sammy used to be <BR>the resident guide here, and says he saw Spotted Creepers on about every <BR>second day (unquote).<BR><BR>I haven’t seen a lakeshore accommodation with such a great birdy lake <BR>before, where so much can be seen without leaving the tent. There were <BR>Shoveler, Southern Pochard, Yellow-bills, Red-bills, Hottentot, an <BR>attractive pair of Maccoa, and at least five pairs of Cape Wigeon which was <BR>most unexpected, and one pair had two young. Additionally there were <BR>Pink-backed Pelican, Great Cormorant, a selection of herons, and waders <BR>though nothing out of the ordinary. Over the lake were a number of very <BR>attractive Angola Swallows. Three Verreaux’s Eagle-Owls posed in the <BR>acacias. In the surrounding bush whilst looking for Creepers we found <BR>Brown-backed
 Woodpecker, several Little Rock Thrush, and Brown Parisomas <BR>were numerous with about ten birds encountered. Brown Parrots are in large <BR>numbers, and Red-fronteds are present alongside them. It was very very bird <BR>indeed, and we were most impressed with what we saw in the short time we <BR>were there. The lake has every swamp habitat available, sedgy swamps where <BR>the water drains into a small river that flows into the Aboni, dense reed <BR>beds, fallen trees, islands, boulders in water around the edge, open water <BR>and muddy margins.&nbsp; The surrounding scrubby valleys and acacia woodlands are <BR>so unspoilt and natural. There is so much potential here awaiting discovery.<BR><BR>It is amazing how many wonderful places exist, that for me at least are only <BR>coming to light since losing safaris and having the time to explore places <BR>at no great distance from Nairobi.<BR><BR>Best to all<BR>Brian</DIV></div></body></html>
