<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Hi from Mombasa to all birders.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>We now have&nbsp; Purple Gallinule 
(Swamphen)&nbsp;in the central quarry, which is literally a few hundred yards 
from the busy main Mombasa-Malindi road, as the crow flies ( a very descriptive 
terminology considering how many there are at the moment), and is an area 
blasted with the sounds of some nearby disco, so surprising that there are so 
many lovely birds in the quarry. Lends credibility to the fact that sound 
doesn't seem to disturb birds.&nbsp; Just felt I had to take the bird walk to 
try and see this lovely bird. Luckily it behaved very well and showed itself to 
everyone.&nbsp; A&nbsp;lifer for all except me and Samson, the Haller Park 
Guide.&nbsp; Also of note a large flock of White Faced Whistling Ducks and a 
sole Fulvous Whistling Duck, a lifer for everyone except me.&nbsp; Common 
Moorhen, an Allen's Gallinule, Great White and Cattle Egrets, Grey, Green 
Backed&nbsp;and Black Headed heron, Golden Palm and Village Weavers in large 
numbers, many Long Tailed Cormorants, Water Dikkops and wonder of wonders a 
Goliath Heron stepping carefully round the very narrow band of beach, in the 
shade of the reeds. A quick visit to the football ground the see the many Yellow 
Wagtails (Barn Swallows only other migrant seen - dozens on the telephone 
wire)&nbsp;brought the walk to a splendid end.&nbsp; Such a great walk.&nbsp; 
Join us&nbsp;when you are in Mombasa. Marlene Reid
