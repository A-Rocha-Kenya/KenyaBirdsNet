<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Last week-end Friends of Fort Jesus went for a 
week-end to Taita Hills to visit old mission stations and first world war 
sites.&nbsp; Very interesting but for the birders among us a quick drive round 
the Taita Hills park was equally (if not more) interesting.&nbsp; Lots of 
Eurasian Rollers, Barn Swallows, One Red-Tailed Shrike, a sleepy Pearl Spotted 
Owlet trying to get to sleep after having kept lodge residents wake with its 
persistent calling. Lots of other common birds but the prize was a Swallow 
Tailed Kite preening in a small bush.&nbsp; Only the 2nd time that I have seen 
this bird, once in Tsavo East. Seeing that was over 10 years ago and 
considering&nbsp; that I have been birding in this general area many times 
since, I was very chuffed.&nbsp; Hunters Sunbirds, Eurasian Golden Orioles, 
Black Headed Orioles, Spotted Flycatchers and lots more common but lovely bush 
birds round the Lodge garden make this a lovely place to spend a few days and it 
is worthwhile taking advantage of the present low rates.&nbsp; Happy 
Birding.</FONT></DIV></BODY></HTML>
