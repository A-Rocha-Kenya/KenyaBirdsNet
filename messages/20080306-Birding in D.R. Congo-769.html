 Greetings 
Nairobi birders have faithfully attended the Wednesday Morning Birdwalks this year. On January 30 at the edge of the Ngong Road Forest at the Racecourse, we were fortunate to see a pair of Black-throated Wattle-eyes and a Grey Apalis in a mixed-flock feeding party. However, we were sad to see the rubbish, particularly plastic bottles, dumped by the restaurants and scattered by the baboons. 
Sunday February 3 was the Game Count in Nairobi National Park, and some of the same birders took part. Bird highlights in our sector were two pairs of Ostriches shepherding a flock of 14 half-grown “teenagers”, a Black Stork at Olmanyi Dam, four Grey Crowned Cranes near Hyena Dam and two more at Olmanyi Dam, six Black-winged Plovers where the grass has been burned and is trying to grow despite the erratic rains, and a flock of gorgeous Eurasian Bee-eaters. The Upcher’s Warbler was still feeding in the flowering acacias at the Ivory Burning site, as were a pair of Yellow-spotted Petronias; and at the gate the Red-chested Cuckoo was still crying “It will rain!!” Does it know something we don’t know? 
Wishing you good birding, Fleur
