<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>As the tide was at the right height we decided to 
go to the beach in Bamburi area to see how many waders were still around.&nbsp; 
Accessing the beach through Aga Khan Centre where we usually see a good variety 
of garden birds was very disappointing probably due to the crows and several 
cats wandering around.&nbsp; On the beach 3 Ethiopian Swallows resting on a 
boat, plenty of Sooty Gulls. Migrant waders on the exposed reef Whimbrels, 
Curlew Sandpipers, Ringed Plovers, Grey Plovers, Lesser and Greater Sand 
Plovers, Little Stints, and Ruddy Turnstones, none in large numbers, some coming 
into breeding dress.&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-migrants - Grey Herons, Little Egrets, 
one&nbsp;lovely Green Backed Heron and several Sacred Ibis catchng the setting 
sun on their wings as they flew back to wherever they roost. </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Still lots of Eurasian Golden Orioles around 
Mombasa and at Vipingo Ridge on Sat 29th a male Common Rock Thrush in bright 
breeding colours. Keep on birding - Marlene Reid (Mombasa)</FONT></DIV>
