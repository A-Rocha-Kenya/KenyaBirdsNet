<p class="MsoNormal">I visited Samburu early this week and it is quite dry as
usual, there were a lot of birds attracted to the cool riverine forest where
they fed on fruiting salvadora trees and shrubs and enjoyed the cool shade,
notable species included; Bristle-Crowned starlings, Magpie Starlings,
White-headed mouse-birds, that among other Samburu residents visited a bird-bathe
provided by the camp askari at the Samburu Intrepid gate, a Narina¢s Trogon was
seen and photographed by a client outside his tent!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Samburu is very good for raptors quite a number of Bateleur¢s
roost on the dead river acacias as well as Hooded, Lappet-faced, White-headed,
White-backed and Ruppell¢s Vultures and one Egyptian Vulture was seen one
morning. Black eagles were also seen hunting Hyrax, and African harrier hawks,
Martial Eagle at least five individuals in three days and at least half a dozen
Tawny eagles gathered at one place, we were to later discover that they had
been feasting on what had become an unfortunate Dik-dik</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In the scrubland were African Silver-bill, Black-capped
social Weavers, Chestnut Sparrows, Donaldson-smith¢s Sparrow-weavers, Somali
Buntings and Pink-breasted Larks</p>
