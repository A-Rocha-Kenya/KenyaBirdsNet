<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Several people have asked what other 
interesting&nbsp;birds we&nbsp;saw on the recent Sunbird tour, so here is a 
short listing of the more&nbsp;unusual sightings:</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dwarf Bittern - one in the deep river gorge that is 
on the right of the road about 10 km south of Olorgosailie on the road to Lake 
Magadi - 16 June (Curiously I saw one in exactly the same spot with Don Turner 
about 20 years ago - and was describing that sighting to my group just before 
this bird appeared!).</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Eurasian Hobby - 1 along the road on the drive 
south from Kakamega to Kisumu - 28 June (a surprise sighting at this time of 
year, but definitely not an African Hobby, watched for several minutes by 
everyone in the group, all of whom are familiar with this reasonably common 
British breeding bird).</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Pintail - an adult male on the Lake Nakuru sewage 
ponds - 24 June (Brian Finch was of the opinion that this might be the first 
June record for Kenya, but I note that Lewis &amp; Pomeroy give details of two 
over-summering individuals (May-July).&nbsp; Clearly VERY unusual 
though.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>African Crake - an adult with a small chick at 
Ahero Rice Scheme - 29 June (I didn't see these myself but they were seen by Zac 
Methu and one member of our group - Stef Cohen).</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>African Finfoot - one at the Blue Posts Hotel where 
the two rivers come together - 17 June&nbsp;(finally! - my first Kenya sighting 
after 27 tours to Kenya!).</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Green Sandpiper - one roosting on the pool at Mt. 
Lodge - 17 June (exactly where so many roost at night each winter, but a 
surprise to me as I did not expect any to over-summer).</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Blue-headed Coucal - an adult in Aberdares National 
Park - 21 June (the first time I have seen this species anywhere other than Lake 
Victoria, though I appreciate that a Kenyan Highland population does 
exist).</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Least Honeyguide - one in the car park at Kichwa 
Tempo Camp - 2 July (Brian Finch says he has seen them there occasionally in the 
past&nbsp;- he lived there for 7 years, of course).</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Whistling Cisticola - one singing on a roadside 
wire at Mungatsi - 27 June (first sighting for me in Kenya, though I've been 
watching out for it for many years along that road).</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Red-billed Buffalo-Weaver - 10 at Ahero Rice Scheme 
- 29 June (this isolated population is described in Zimmerman et al, but I have 
only seen them here once before in about 20 visits to Ahero).</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>We also saw small numbers of several other 
over-summering Palearctic migrants at Lake Nakuru - five White Storks, 20+ 
Greenshanks, c.200 White-winged Black Terns (including several in breeding 
plumage), but most these birds were obviously first-year birds for whom its not 
worth migrating north in their first year.&nbsp; More surprising though were 
quite a few sightings of apparent adult Barn Swallows in full breeding 
plumage.&nbsp; These were scattered all over the country and were seen on four 
days&nbsp;with up to seven birds seen in one day.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>We recorded 584 species in all - not bad for a 
summer safari when most of the Palearctic species are absent and which did not 
visit any sites southeast of Nairobi.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Thanks are due to Zac Methu for doing all the 
driving and spotting lots of the birds and to Steve Turner and Origins for 
making all the ground arrangements.</FONT></DIV>
