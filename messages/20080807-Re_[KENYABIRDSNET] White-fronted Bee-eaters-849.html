 Thanks to Colin for his thoughts. 
   
 Below is some additional feedback from Tanzania 
which suggests that in fact quite a few of their White-fronted Bee-eaters 
vanished in May as well. 
   
 Its a worrying situation.

airport) 
 Dear David, 
 From what I have seen, and from what Anabel tells 
us, I reckon there was a major exodus in mid May 2008, at least 
from here - the Arusha area; and one that is taking place, to a 
varying extent, each year. 
 I reckon they must go +/- west especially as so 
few have been seen in the Rift in Kenya. 
   
 Best wishes, 
 James

 Dear 
all, 
   
 I am sorry but for different reasons 
I wasn’t able to do any birding around here for most of the month of July, not a 
very nice coincidence to help you with the bee-eaters 
accurately. 
 Looking at my notes and comparing 
them with what I see in the garden these last 2 days is a bit different indeed. 
We have no more than 20 bee-eaters at the moment around while on the 
17 th of May we enjoyed a group of +200 feeding and diving into the 
korongo to their roost. 
 July last year there were days with 
many more, on the 17 th for instance counted +120 on the power 
line. 
 I hope  to be able to go soon 
to the other side of the korongo to check if some have moved there, since I saw 
small groups using other nests on that side in 
June. 
   
 Regards to 
all 
   
 Anabel
