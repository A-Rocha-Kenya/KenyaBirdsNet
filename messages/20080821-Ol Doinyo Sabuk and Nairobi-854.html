Nature Kenya&#8217;s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk saw a Cape Rook in the big field along Ngong Road on the way to the Racecourse on August 13. On August 20, we found Violet-backed Starlings feeding on the (young?) fruits of Croton macrostachyus at the University grounds at the end of Loresho Ridge.<BR>
<BR>
An impromptu camping trip to Ol Doinyo Sabuk with the Nature Kenya Youth Committee recorded interesting birds, although conditions were very dry. The Lead-coloured Flycatcher, that I recorded over 2 years ago, was still singing at the gate. We also saw it swinging its dark, white-edged tail as it moved through the tree canopy. There were three white-morph African Paradise Flycatchers at the campsite, absolutely gorgeous, and Northern Brownbuls snickering from the bushes. Later, Youth Committee members also recorded Hinde&#8217;s Babbler, Red-capped Robin Chat and Eastern Nicator!<BR>

Wishing you good birding, Fleur</SPAN></FONT>
