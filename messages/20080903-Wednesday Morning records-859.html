Nature Kenya's Wednesday Morning Birdwalks have been rich in birds.<BR>
<BR>
On 27 August we saw a Spotted Eagle Owl roosting in a Casuarina tree, and several Banded Martins, in Runda estate; thanks to Narinder Heyer! Also, African Golden Weavers building nests in the wetland at Rosslyn River Garden plant nursery off the Limuru Road. <BR>
<BR>
On 3 September a Barn Swallow was flying over Splash with the swifts. At one of the constructed wetlands, feeding at the water&#8217;s edge and in the cut reeds next to it, was a large, long-billed warbler, all rich rufous in colour. Although the size and shape was right for a Lesser Swamp Warbler, it did not have any white colour on the throat, or anywhere else. Eventually it was joined by 3 others, presumably two adults with whitish throats and another all-rufous-brown juvenile, and we reluctantly agreed that they were all Lesser Swamp Warblers.<BR>

Wishing you good birding, Fleur</SPAN></FONT>
