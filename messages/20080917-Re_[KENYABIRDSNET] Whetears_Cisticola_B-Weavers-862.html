Hi James <br>
About cisticola: while i stayed a couple of month each year in Laikipia i
would concur with you to be right. that Rattling is the most common of
the genus with her chi chi chi....trrrrrrrrrrrr call almost everywhere
near the Ewaso Nyiro and other short-bushed plains. Can also remember
s.sp nakuruensis of Pectoral-patched and some places on west where
Siffling were around.<br><br>
Question now for you. have you ever seen the White-billed Buffalo-Weaver
anywhere in Laikipia (west or east). Someone asked the question of which
i have never seen and don't expect but i also wonder if the population at
Bogoria could one day decide to hike up the escarpment meaning they would
occur in Laikipia?<br><br>
PSS: during our some of the visit there were two records of a single
Black-eared Wheatear at Mpala Ranch so please keep an eye of them
too<br><br>
Many thank James and good birding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; cheers<br>

On September 13th I had my first northern whetear.&nbsp; On the 12th (I
think it was) we had a massive rain in our part of laikipia which was a
releif as we were beginning to feel quite dry. With the rain came three
golden breasted starlings as well as a flock of fischer’s
starlings.&nbsp; These guys live not far to the northeast of us but we
seem to get sightings of them on our higher western ground only at this
time of year.&nbsp; <br><br>
A cisticola question:&nbsp; I have been calling our most common cisticola
here rattling&nbsp; (I have also seen pectoral patch and tiny in the
area).&nbsp; I just wonder about whether rattling should be the most
common cisticola in Laikipia and if I’m putting the wrong name to the
wrong bird . Thanks for any thoughts (we are on the ewaso nyiro river and
east with lots of mixed acacia mellifera habitat and small black cotton
grassy openings.<br><br>
Also, some non bird, camera trap sightings that might be of interest
below. Hope you all are well. Cheers, James
