<DIV>The weather was pretty miserable as was the traffic jam along Magadi Road, and I did not get into the Park until 7-20am. There were two Suni and a perched Common Buzzard on the way in. It was dry when I arrived at the Ivory Site, I tried for the Grey-olive Greenbuls but not a squeak from them, perhaps they have moved on.&nbsp; The only migrants were a Spotted Flycatcher, and a male Montagu’s Harrier quartering the grassland.&nbsp; The light drizzle started and continued for a couple of hours. There was nothing else until the swampy area right by the road at the back of Hyena Dam. African Water Rails were extravert in the now rainy conditions, and two adults and an immature were probing in the short inundated grass well away from cover. Also here were a Common Snipe flying by, two Northern Wheatears and about five Yellow Wagtails.&nbsp; Amazingly Red-collared and Jackson’s Widowbirds are almost in full breeding plumage. This is incredible just
 how rapidly they change, the tails must be growing an inch a day!!!!! White-winged Widowbirds numbers were well down on the past days, and maybe they have left to exploit new areas.&nbsp; Hyena Dam still had Saddle-billed Stork, Great Egret and Squacco Heron, one African Water Rail was wading through the puddle on the main road, and others were calling. A single House Martin was amongst the few Plain Martins. An adult Fish Eagle was hanging around the area, and a Hippo was in the dam. There were a few Green and one Wood Sandpipers. At Nagalomon Dam, there were three Black-crowned Night-Herons were they bred earlier in the year, and four Green Sandpipers. At the base of Impala Lookout, another three Spotted Flycatchers scattered along the road, and six Chestnut Weavers in non-breeding dress.&nbsp; Another African Water Rail was calling at the small marsh on the way to Kingfisher Picnic Site. Here there was a tame African Hoopoe, and just along the road
 from there, an adult Lesser Grey Shrike was a surprise at this time of year, a displaying Black-bellied Bustard, an uncommon wet-season visitor, and an immature Great Spotted Cuckoo of unknown provenance.&nbsp; Following the road towards Olmanyi, there was an immature Lesser Grey Shrike, a territorial Parasitic Weaver singing from a small tree,&nbsp; and another Common Buzzard.<BR>Back at Nagolomon Dam in the evening were a half-dozen Eurasian Bee-eaters and a Eurasian Hobby fling over. Barn Swallows were more prominent in the evening.<BR>Finally there was a Broad-billed Roller in fresh plumage, maybe returning to Madagascar, as there were none to be seen as at my departure from there nine days ago. <BR><BR>On the 24th I met with Mike Davidson, Karen Plum and Fiona Reid for breakfast at Karen Club. Before this we had a walk around the grounds. The weather was overcast and gloomy but it brightened up just before we had breakfast. There was an African
 Water Rail calling from the reeds, some six Tree Pipits were flying over as were two Common Swift, there was one male Blackcap but the best bird was a male Sharpe’s Starling perched on top of a tall tree. There can’t be that many records of this species from Nairobi,.<BR></DIV></div></body></html>
