Dear All,

On 2nd November I went into the Nairobi National Park, only looking at
the northern parts, and staying until 1-00pm. There had been light
rain, but this had not had any dramatic affect on the palearctic
migrants, which were a little disappointing however interesting
afrotropicals are still turning up.
