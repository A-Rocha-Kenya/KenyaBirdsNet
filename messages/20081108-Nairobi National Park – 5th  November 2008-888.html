Dear All,

Another morning (5th November) in Nairobi National Park, at the end of
a short dry period. Migrants were sparse, and yet four species of
migrant chats, Sprosser, Whinchat, Northern and Pied Wheatears were
all singing as if it were a northern spring morning. So evidence still
points to adult birds arriving, and hopefully birds of the year are
still on their way. Compared to recent visits it was disappointing,
however it was still a good morning. More heavy rain should send
another swathe of interesting species our way (hopefully).

At Ivory Burning Site, there were a couple of Nightingales and the
aforementioned noisy Sprosser, three Willow Warblers together and two
Spotted Flycatchers. Whilst the Zanzibar Sombre Greenbul that was
singing near the northwest corner of Nagalomon Dam was not heard
there, one is now singing from dense scrub behind the toilets at Ivory
Burning Site. Just where the strangely placed seat is on the way to
the back of Hyena Dam there was a Nairobi Pipit on the road. The
African Water Rails were visible behind Hyena Dam, whilst at the dam a
Eurasian Marsh Harrier was being mobbed by a migrant Black Kite, the
dwarf Great Egret was still present, and there were singles of Yellow
Wagtail, male Whinchat and two Northern Wheatears. Nagalomon revealed
nothing but a single very pale Common Buzzard.
Kisembe Forest was fairly active, although the only migrants were
single Common Buzzards, a Booted Eagle a Spotted Flycatcher and two
Willow Warblers. There was a female Brown-backed Woodpecker, a Pale
Flycatcher is worth mentioning as it is recorded in the Park very
irregularly, and the Narinas Trogons were calling.
In the Kingfisher Picnic Site area were a couple of Red-tailed
Shrikes, both very scaly, a most attractive male Pied Wheatear, and
two Northern Wheatears. A dozen Eurasian Bee-eaters were flying over
the area. Barn Swallows were in very small numbers, with no
concentrations anywhere. Towards Olmanyi Dam was the first Common
Kestrel of the season (no Lessers yet).  On the way out towards
Langata Gate, there was a pair of Nairobi Pipits along the road,
enabling some video to be taken at long last, sadly, directly through
the windscreen.

We had heavy rain as hoped for during the night, and as we celebrate
Obama Day, I look forward to seeing what has arrived on the local
scene tomorrow.

Best to all

Brian
