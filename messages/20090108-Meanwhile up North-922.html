style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US"><FONT size=3><FONT face=Calibri>We were up in 
Meru National Park and Samburu for a few days around Xmas (24-29/12/2008). All 
these places are probably very well known birdwise, so just a few highlights. We 
used to live in Tanzania where we would send species-lists of squares visited to 
Neil Baker but we are not aware of a similar atlas project in Kenya. If it is of 
any use we can still provide a list with the common stuff also. <?xml:namespace

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US 
style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US"><FONT size=3><FONT face=Calibri>In Meru 
National Park (24-26/12) occasional views of Somali Ostrich. A single Black and 
a single White Stork, a Goliath Heron. Between the Murera gate and Leopard Rock 
on the main road there is quite a large roost of Harriers with over 50 birds, 
spreading out over the grasslands during the day. Most were females cq. 
juveniles but at least one adult male Pallid Harrier was seen as was one female 
with the characteristic facial mask, the rest presumably Montagu’s. A Martial 
Eagle eating probably a Yellow-necked Spurfowl. A lot of Harlequin Quail.

style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US"><FONT size=3><FONT face=Calibri>For those 
worrying about White-throated Bee-eater, there was a bunch of them in every 
suitable tree. This reminds me that when this WTBE scare came out I had just 
come back from Mali (Tombouctou area) in August and there were truckloads of 
them there at the time (and Grasshopper Buzzards every 50 m or so on the new 
grass). The Niger River had its biggest flood since the 1980s so rainfall was 
intense over the Sahel and further south and more WTBE may have gone further 
north than usual. In Meru Blue-cheeked Bee-eater and European Rollers were also 
very abundant (say one in every major tree), a few Broad-billed Roller in the 
strips of gallery forest and an occasional Lilac-breasted. Red-winged Lark 
conveniently singing in tops of bushes. Barn swallows galore, a few Red-tailed 
Shrike, a single Rosy-patched Bush Shrike, a few Eurasian Golden Oriole, big 
groups of Wattled Starling a few males with yellow in the head, Chestnut Weaver 
very abundant.<o:p></o:p></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>

White-backed, an occasional Rüppels. Five Steppe Eagle drinking in the River. A 
pair of Grey-crowned Cranes. Good views of White-bellied and Buff-crested 
Bustard. A thin sprinkling of Common and Wood Sandpiper and Greenshank, a Water 
Thickknee. Numerous slender-tailed Nightjars, White-headed and Blue-naped 
Mousebirds. White-throated Bee-eater again abundant but also some Somali.
