I was going in to Mombasa last Thursday, 15th January at 7.30 a.m. and on the main 
road just the Mombasa side of Ramisi were three Abdim's Storks, they flew off in to 
the open area off the road and I had a very good view of them. This is the first time 
that I have seen Abdim's Storks down here that I can remember.
Still no sign of Spotted Flycatchers and hardly any waders!!
We also have had a Pallid Honeyguide on the bird bath a couple of times between 
Christmas and a couple of days ago. Red capped Robinchats, calling again, but not so 
frequently, and I heard the Fischers Touracos this morning. We are also getting the 
carmine beeeaters hawking overhead and over the Wasin Channel in the very early 
mornings.
