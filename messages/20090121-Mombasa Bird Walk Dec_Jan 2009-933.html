<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dear Birders,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Happy New Year from a windy Mombasa!&nbsp; Dec Bird 
walk was in fact so windy that there were hardly any birds around.&nbsp; Only 
one Greenshank and a few Wood Sandpipers to represent the migrants.&nbsp; 
Several Yellow Billed Egrets, which seem to have made this their favourite 
place.&nbsp; A fairly dismal end to 2008</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Jan walk round Central Quarry, Bamburi, hoping to 
see the Purple Swamphen was much more interesting.&nbsp; Lots of Egrets and 
Herons in very impressive groups, Little, Great White, Yellow Billed and Cattle 
Egrets.&nbsp; Black Headed, Grey and Green Backed Herons and the joy of the 
afternoon a Black Heron, sitting in a tree and showing off his wonderful yellow 
feet.&nbsp; This bird used to be a common sight at this pond but we haven't 
seen&nbsp;one for several years.&nbsp;Unfortunately we did not get to see his 
umbrella fishing! Lots of Scared Ibis glowing in the late afternoon sun.&nbsp;A 
wonderful sight!&nbsp; Long tailed Cormorants galore, the lake is obviously rich 
in fish!&nbsp; All the birds taking to the air in a hurry and although we did 
not see the Great Sparrow Hawk we heard his call.&nbsp; White Faced Whistling 
Ducks and Common Moorhen in their favourite patch of water and two magnificent 
African Darters&nbsp;&nbsp; Less Water Dikkops than usual, maybe they changed 
their stamping ground!&nbsp; Migrants again hardly any.&nbsp; A few Barn 
Swallows flying around&nbsp;but quite a lot of Eurasian Golden Orioles high in 
the Casuarinas.&nbsp;&nbsp;A visit to the football field when leaving to see a 
large flock of Yellow Wagtails.&nbsp; They seem to make it their habitat for the 
whole season every year.&nbsp;&nbsp; We didn't catch up with the Purple Swamphen 
but I am assured that it is still around.&nbsp; Maybe next time!&nbsp; Join us 
if you are in Mombasa. We may be having to start our bird walks somewhat earlier 
some months to go further afield.&nbsp; You can Contact 0720 949195 to 
check!&nbsp;Wishing you all Happy Birding (Marlene 
Reid-Mombasa)</FONT></DIV></BODY></HTML>
