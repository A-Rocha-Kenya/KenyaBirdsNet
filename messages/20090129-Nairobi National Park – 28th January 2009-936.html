Dear All,
I went into Nairobi National Park on 29th January. With the
unpublicised closing of Langata Gate for anything other than Annual
Passes, there is now a bottleneck at the Main Gate entrance, and it
took me a testy twenty minutes to complete the formalities there, and
some people were really losing their cool over the delay. The Aardvark
Holes have reached the stage now of being a very dangerous unmarked
barrier across the entire road, particularly so above the Athi Basin.
Whilst there is so much neglect by KWS on the state of the roads,
which would take so little to rectify, as they are Aardvark
excavations not homes, there is rumour of a success. I heard by word
of mouth that they caught illegal timber cutters in the Ruai area, and
they are in jail.
Notwithstanding, Nairobi Park is still one of the best places in the
country, and today was no exception.
The last two nights there had been reasonable rain, and this has given
a refreshing ambience to the mornings. There are many roadside
puddles, the creeks are flowing, and there seems to have been as much
in the arid south as the northern parts of the Park.
