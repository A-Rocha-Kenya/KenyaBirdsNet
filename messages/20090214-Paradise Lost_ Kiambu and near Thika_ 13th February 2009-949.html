Dear All.

Mike Davidson, Fleur Ng'Weno, Gordon Boy, Karen Plumbe and myself, had
a days outing to Kiambu and on towards Thika. It was unseasonably cool
whilst we were at "Paradise Lost" on the Kiambu road. Our first
interesting birds were a pair of White-backed Duck on one of a series
of dammed stretches of a river. Speke's Weavers were very busy and
noisy constructing their nests not in trees but in bulrushes, a far
cry from being in an acacia adjacent to a bus-stop! There were a
number of birds around these small dams to maintain our interest, even
a dam reduced to a puddle in the centre had one each of Green, Wood
and Common Sandpipers and a Yellow Wagtail. Entering "Paradise Lost"
amounts to Ksh250, but this is well worth the small outlay. We walked
down to a currently non-existent waterfall, and found three very vocal
and vivacious Grey-olive Greenbuls, and watched a number of birds
coming down to drink and bathe in the trickling remnants of the river.
A plethora "it seemed so" of Olive Thrushes were joined by Ruppell's
Robin Chat, Blackcaps and Green-headed Sunbirds. There were Montane
White-eyes performing their ablutions as well, which was interesting
to note, as the surrounding scrub contained Abyssinian White-eyes. In
the scrub there were a couple of secretive Nightingales, and parties
of Grosbeak Weavers, both Black-collared and Grey Apalis were calling.
There was not too much on the large dam, but the surrounds had a few
Tree Pipits under the trees, we saw a pair of Pygmy Kingfishers
courtship feeding, and amongst the good assortment of birds were a
Brown Parisoma and a single Willow Warbler. Whilst walking back to the
parked car, an attractive pale Booted Eagle passed over, but the
biggest surprise came whilst we had our picnic breakfast when an
Osprey flew over carrying a large fish! From here we took the back
roads to Ruiru and looked at a small dam near the Blue Posts. A falcon
came swooping in towards us, just skimming the roof, then seemingly
gathering speed exponentially, flew into a group of trees, and later
flew up and soared over them. An adult African Hobby, any record of
this species in Central Kenya is worthy of note, as they are largely
inexplicably absent in the region. Continuing on to Gacharage we
examined a private estate, but it was now mid-day and pleasantly
warmer. There were fifteen Eurasian Bee-eaters on the wires, a Brown
Snake-Eagle, a Common Buzzard, and in the scrub a Garden Warbler, a
Nightingale and a handsome party of eight Hinde's Babblers.


Fleur asked me to write out a complete list of the species that we
recorded at Paradise Lost, for the management, and I thought it might
be of interest for everybody. It is an interesting area, well worth
the visit.

Best to all
