I am trying to use the kenya bird finder to enter my bird data...
  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.worldbirds.org/kenya">http://www.worldbirds.org/kenya</a> and have just worked out that I can 
also post my trip reports on this site very easily..... just select 
print after you have entered your data and instead of printing,  
select all, copy and then paste in here...et voila! Below is an 
example of a short trip to Champagne ridge last weekend.

Other little bits and pieces are female and young cuckoo shrike in 
our  langata garden..and the buzzard which has been flitting very 
quietly through the forest for the last month or so, not allowing 
itself to be seen is proabably a rufous morph of the steppe(common) 
buzzard. Vereauxs eagle owl was calling again a couple of nights ago.
Having moved the water bath closer to a thick hedge we now have 
turacos, cabanis' greenbul, ruppells robin chats and white eyes 
drinking.

On the road to Namanga, near Ibisil on friday we had Common Rock 
Thrush and white headed roughwings...and although I probably shouldnt 
mention it (being in Tanzania)....whilst looking for the lamergeyer 
(seen again by a friend last weekend) on the shoulder of Mount Meru 
there were 20 Abdims and 5 lesser kestrels.
