Spent a few hours birding on Saturday afternoon in woodland heading from Green Park towards the south of the lake.There was a dead Verreauxs Eagle Owl by the road. Found two others but they were alive and well in a fever tree. We stopped there and had 2 pearl spotted owlets calling and a few other birds attracted in to mob. However, the main reason for this report was the small family of Schalows wheatears we found on the rocky hillside  on our right. Both James and Zackary were confused by the males appearance..the front was all black, including belly! We have photographs but are not sure where to post them. Female and young apeared as normal. Any one see this before?
