<div class="moz-text-flowed">Am briefly in Nairobi and managed to get an hour or so of birding 
squeezed in this morning at the Royal Nairobi Golf Course - mainly alien 
exotic species of trees (and they've been very noble and planted a few 
100 new trees - but 70% of them are again alien exotics! At least there 
are some indigenous trees but there is huge potential for really 
creating some special habitat there...).
<br>
<br>A surprising number of birds but best was excellent views of an Icterine 
Warbler foraging in a grevillea tree and then a eucalypt (didn't have 
much choice in fact!); there were also 2-3 Olivaceous Warblers around 
and certainly 2 Nightingales singing from in bushes as well as several 
Spotted Flycatchers. A pair of Great Spa's are nesting there and an 
adult Harrier Hawk was very noisy carrying food around and I later saw a 
juvenile overhead too.
<br>
<br>Another interesting thing was the number of Af Paradise Flycatchers 
around - I must have seen a good 15 if not 20 of them in a relatively 
small area. Is there a movement of these currently?
