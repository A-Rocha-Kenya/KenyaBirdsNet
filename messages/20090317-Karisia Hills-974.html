<FONT FACE="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><SPAN STYLE='font-size:12.0px'>Hi all,<BR>
<BR>
A recent walk through the Karisia Hills was quite fruitful. &nbsp;Before the safari I thought with the dry conditions that bird activity would not be so great. This wasn&#8217;t the case. Around each spring in the forest the trees were filled with species including:<BR>
<BR>
Chestnut-throated Apalis<BR>
Grey Apalis<BR>
Brown Woodland Warbler<BR>
Olive Thrush (hundreds)<BR>
Northern Double Collared Sunbird<BR>
Collared Sunbird<BR>
Thick-billed Seedeater<BR>
Moustached Green Tinkerbird<BR>
Hartalub&#8217;s Turacos (30 plus often seen in one location)<BR>
Red-fronted Parrots (Flock of 8)<BR>
Dusky Flycatcher<BR>
<BR>
Three species that I have probably overlooked in the forest before were:<BR>
Abyssinian Crimsonwing<BR>
Red-capped Robin chat<BR>
Mountain Greenbul<BR>
<BR>
The Robin Chats as well as various doves (I should have taken closer care in ID but I was watching the Robin chats too closely) and whiskered greenbuls were foraging over a Siafu swarm.<BR>
<BR>
In the south: &nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
Hundreds of fish eagles, vultures and marabous are over the Ewaso Nyiro river now taking advantage of all the marooned fish in the still dry Ewaso Nyiro river. &nbsp;The situation on the Ewaso appears very severe and worrying to me. I concerned about the few hippos left in the system as well as the crocs that must be getting extra harassment with out many places to hide. &nbsp;What also, I wonder, would the local finfoots do in such low water conditions? &nbsp;Otters? The Masai and Samburu in our area are talking about walking up the river and burning every pump they encounter &#8211; In a way I hope they do it.<BR>
<BR>
Another thing: we have had a Golden pipit on our place here in Laikipia for the past few months (I&#8217;m assuming it is the same one). We have never recorded this species here before. Hope your all well.<BR>
<BR>
Cheers, James Christian<BR>
