Nature Kenya's Sunday Birdwatch spent a delightful day on the campus of Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, JKUAT, on April 19 2009, at the kind invitation of Imran Jalakhan and other members of the environmental club. The birds were beautiful, abundant and seemingly unconcerned at the presence of a large and noisy group of people, allowing us close-up views. Some highlights:<BR>
<BR>
A pair of Shikra soaring overhead<BR>
Black and white Cuckoo<BR>
A pair of Grey Woodpecker going in and out nesting hole<BR>
Several Common Whitethroat, passage has been marked this year<BR>
Also Garden and Willow Warblers<BR>
Green-capped Eremomela, close enough to see the yellow eyes<BR>
Young Southern Black Flycatcher begging from adult<BR>
A pair of Spotted Morning Thrush and a pair of Hildebrandt&#8217;s Starling serenading us from a few metres away.<BR>
<BR>
Wishing you good birding, Fleur<BR>
<BR>
PS: Fall of migrants in my Nairobi garden this morning, Great Reed Warbler, Marsh Warbler, Garden Warbler, Common Whitethroat and Red-backed Shrike.<BR>
