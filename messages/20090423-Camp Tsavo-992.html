<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Camp Tsavo (old Taita Discovery Centre):&nbsp; 
Friends of Fort Jesus trip 3rd-5th April</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>An area I have visited several times before, still 
very lovely, excellent accomodation banda style, open air dining room with 
D'Arnaud's Barbets, Red Headed Weavers, Slate Coloured Boubous and others 
mobbing the tables, looking for crumbs etc.&nbsp; An experience I never get 
tired of.&nbsp; The area was very dry and birds not as prolific as I 
remember.&nbsp; Many species not present.&nbsp; Lots of White Bellied Go-away 
Birds whose cross sounding calls typify the bush.&nbsp; Round trhe camp plenty 
of doves, Ring Necked, Red-Eyed, Namaqua, Laughing and Emerald Spotted 
Wood.&nbsp; Von der Deckens, with some Red Billed being resident hornbills. Chin 
Spot Batis, Northern White Crowned Shrike, Red Billed Buffalo and White Headed 
Buffalo Weavers, Spotted Morning Thrush, Yellow Breasted Apalis, Northern 
Brubru, Black Throated Barbet, Hunters, Eastern Violet Backed and Purple Banded 
Sunbirds, Fischers Starling and Vitelline Masked Weavers, a pair of Black Necked 
Weavers visiting the breakfast table on one occasion. Lots more common birds 
around as well.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Driving round the ranch the only birds of prey were 
a single Palid Harrier and a single Montague's, no other birds of prey seen with 
the exception of many Eastern Pale Chanting Goshawk.&nbsp; White Bellied and 
Black Bellied Bustard, some superb Secretary Birds stalking round the grassland 
and a lovely pair of Spotted Thick Knee seen on the road when returning to the 
camp at night.&nbsp; Black Faced Sandgrouse at the water (mostly mud) hole, 
Golden Pipits fairly numerous. White Crested Helmet Shrikes and a brief glimpse 
of Golden Breasted Starlings.&nbsp; Two fantastic Rosy Patched Bush Shrikes, a 
lifer for all the rest of the group.&nbsp; Migrants few and far between:&nbsp; A 
Common Rock Thrush at the tree nursery at Maungu and a female Northern Wheatear 
in the same place on the wire.&nbsp; A splendid Lesser Grey Shrike and lots of 
Barn Swallows still feeding before taking off for northern climes.&nbsp;One 
Willow Warbler seen while the others were elephant watching! &nbsp;A hike up 
Satao Rock still did not yield up Taita Falcon for me but a buffalo gave all of 
us a bit of a surprise!&nbsp;&nbsp;Still&nbsp;have to see that 
falcon!&nbsp;&nbsp; A total of 62 species over 3 days, not&nbsp;nearly as many 
as I recorded on previous visits.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Don't forget about this area, it is a good place to 
stay with wonderful staff and delicious food.&nbsp; (Marlene
