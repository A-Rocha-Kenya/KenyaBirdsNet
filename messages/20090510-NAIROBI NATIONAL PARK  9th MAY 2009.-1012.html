Nigel Hunter kindly transported Fleur Ng'Weno, Leo Haskinen and myself
on a morning in Nairobi National Park.
We entered the Park through the main gate at 6:45am, and made straight
for the Ivory Burning Site. It was very quiet here, there were no
palearctic migrants, and the only bird of any note was a Brown
Parisoma.
Turning the corner along the back road, we were very surprised to see
and hear a Red-faced Cisticola in the roadside scrub. All other
records for the Park have been along the Mbagathi River, and so it was
extraordinary to find one here. In the same place we had our first
Jacobin (Black-and-White) Cuckoo,  five Crested Francolins walking
along the road, and a Nairobi Pipit at the old pumphouse station.
At Hyena Dam, there was an adult Fish-Eagle, the first Spur-winged
Goose for a while, and a couple of Village Weavers in the reeds, (and
a Hippo).
