 Dear Birders, 
   
 A bit late with my news of Msa birdwalk this 
month. 
   
 We went to big brand new golf complex at Vipingo 
Ridge.  It rained for the whole walk which the birds seemed to appreciate 
less than we did with the exception of the White Browed Robin Chats which were 
singing their hearts out in great numbers.  Not many special birds but 
the Lizard Buzzard who sat just a few feet away from us at eye level on a 
spindly tree was pretty good.  Difficult to get a better view and a delight 
to some of the birders who had only seen one from afar.  Interesting to see 
many Barn Swallows and Eurasian Golden Orioles still around. Pintail Whydahs in 
large numbers, males flaunting their long tails.  This is a magnificent 
site, 2500 acres and am convinced that it is a very good potential bird watching 
area once the development settles down.  Views both over the ocean and the 
sea are magnificent and it is several degrees cooler than Mombasa, a blessing in 
itself for both birds and man.  Carry on birding.  Marlene Reid
