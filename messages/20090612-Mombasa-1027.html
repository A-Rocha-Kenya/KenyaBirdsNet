Spent last weekend in Mombasa....hadnt been there in 20 years so it came as a bit of a shock! Woolly necked Stork, Purple, Grey and Black necked Heron were all on the grass by the airport runway..... 
We went to Bamburi and were amazed at the transformation. Birds of note seen were Madagascar Squacco heron, Goliath Heron and Osprey. Next afternoon Marlene and Kelvin kindly accompanied me in Nguuni and we had a great afternoon walking and birding. The shallow ponds had a flock of 20 or so Greenshank, African Darter, African Spoonbill, Three Banded Plover, Great, Yellow Billed and little Egret. Maragascar Squacco and Purple Heron and lots of White Faced Tree Duck. There were Zanzibar red Bishops in various stages of breeding dress. Further on were plenty of Siffling Cisticola and both Yellow Throated and Pangani Longclaws. Bare-eyed thrush were active as it was getting towards dusk, a small flock of Senegal Plover flew over and then the air filed with the churring of many Slender-tailed Nightjars ..one of who came and perched in the low branches of the tree beside us.
