Hi all

We were recently along your coast for a family wedding in Malindi, some differences were of interest.

Northern Carmine Bee-eaters. We only see them from December onwards as post breeding migrants so it was quite a surprise to see several odd birds south of Mombasa. Is this "normal" ? do I assume these were birds that had stayed after over wintering ?

Sooty Tern. We never see them inshore let alone on the beach so it was a delight to watch 5 birds quite close among the tern flock on the Sabaki Estuary. I'm guessing that
the majority of the &gt;2,000 terns were first year Commons but there could have been imm Rosates as well. &lt;100 adult Roseates, all white, no pink flush but bright red legs and bills.
