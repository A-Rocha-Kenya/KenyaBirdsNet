<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>When I checked the records of Common Sand in 
Msa.&nbsp;there was in fact no record for June.&nbsp; Several records in 
July.&nbsp; These records are only from Bird Walks and June is a month that we 
concentrate more on places where there are no migrants so may be not such a 
solid record but supports the view that July birds are early returnees.&nbsp;

  style="FONT-SIZE: 15px">Although I've never seen this species in East Africa 
  in June (i.e., overwintering)<WBR>, I have always thought of it as a very 
  early returning migrant and believed this to be well-known and accepted. 
  Individuals certainly arrive in Kenya in July: I find my first "autumn" record 
  is of one bird on 8 July at Naivasha in 1972 but most of my July records are 
  from 20th onwards.</SPAN></FONT></DIV>
  <DIV><BR></DIV>
  <DIV>
  <DIV>Britton (Birds of East Africa, 1980) and Zimmerman et al. (Birds of Kenya 
  and northern Tanzania, 1996), for arrival dates say,&nbsp;</DIV>
  <DIV><BR></DIV>
  <DIV>". . . being especially numerous from late July to early 
  September.",</DIV>
  <DIV><BR></DIV>
  <DIV>and</DIV>
  <DIV><BR></DIV>
  <DIV>"common and widespread from mid-July . . 
  .",&nbsp;&nbsp;respectively.&nbsp;</DIV>
  <DIV><BR></DIV>
  <DIV>Urban et al. (The Birds of Africa vol 2, 1986) also note, "1st adults 
  penetrate south of the equator by mid-July", so the species' early arrival is 
  well documented.&nbsp;</DIV></DIV>
  <DIV><BR></DIV>
  <DIV>Further, Chapin (Birds of the Belgian Congo, vol 2, 1939) writes (of the 
  Belgian Congo, now DRC), "The astonishingly early arrival of birds from the 
  north has often led to the assumption that they have bred near the equator." 
  He goes on to give July (from 21st) and August records down to 7° S. His 
  remarks make it quite clear, though, that he does not think much of the claims 
  that it has bred in tropical Africa,&nbsp;"Of its nesting in tropical Africa I 
  am still skeptical. The van Somerens have published a photograph taken in 
  Uganda of a bird supposedly sitting on its nest, and Colonel Meinertzhagen, 
  too, reported young common sandpipers with their parents on the Kagiado River 
  in Kenya Colony."&nbsp;Well, now we all know about Col Meinertzhagen and his 
  records . . .</DIV>
  <DIV><BR></DIV>
  <DIV>Many northbound Common Sandpipers caught for ringing in early May carried 
  a lot of fat.</DIV>
