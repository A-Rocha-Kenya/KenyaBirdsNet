<FONT FACE="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><SPAN STYLE='font-size:12.0px'>How interesting. Yes , certainly re-introduction would be a bad idea if the habitat really doesn&#8217;t suit them. &nbsp;I remember Rob Glen, Kerry dad (and serious bird guy) had said that he remembers GHs here. I will ask. Cheers, J<BR>
Have you tried making artificial nests for our other hornbills.? I&#8217;m told they take to Sisal bases hollowed out.<BR>

Actually ground hornbills do not normally occur in most parts of Laikipia. It's been a big question for me (as Tom B. told you, I'm a hornbill fundi and would love to have ground hornbills here) and I'm beginning to think it has something to do with our scrubbiness. &nbsp;GHs are found at equally high altitudes so it's not that variable, and they are found in drier (Samburu) and wetter (Nakuru, Mara, etc.) places, so doesn't seem to be a rain issue either. However, they tend to be found in open, savanna ecosystems where they can hunt their prey more easily. &nbsp;I have asked a number of older Laikipia residents and all noted that they grew up sans GHs (and eles for that matter). Introduction techniques have been developed in SAf, I know the folks well, but it's a big effort and I wouldn't suggest any attempts at introduction into a &nbsp;habitat that seems not to have ever supported them.<BR>

I have been living much of the time in Laikipia for the past ca. 8 years...mostly on Ol Pejeta Conservancy and now on Soita Nyiro Conservancy....as you know. &nbsp;I do not recall ever coming across ground hornbills anywhere in Laikipia. &nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
I am copying this to Drs. Margaret Kinnaird and Tim O'Brian of Mpala Research Centre...as they have a particular interest in hornbills and have been at that site for a few years now. &nbsp;I met with them recently and recall them saying that they had now recorded four species of hornbills on Mpala ... but I do not recall that the ground hornbill was among them.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
I am also copying this email to James Culverwell...who can put you into contact with the 'ground hornbill people of South Africa'.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Regards,<BR>

Dear All,<BR>
A few quick question: Are there any Ground Hornbills left in Laikipia? Has anyone ever read about reintroductions of Ground Hornbills? &nbsp;What would exactly would have been the chief cause of extirpation of Ground Hornbills from Laikipia if they have indeed been extirpated? &nbsp;Where were they once common in the area?<BR>
Thanks for your ideas.<BR>
Cheers, James Christian<BR>
