Hi all,
Ground hornbills in laikipia? i've not seen there. i've spent time in bobong and at lewa i've never seen them, if there's any record i'd like to know where!.

on a different note i would like congratulate the KWS for getting the leadership and  governance practises awards in recently concluded COYA AWARDs, thumbs up to KWS. i've seen kws offer transport and acommodation during waterfowl census every year. 

best regards.

moses

 Hi James, 
   
 I have been living much of the time in Laikipia for the 
past ca. 8 years...mostly on Ol Pejeta Conservancy and now on Soita Nyiro 
Conservancy. ...as you know.  I do not recall ever coming across ground 
hornbills anywhere in Laikipia.  
   
 I am copying this to Drs. Margaret Kinnaird and Tim 
O'Brian of Mpala Research Centre...as they have a particular interest in 
hornbills and have been at that site for a few years now.  I met with them 
recently and recall them saying that they had now recorded four species of 
hornbills on Mpala ... but I do not recall that the ground hornbill was 
among them. 
   
 I am also copying this email to James Culverwell.. .who can put you into 
contact with the 'ground hornbill people of South Africa'. 
   
 Regards, 
   
 Tom

  Dear 
  All, A few quick question: Are there any Ground Hornbills left in Laikipia? 
  Has anyone ever read about reintroductions of Ground Hornbills?  What 
  would exactly would have been the chief cause of extirpation of Ground 
  Hornbills from Laikipia if they have indeed been extirpated?  Where were 
  they once common in the area? Thanks for your ideas. Cheers, James
