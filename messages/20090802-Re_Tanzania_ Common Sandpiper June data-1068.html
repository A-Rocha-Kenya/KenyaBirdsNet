Dear Neil and all,
Thanks so much Neil, for this very useful info on Common Sandpipers.
The distribution of records is certainly widespread, and there is no
coastal bias.  I suppose spanning a period from 1962 until now this
does not represent a high presence, and there are a few records that
could refer to one staying individual, Masek, Ndutu, Ndutu in 2000,
Tarangire, Tarangire in 2000, Masek, Triangle and Ndutu in 2001.  I
would imagine that you would have more contributors in the field at
present, than at any other time during the survey, but still you
haven't had a June Common Sandpiper in the past four years. So I think
that oversummering is an exception and far from the rule. The record
at Lukuba falling in the 11-100 individuals bracket is absolutely
incredible.
I can appreciate the enthusiasm of birders going out in the new year,
we all do it, but even if you take out this reporting bias, will it
reduce records for February by 75%?
I still am waiting to hear of June records from Kenya, no-one has come
up with one as yet, and I personally have not seen one. It is a weird
contrast being such close neighbours.
I was in Nairobi Park yesterday, there were three Little Stints, a
Greenshank, a Green Sandpiper and four Common Sandpipers, every bird
was adult, and I have no doubt that all represented new arrivals to
the continent.
We are still a long way from understanding wader movements, but for
the remainder of this month it is worth everyone taking note of the
age of inland waders, and try and note when the first birds of the
year for each species arrive.

Best to all

Brian
