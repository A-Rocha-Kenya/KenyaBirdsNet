Just back from Uk and delighted to see so many birds in Karengata especially birds of prey. In the last couple of days we have had a Crowned eagle being harried by 2 Harrier Hawks and 2 Pied crows in our garden, also Black Sparrowhawk and Black Kites all very active and calling. There was an immature Augur Buzzard keeping deep within forest cover and a Lizard Buzzard at Karen Golf Course. A large bird party yesterday was active around us for about an hour and included both Lesser Honey Guide and Eatern Honeybird, Black Cuckooshrike, Cabanis and Yellow Whiskered Greenbul and an immature Paradise Flycatcher begging from the male. Montane Nightjars exremely vocal just now. Fiona
