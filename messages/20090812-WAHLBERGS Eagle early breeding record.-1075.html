<div class="moz-text-flowed">many thanks Onesmo, another great obs.
<br>
<br>this is early, we have excellent data from Henning Grossman in Moshi who 
monitored a nest at KCMC for many years. I'll dig this out and repost it.
<br>
<br>I recall an early nest in the East Usambaras that suggested to me that birds 
closer to the equator might not move as far as birds at breeding at higher 
latitudes.
<br>
<br>Nobby, what data for the EU ?
<br>
<br>I recall Oct is the displaying month close to Dar, must send out a new map.
<br>
<br>ANOTHER MIGRANT TO BE AWARE OF AND TO SEND IN ALL RECORDS.
<br>
<br>let's see what we can all put together on the movements of this bird.
<br>
<br>It's known to migrate "in numbers" through the Western Rift along Lake 
Tanganyika. I'll look for the refs, Sept I think is the best month.
<br>
<br>Some excellent sat tagging work on birds breeding in Namibia and moving 
north to Nigeria during their OFF season. again I'll look for the refs.
<br>
<br>Lizanne, please post to the Zambia and Malawi groups.
<br>
<br>look out for displaying and soaring birds, they become far more elusive once 
they are on eggs.
<br>

<br>The first one this season.
<br>A pair of Wahlbergs Eagles have been nesting around the camp for more
<br>than four years.
<br>They go and come back on the same nest
<br>According to my obs. they are early this season.
<br>They arrived today and i saw one carrying building material.
