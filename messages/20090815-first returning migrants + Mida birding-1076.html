<div class="moz-text-flowed">15/8/09 Birding at Mida Creek this morning turned up the first Little 
Stint I've seen for the season here - 16 birds. Also a single 
Sanderling, also my first. Curlew Sands with quite a lot of remains of 
their beautiful 'brick red' breeding plumage also feeding furiously but 
overall wader numbers still quite low. The mangroves and bush along the 
edge were quite active with some stunning African Golden Orioles and a 
feeding flock of Lesser Masked Weavers and bulbuls had three female / 
juv Black Cuckoo-Shrikes which were foraging sometimes on the ground 
which I've not seen very often. African Harrier Hawk, a pair of Great 
Sparrowhawks, a family of Yellow-throated Longclaws, Yellowbill, a 
Woolly-necked Stork overhead and a pair of Pale Batis in the mangroves 
by the A Rocha Kenya boardwalk all added to the morning. As we left the 
site and turned onto the main tarmac road we had four Bohm's Spinetails 
and a Mottled Spinetail over the forest opposite the Mida turning - a 
spot I've often had them.
<br>
<br>Yesterday just near Gede junction I had an Ayre's Hawk Eagle over the 
main road and 10 days ago (6th) as we were doing a crow survey in 
Malindi we had very good views of Bat Hawk chasing the bats as they came 
out of roost.
