 was a scheduled power-out day for us.<BR>We entered the gate at 6:30am and made straight for Ivory Burning<BR>Site.<BR>It was an incredibly beautiful morning, sunny and bright, blue sky but<BR>quite cold, however much more cheerful than it has been of late, and<BR>the birds were obviously pleased with the clear morning.<BR>Apart from the Long-tailed Cormorants and Cattle Egrets leaving their<BR>roosts on Nagalomon Dam, swallows had also roosted there, a few Black<BR>Saw-wings flew into the picnic area from there, and followed by others<BR>until there was a staggering eighty saw-wings. I have never seen such<BR>numbers before, and it would appear that they roosted with the<BR>accompanying Plain Martins in the reeds, this would be a surprise as I<BR>thought they roosted in holes in banks. There were about a dozen<BR>Violet-backed Starlings feeding on a fruiting bush, a party of eight<BR>Red-collared Widowbirds had non-breeding plumaged males with
 almost<BR>fully developed tails and appear to be entering breeding condition<BR>again. There were a number of birds feeding in the clearing, the<BR>biggest surprise being a Somali Bunting. Whether this was the bird<BR>seen at the back of Hyena Dam in the early part of this year isn’t<BR>clear. I have compared photographs with this bird and the last (which<BR>was the first for NNP), and they do look different, but there can be a<BR>lot of plumage change over six months. Another bird that came as a<BR>surprise was a male Black Cuckooshrike, not unusual in itself, but<BR>this bird was a most beautiful shiny blue with a huge bright yellow<BR>shoulder patch. I have only ever seen a very few in Kenya, and have<BR>thought that yellow-shouldered birds originated from the south. The<BR>field-guides don’t mention anything specific as to the provenance of<BR>these beautiful birds (when compared to our all dark birds that we<BR>normally see). Does anyone else
 remember seeing the bird in Kenya, and<BR>at what time of year?<BR>At the back of Hyena Dam there were two African Silverbills bathing,<BR>but there was nothing much at the Dam itself. The run-off was far more<BR>interesting with single Great and Yellow-billed Egrets, a<BR>Lilac-breasted Roller, a single Barn Swallow, the female Whinchat, a<BR>dense flock of 150 Wattled Starings (others seen elsewhere), a few<BR>Zebra Waxbills and plenty of Quailfinch. Near 5A were two Oribi, a<BR>couple of White-tailed Lark that were singing half-heartedly in<BR>flight, and a distant flock of twenty Athi Short-toed Larks. At Karen<BR>Primary School Dam were three Yellow-throated Sandgrouse, three adult<BR>Wood Sandpipers, with a number of Quailfinch Red-billed Quelea and<BR>Yellow-crowned Bishops coming in to drink. At Embakasi Dam very large<BR>numbers of Yellow-crowned Bishops and Red-billed Quelea arriving flock<BR>after flock from the direction of JKA. A Peregrine
 was hunting over<BR>the area making several stoops but not securing anything. Athi Dam was<BR>very disappointing with a single Black-crowned Night-Heron, a pair of<BR>Spur-winged Plover that were not seen to incubate so maybe the eggs<BR>have hatched, adults of&nbsp; Little Stint, two Greenshank and five Common<BR>Sandpipers, all looking like the same birds from earlier in the week.<BR>Nothing noted from here to Kingfisher Picnic Site where there were<BR>four Lilac-breasted Rollers and a Barn Swallow flying through, the<BR>African Jacana was on Kisembe Forest edge Dam and a Nairobi Pipit<BR>along the edge of the forest. We departed through Langata Gate at<BR>2:45pm.<BR><BR>Not much change from Wednesday the last powercut day, still plenty of<BR>cattle in the south, and numerous Zebra and Wildebeeste from Hyena Dam<BR>to Athi Dam. Mammalwise the Park is very impressive.<BR><BR>Best to all<BR><BR>Brian<BR><BR>PS Rupert had a Bat Hawk at dusk over his
 garden (Kisembe<BR>Estate-Langata) on Tuesday evening.<BR></DIV></DIV></DIV></div></body></html>
