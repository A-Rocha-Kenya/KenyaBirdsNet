Good evening to all,

Johan and myself spent the last week-end at the lake Baringo. The weather was really hot and no rain. It was really drough. You will find hereunder the list of the species found, but before I want to report two things.

1. A couple of Lanner Falcon were seen at the cliff and the female was nesting.
