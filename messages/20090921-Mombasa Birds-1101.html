<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>As we had the rare occurence of an RSPB official 
visiting Mombasa we wanted to try to show him a good bird walk so decided on 
Nguuni Wildlife Sanctuary at 6.a.m. on Tuesday Sept 15th.&nbsp; Certain species 
to be counted on and total security at the venue!</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The new wetland has really upgraded this area as 
far as water birds are concerned which makes up for the degredation of the old 
ponds on the farm which have hardly any reed cover due to the voracious 
appetities of the water buck.&nbsp; A lot of the scrub has also disappeared and 
an eye has to be kept out for the giraffes and ostriches.&nbsp; However the 
acacia woodland (which&nbsp;hopefully the giraffes will not totally 
consume)&nbsp;on the way up to the wetland had several Red Capped Robin Chats as 
well as the more commong White Browed plus Eastern Bearded and White Browed 
Scrub Robin.&nbsp; White phase Paradise Flycatcher flitted through the trees and 
there were plenty of Northern Brownbuls and several Pale 
Flycatchers</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The wetland lived up to our best 
expectations.&nbsp; It is now possible to walk round the edge rather than 
viewing the birds from rather far away as before.&nbsp;Long tailed Cormorants 
were numerous, Herons, Purple, Green-backed and Grey.&nbsp; A pair of African 
Darters a juvenile and an adult, a single Open Billed Stork and several Woolly 
Necks which seem to have made this place their haven.&nbsp; Egrets a single 
Great White, Cattle flying over &nbsp;and Little feeding on the pond.&nbsp;On 
the water &nbsp;White Faced Whistling Ducks and one Knob Billed Duck and Little 
Grebes. Very special a male Pygmy Goose and&nbsp;a female Painted Snipe.&nbsp; 
There was an amazing number of Allen's Gallinules, feeding out in the open on 
the mud flats together with a Purple Swamphen, also fully exposed.&nbsp; 
Interesting to see them together.&nbsp; Lots of Water Thick Knees, African 
Jacanas and African Black Crakes.&nbsp; Paul had hoped to see the Lesser Moorhen 
which is around but it did not oblige us.&nbsp; The small group of Spur Wing 
Plovers seem to have taken up residence so hopefully they will eventually breed 
here.&nbsp; Migrants were quite numerous the largest group being Wood Sandpipers 
followed by Greenshanks.&nbsp; A couple of Common Sand, 2 Little Stints and a 
single Marsh Sandpiper (which I think has over-wintered). Plenty of our very own 
Three Banded Plovers - such a great little bird!&nbsp; A Black Shouldered Kite 
flew overhead and there were Malachite and Pied Kingfishers taking breakfast 
from the pond.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>A short walk round the grassland before partaking 
of coffee turned up several Yellow Bills at least 6 or 7 different 
individuals.&nbsp; Considering the skulking nature of this coucal this is 
somewhat unusual but we did once experience this phenomena during an annual 
Birdwatch when we counted about 15 in this same area so not a 'rare' bird 
here.&nbsp; A female Black Cuckoo Shrike, Yellow Throated Longclaw, Bare Eyed 
Thrush and a Village Indigo Bird plus several Pin Tailed Whydahs, males growing 
their long tails brought up the end of the walk.&nbsp; African Golden Palm, 
Grosbeak, Lesser Masked and Village Weavers still busy nesting were to be seen 
thoughout the area.&nbsp; All in all 71 species seen and 4 heard but not 
seen!&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Not a bad morning's birding, for Mombasa that 
is!</FONT></DIV>
