<div class="moz-text-flowed">Hi Claudien and everyone,
<br>I first sent this out on 28/9 but it seems to have got lost.
<br>Since arriving back in Arusha (from Ulaya) August 27 we have seen remarkably few European Bee-eaters (when compared with 2006 &amp; 2007; however 2008 was not so good either) on what used to be a significant bee-eater flyway passing around the shoulder of Mount Meru, across Arusha and then out over the Maasai steppe. Typically in September they are heard/seen in Arusha most often in early evening; as I think they are coming down to roost in coffee plantations and relict riparian woodland; on the western edge of the Arusha urban area.
<br>
<br>By way of contrast Madagascar Bee-eaters have been passing through the "Monduli" gap, (also Arusha) in good numbers; this is what I call the dry corridor of 'lowland' between western Mount Meru &amp; the Monduli mountain block.
<br>
<br>This lack of Europeans is 'corroborated' by our African Morning Thrushes who at the appropriate season repeatedly imitate any highly vocal (especially any fluty-sounding) migrants who might be passing overhead at that time (even nocturnal ones e.g Greenshank which I still 'need' for the garden!).
<br>
<br>Thus: plenty of Madagscar "tree-treeeps" but very few European "pruup-pruups" from the AMTs in these very dusty September days.
<br>
<br>Incidentally there were plenty of Madagascar Bee-eaters 'wired and foraging' over the lush green landscape of TPC Sugar Estate, 40km south of Kilimanjaro, during the Eidd holiday.
<br>
<br>Also, thankfully, we are still seeing small groups (&lt; 10 individuals in each) of White-fronted Bee-eater in the irrigated alfalfa and sports fields of Mringa-Kimemo-Burka estate; and in the adjacent Friedkin-Tanzania Game Trackers recreation grounds (together these form a well-timbered 'green' wedge between the Nairobi and Dodoma roads on the dry west boundary of the town).
<br>
<br>Honey Bee numbers generally seem to be holding well here; it's certainly buzzing around the exotic palms flowering in our wild garden just now.
<br>Neverthelesst it's hardly the Itigi thicket - where it's said the best honey in the world comes from!
<br>
<br>Good Birds 'n all,
<br>James
<br>
<br>PS: There were at least 15 European Bee-eaters today (30/9) at a site near Sanya Juu in West Kilimanjaro. Where also 2 Cinnamon-chested (yesterday) at 1,300m.

<br>Last Friday while I climbed Karisimbi (PNV) we recorded more than 40 individuals of European Bee-eaters and a group of more than 60 Alpine Swift.
