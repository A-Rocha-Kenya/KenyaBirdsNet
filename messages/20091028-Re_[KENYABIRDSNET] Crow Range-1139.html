Can remember once checking my odm on how far they would go. Cant remember
what the last mileage was but at 49km (Mbs-Voi) they were commons on
small towns. I have to check my note book for the last odm reading. <br>

<font size=2>Dear Itai and any birder who may be able to help,<br>
</font>&nbsp;<br>
<font size=2>Dr Colin Ryall who used to be in Mombasa and who nows lives
in UK has just completed a book on the Indian House Crow.&nbsp; He is
trying to update the present range of the crow.&nbsp; I have already sent
a request to Colin Jackson in Watamu so he can communicate the situ there
and how far ranging the crows are at present.&nbsp; The other areas are
Voi (if there is anyone doing a project in that area) and any possible
sightings in Nbi and also how far up the Msa Nbi road they have
travelled.&nbsp; There is also the Shimba Hills, Kwale, Shimoni and
Wasini Island.&nbsp; Any info would be very much appreciated by Colin
whose e-mail is
<a href="mailto:colin.ryall@ntlworld.com">colin.ryall@ntlworld.com</a>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry cannot facilitate this myself as I am rather Mombasa
bound just now.&nbsp; Happy birding or should I say &quot;Happy crowless
birding&quot; <br>
