Dear birders,

On Sunday 8th November 2009, myself, Susan Kung'u and Sameer were visiting a farm down at Lukenya. The farm owner is a friend to Susan. The farm is located on the Mua hill overlooking the Kusyombuguo Guest House. We birdwatched around the farm which is about 80acres and had interesting species. A few to mention: -Red and yellow barbet, Red-fronted barbet, White-headed barbet, Northern Pied barbler, Namaqua dove, Barn swallow, Long-tailed shrike, Speckle-fronted weaver, African  Grey flycatcher, Marico sunbird, Yellow-throated longclaw, Yellow-necked spurfowl,steppe buzzard and a fast flying kestrel. Also unidentified small streaked cisticola unfortunately we didnt take photo.For the short time we birdwatched, the list was over 35 species. 
The farm owner has a nursery of trees and is planting the trees e.g. Palm spps, Croton spps, Prunus spps. His plans is to make the farm a visiting place for relaxing possibly like arboretum. Some interesting trees that are growing naturally Acacia spps, Ficus spps, Euphorbia spps and Erythrina spps.

Great birding,

Joshua
