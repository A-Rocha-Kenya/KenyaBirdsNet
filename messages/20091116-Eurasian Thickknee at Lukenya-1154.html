<BR>
Nature Kenya's Sunday Birdwatch braved the lorry-filled moonscape of the Mombasa Road to spend a delightful day on a private farm on the hills east of Lukenya Hill, just past Kusyombunguo conference centre. There has not been much rain there, the grass was still brown, but tiny wild lilies were struggling to emerge and bloom.<BR>
<BR>
Hightlight of the day was a Eurasian Thickknee, now called Stone-curlew again, &nbsp;in the acacia scrub at the base of the farm on the hills. As we screeched to a halt and jumped out of the car, it hunkered down until it lay flat on the ground and almost invisible.<BR>
<BR>
Other exciting birds included Red-throated Tit at the turnoff to Lukenya; and two Temminck&#8217;s Coursers and a Rufous-crowned Roller at the edge of the farm.<BR>
<BR>
Young fledged birds begging from adults in my Nairobi garden now include Great Sparrowhawk.<BR>
<BR>
Wishing you good birding, Fleur </SPAN></FONT>
