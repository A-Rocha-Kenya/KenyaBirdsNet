<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The walk was in the south quarry of Haller park 
where there are lots of very nice ponds.&nbsp; However as usual no banks with 
wading space&nbsp;have been&nbsp;created and as the water is very deep due to 
recent rain there were no migrant waders,&nbsp;we saw only one Common Sandpiper 
flying by.&nbsp; Strangely there were no Barn Swallows although lots of African 
Palm and Little Swifts.&nbsp; Lots of dudus.&nbsp; Large number of Pied 
Kingfishers catching plenty of small fishes.&nbsp; A couple of Malachite 
Kingfishers in the usual spot. &nbsp;Grey, Black Headed, Green Backed herons and 
a lone Little Egret.&nbsp; Numbers of water birds were very much down on what we 
have seen here before.&nbsp; No Yellow Billed Egrets which are usually fairly 
numerous.&nbsp;Also missing were the usual large numbers of Water Thicknees! 
Golden Palm and Village Weavers were nesting in profusion and the reeds had lots 
of beautiful Grosbeak nests obviously in use.&nbsp; A few White Throated 
Bee-eaters flew over and a couple of Wolly-necked Storks flapped around the 
quarry which is still being worked.&nbsp; The last bird seen was the best of the 
day!&nbsp; A &nbsp;beautiful Long Crested Eagle flew up from the ground onto a 
fence post for us all to see before flying off into the trees no doubt seeking a 
roosting site.&nbsp; Join us if you are in Mombasa - every 3rd Sat of the 
month.&nbsp; Usually meeting at Ratna square at 4 p.m. but sometimes earlier if 
we go further afield so please check! &nbsp; Contact 0720 949195 (Marlene Reid -
