Dear all,

Johan and myself decided to visit NNP on last Saturday. We entered the park at 0700 in the morning. We experienced a lot of rain until 1000Hr.
At Ivory burning site we found 2 Willow Warblers but no Spotted Flycatcher. A Yellow-spotted Petronia is nesting in a tree hole. Nothing of interest at Hyena Dam as the rain continues to fall. A Pallid Harrier was flying over on our way to Splash. The Common Fiscal's chick spotted three weeks ago in the nest is apparently ready to leave it's nest on the Splash road. A lesser Kestrel was seen on the road to Kingfisher picnic site. We stopped on the little bridge going to Kingfisher and we saw a couple African Moustached Warbler carrying nesting material (picture sent to Brian). A common Buzzard was also perched in a tree. A lioness was near Athi basin and a lion near Oloymani Dam. Sorry not to give a report like Brian but as a non English guy, it's a real difficult excercice for me and I don't want to report in French because you will not understand (appart of Brian and Fleur).

On the Sunday, we decided (a bit to late) to visit Dandora ponds. We arrived at 2.30PM. The weather was really hot.... We visited 7 ponds. The most numerous bird was Red-knobbed Coed (more than 1000)and Egyptian Goose (about 200). We also found 2 Water Thick-knee, about 20 Southern Pochard, 4 Northern Shoveler, about 50 Little Grebe, Wood Sandpipers, Green Sandpipers, A dozen of Yellow Wagtails and a single Pangani Longclaw. As we were reaching the car, we heard Parrots shouting but we couldn't see them. We saw a Dideric and a Jacobin Cuckoo in flight.

We will visit NNP on next Sunday. If somebody is interested, he or she is always welcome.

Sorry for the grammatical mistakes.

Best regards,

Patrick
