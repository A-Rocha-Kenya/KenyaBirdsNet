Dear all, 
 
I am a student doing my thesis research in tourism development in Loita forest (also called knows as the South Nguruman IBA). Next to my research I am very interested in birds and since I could not get my hands on a good birdlist for this place I decided to get as many species for a list when I was doing my fieldwork there. The interesting species I saw there are: Brown-headed Apalis (not entirely sure, but it did not have the total white outer tail feathers, African Crowned Eagle, Schalow’s Turaco (many), Hartlaub's Turaco (really big population), White-headed Wood-hoopoe, Golden-tailed Woodpecker, Brown-backed Woodpecker, Bush Pipit, Black-fronted Bush-Shrike, Red-capped Robin-Chat, Abyssinian Ground Thrush, Familiar Chat (no common restart for sure), Wing-snapping Cisticola, Black-throated Apalis, Chestnut-throated Apalis, Brown Parisoma, Red-throated Tit, Black-throated Wattle-eye (many), Waller’s Starling and Abyssinian Crimsonwing. If you
 would like the full list of species I saw or some additional information, feel free to email me. Also if anybody has or knows about a birdlist of south-nguruman, please send it to me.
 
Some weeks ago I spotted two green-backed twinspots in the garden from the compound where I am stying in Kitisuru, Nairobi. I saw them several times, but I am not sure if they are still there currently.
 
Regards, 
Wouter Bol

Thanks for this, Richard - first and last records for migrants are always of interest. The South African Bird Atlas Project #2 has shown that Barn Swallows are arriving later in SA and leaving earlier which is almost certainly due to climate change issues. Prof Les Underhill who heads the Animal Demography Unit at Uni of Cape Town writes:

"For the past four months, since the beginning of August, SABAP2 atlasers 
have engaged in WHAMB (Welcome Home All Migrant Birds). We have done a 
pretty good job of quantifying the timing of arrival of migrants this 
year. In an era of global change, getting a handle on this is very 
important, and very important to do on an annual basis.

To see this, go to the SABAP2 website <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://sabap2">http://sabap2</a>. adu.org,za , go to 
"environmental change" on the left hand side menu, then click on 
"climate change booklet". Go to page 5 of the 16-page booklet, and you 
will find a comparison of the timing of arrival of Barn Swallows in 
Gauteng between SABAP1 and SABAP2. Swallows are leaving us earlier 
(maybe taking advantage of the earlier springs on their breeding grounds 
in Eurasia), and arriving back later (maybe a larger proportion are 
fitting in second broods). Pages 6 and 7 also have SABAP1 vs SABAP2 
comparisons. Paper copies of this booklet are going to all delegates to 
the climate change meeting in Copenhagen next month."Clearly these guys are doing a far wider project that shows arrival and departure dates but even from observers submitting this information, it can provide surprisingly interesting and useful data.

Cape Wagtail -             1  14/11/2009

Willow Warbler-            First recorded on September 19th 2009. Subsequently unto five resident and singing (they usually depart in December)

Cape Rook                   7 passing through on 18th October
Somali Golden-Breasted bunting-  1 seen very well for five minutes on the evening of 17/10/2009- Gone next morning and therefore no photograph (not recorded in Nairobi according to the Bill Harvey checklist).  
 
Good birding to all
 
Richard and Anne
 
PS: We went to Manguo ponds to search for the spotted crake on  the evening of Saturday 31/10/2009. This was three days after it was photographed. Unfortunately we could not find it. The most interesting bird seen was a male painted snipe (a first for us in the Nairobi area).
