Dear All,
I am really fascinated by the correspondence of late concerning Graham
Dangerfields remarkably success story with nest-boxes at Naivasha.
Whilst at this house we are over-run by dogs inside the fence and too
many cats outside of the fence, people with good-sized gardens and
less exotic mammal fauna might wish to put up nest-boxes and as well
as enjoy what comes in to utilise them also report on events. Could
Graham post details of his boxes and advise from where they can be
obtained, as I am sure that there are many who would like to
contribute to his findings. Personally I had no idea that Cape
Robin-Chats for instance would use a nest-box.
Best to all
Brian
