<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Researchers have put up either Sisal, but I think bamboo 'boxes' around Mpala Research Centre.&nbsp;&nbsp;They cut a&nbsp;small entrance hole and blocked off the top and bottom, not sure with what.&nbsp; The biggest problem with nest boxes for any size species is bees, which are difficult to deter.&nbsp; What has happened&nbsp;at Mpala is then the&nbsp;honey hunters come around and destroy the boxes.&nbsp; There's been a number of attempts at Mpala.&nbsp; The first attempt using bamboo boxes was largely unsuccessful, I don't recall anything nesting in them, although&nbsp;an occassional woodpecker&nbsp;could be seen around the&nbsp;entrance hole. The most recent attempts have been to attract starlings, but what I've&nbsp;heard from the team is that the majority of boxes were destroyed by honey hunters.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Some colleagues in Cameroon put up nest boxes for barn owls which were immediately occupied by bees.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>It may be worth a try, but don't have high expectations.</DIV>

<DIV>Further to Brian's queery about Graham's nest box success.&nbsp; I was wondering if many people have had luck with boxes for larger species such as owls or hornbills.&nbsp; I remember someone telling me how they had heard of someone else using sisal plant stems hollowed out to make cavities.&nbsp; This person then supposedly had luck with hornbills occupying his houses.<BR>Has anyone on this list ever made these or other boxes for larger cavity nesters here in Kenya.&nbsp; Back in the states i made many which i put up for barred owls, screech owls, woodpeckers and wood ducks.&nbsp; what about wood owls ? <BR>cheers, James<BR>
