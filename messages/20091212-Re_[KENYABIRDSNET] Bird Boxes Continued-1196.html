<DIV>Hi James,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I suspect that good quality nest holes are a limiting factor for many of 
those species that use/require nest holes.&nbsp; One indication of this is that 
there appears to be great competition among species for good nest holes...birds, 
galagos, anomalures, bees, etc., might all be interested in, and use, a 
particular nest hole.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I have long been surprised at how few people have put up nest boxes for 
birds and mammals in Africa....compared to Europe or North America.&nbsp; In 
Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, SW Uganda, I put up&nbsp;a few 
nest&nbsp;boxes and had a few species use&nbsp;them.&nbsp; Since then, Derek 
Pomeroy and students have done a Stripe-breasted Tit study there...based on data 
obtained from tits nesting in nest boxes that they put up.&nbsp; I do not know 
the details...but&nbsp;I think the results have been good.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Here at Soita Nyiro Wildlife Conservancy (near Mpala Wildlife Conservancy, 
Laikipia) I have put us about 20 nest boxes over the past year...a big variety 
of box sizes, entrance hole sizes...and placements in trees...on and 
buildings.&nbsp; Some would seem to be large enough to accommodate hornbills and 
owls...but no luck as yet.&nbsp; Now, with the drought just ended, some Greater 
Blue-eared Starlings and&nbsp;Superb Starlings have taken to nesting in a few of 
them.&nbsp; One type of 'box'&nbsp;design is completely open on one or two 
sides.&nbsp; One of these&nbsp;is in use by&nbsp;a pair of Yellow-spotted 
Petronias.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I have several books here that are full of nest box designs...for North 
American birds.&nbsp; Some of these designed have been used by me.&nbsp; I think 
we need to play around a lot with box materials, shape and size, hole size, hole 
location on the box, placement of boxes (tree species, heights, directions, 
exposure), etc.&nbsp; Lots of variables to consider.&nbsp; Recording these 
variable for boxes that are both successful and unsuccessful should be 
undertaken so that we have a better handle on what works and does not work for 
the various species...not just birds, but mammals as well...especially 
galagos.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Some of us have staff whom we might not have work for on a full time 
basis.&nbsp; Many such people have the skill to build bird houses from various 
materials that might be around, or which are not&nbsp;very expensive&nbsp;(e.g., 
cypress or pine off-cuts from the nearest lumber yard).&nbsp; Not much in the 
way of tools is required.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I would be interested in knowing the dimensions / design&nbsp;of the 2 or 
3&nbsp;most successful nest boxes that&nbsp;Graham has been using at Naivasha 
and Nairobi.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Regards,&nbsp; Tom</DIV>

  <P>Further to Brian's queery about Graham's nest box success.&nbsp; I was 
  wondering if many people have had luck with boxes for larger species such as 
  owls or hornbills.&nbsp; I remember someone telling me how they had heard of 
  someone else using sisal plant stems hollowed out to make cavities.&nbsp; This 
  person then supposedly had luck with hornbills occupying his houses.<BR>Has 
  anyone on this list ever made these or other boxes for larger cavity nesters 
  here in Kenya.&nbsp; Back in the states i made many which i put up for barred 
  owls, screech owls, woodpeckers and wood ducks.&nbsp; what about wood owls ? 
  <BR>cheers, James<BR>
