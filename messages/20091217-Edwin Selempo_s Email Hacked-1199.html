<div class="moz-text-flowed">Dear all
<br>I'm writing this mail on behalf of Edwin Selempo, an avid birder and 
a member of&nbsp; KenyaBirdsNet, whose yahoo account (Edwin Selempo 
<a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:e.selempo@yahoo.com">&lt;e.selempo@yahoo.com&gt;</a>)has been hacked by unknown person and has been 
used to try to solicit for money claiming that he's stranded in the 
UK.&nbsp; This is NOT true and in deed he is in Nairobi. Please ignore any 
such messages .&nbsp; He is grateful to those of you who've phoned him up 
to inform him.
<br>and he regret the inconveniences caused by the email.
<br>You may reach him via 0720 590 401
<br>
<br>Many thanks and have a MERRY BIRDING XMAS
<br>chege

NOT ACCEPT any mail from yahoo telling you that there is a problem 
with your yahoo account and therefore to give your full names, email 
and password. NO NO NOOO don't
