Greetings all,
We look forward to starting on yet another issue of Kenya Birding.

The production team is growing with professional photographer Paul Benson kindly offering to take the role of photographic editor. Darcy Ogada will continue to provide significant editorial support.

What do we need?

• Letters to the Editor - we'd love to hear what you think of the last issue and how else we can improve

• News - help us choose the best contributions from the <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:kenyabirdsnet@yahoogroups.com">kenyabirdsnet@yahoogroups.com</a> as of July of last year. Do you have a favourite, one you found really interesting or memorable, resend it to me and we will choose those to be reproduced in print.

• Comments or articles  - no more than 350 words

• Other articles - between 600 and 1000 words

• Images - at this point it is hard to say exactly what is needed for different articles, but any stunning cover-material style photo submissions will be most welcome

Do we pay?

No. We were able to provide an honoraria for articles in the second issue of about 3/- per word, but advertising income for issue 3 was not as successful.  We will aim to offer a similar honoraria for this issue, but it is dependent on advertising success.  Hopeful this will not deter you from sending your contribution!

Lastly, if you have ideas or questions that you would like to discuss don't hesitate to reach me on email: <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:catherine@naturekenya.org">catherine@naturekenya.org</a> or office mobiles: 0725 368254 or 0736 432089

What would make my valentines day more special than to receive your wonderful contributions?!

Best regards,
Catherine Ngarachu
