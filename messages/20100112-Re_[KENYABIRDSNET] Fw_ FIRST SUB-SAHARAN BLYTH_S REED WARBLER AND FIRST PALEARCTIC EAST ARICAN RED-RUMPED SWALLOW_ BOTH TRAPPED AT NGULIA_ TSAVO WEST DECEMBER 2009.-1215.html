HI ITAI,
OBVIOUSLY NO-ONE FROM NGULIA IS INTERESTED IN SHARING THE INFO........ SO


FIRST SUB-SAHARAN BLYTH’S REED WARBLER AND FIRST EAST AFRICAN
RED-RUMPED SWALLOW, BOTH TRAPPED AT NGULIA, TSAVO WEST DECEMBER 2009.


Dear All,
The news has not been released by any of the members attached to the
Ngulia Ringing Group, and rather than wait any longer…. There was a
Blyth’s Reed Warbler caught at Ngulia on 19th December. This bird was
well examined (naturally) and relevant images taken. I believe it
represents the first sub-saharan record ever and is a very exciting
record, also of much interest at the same period they caught the first
ever palearctic Red-rumped Swallow recorded in East Africa. The bird
is very distinctive when compared to our local race, with a pale buff
face, and this individual had an almost whitish rump.
The two most exciting Kenyan migrants in 2009.
Best to all
Brian
