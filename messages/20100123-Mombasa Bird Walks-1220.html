<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Bird walk for Dec. was led by Samson&nbsp;our 
helper&nbsp;guide from Haller Park and recorded by Alka Subbarao, a fairly 
recent but very keen birder,&nbsp;so I copy her account, a refreshing 
change.&nbsp; Bird walk was in shale quarry at wetland, Nguu Tatu.</FONT></DIV>

style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Bird Walk Sat Dec. 19<SUP>th</SUP>. <SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN></B>On sat I went for the bird walk - it 
was just Meg, John and me - with Samson guiding us. I took my friend along too 
and it was a wonderful experience for her. The ponds were full so number of 
waders was less but we could see them from very close quarters esp the <B 
style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Thickknees.</B> There were quite a few of 
them;&nbsp;we also&nbsp;got a very good look at a <B 
style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Three-banded Plover</B> and&nbsp;a <B 
style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Spur-winged Plover </B>which were at the 
edge of the water. Another interesting bird we saw was the <B 
style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Allen's Gallinule</B>. At that time we 
identified it as a <B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Purple Swamhen</B> 
but when I had a good look at my book I thought it must have been a Gallinule as 
it had turquoise on its head. We also spotted a <B 
style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Common Moorhen, White-browed Coucal, Little 
Swifts, Grosbeak and Golden Palm weavers, Barn Swallows </B>were plenty<B 
style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">. Flocks of Yellow-billed Stork and Sacred 
Ibis</B> looking beautitiful in flight. There was a pretty lone&nbsp;<B 
style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Malachite Kingfisher</B>, a lone<B 
style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"> Grey Heron</B>, a couple of <B 
style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Woolly-necked Storks, Zanzibar Red Bishop, 
Long-tailed Cormorant, Red-billed Quelea,&nbsp;Cattle Egret, Common Bulbu</B>l 
and to our surprise <B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Yellow wagtails</B> 
perched on&nbsp;acacia trees<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I have 
always seen them on the ground so I did not know that they also perched on 
trees. (Alka Subbarao)</P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><FONT face=Arial size=2>This area 
is drier than I have ever seen it but still with quite a lot of water in the 
large pond.&nbsp; There were hardly any grassland birds but plenty to see at the 
pond.&nbsp; On arrival overhead a fairly large group of Yellow Billed 
Storks.&nbsp; In the reeds and flying around about 6 Common Squacco Herons, a 
rare treat these days.&nbsp;Lots of Zanzibar Bishops. &nbsp;Long Tailed 
Cormorants fishing, 2 beautiful Purple Swamphens (we keep hoping they will breed 
here), African Jacana, African Black Crake, Yellow Billed and Cattle Egrets, 
Pink Backed Pelican flying by, many White Faced Whistling Ducks and Egyptian 
Geese, Three Banded Plover, Malachite Kingfisher.&nbsp; Migrants 
were&nbsp;absent except for a Common Sandpiper.&nbsp; Not even Barn Swallows 
around.&nbsp; A dearth this year of Spotted flycatchers! &nbsp;On the way back 
to the cars over the degraded grassland, a Red Faced Crombec, a pair of Black 
Headed Batis and a Flappet Lark.&nbsp; (30 species seen in all)</FONT></P>

Mombasa Birding of Note:</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><FONT face=Arial size=2>Two stays 
at Tiwi beach - hardly any migrant waders, only one or two Greenshanks, several 
Whimbrels and Grey Plovers.&nbsp; A large group of Saunders Terns with a couple 
of Common Terns and a small group of Ruddy Turnstones.&nbsp; In the far distance 
a flock of small waders which were probably Sandplovers but was too far away to 
be sure.</FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><FONT face=Arial size=2>Jumba 
Beach - again not many waders Whimbrels and Grey Plovers being the main 
ones.&nbsp; One small flock which I think were Curlew Sandpipers but again very 
swift and fairly far.&nbsp; This beach used to be alive with Curlew Sandpipers - 
where have they all gone?</FONT></P>
