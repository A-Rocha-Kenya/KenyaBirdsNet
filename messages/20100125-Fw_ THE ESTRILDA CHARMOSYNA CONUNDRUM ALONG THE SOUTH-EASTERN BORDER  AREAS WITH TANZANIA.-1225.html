It is
 common around Nairobi all down to the Tanzanian<BR>border (?), and likewise the distribution extends over the southern<BR>border into the Maasai Mara and Tsavo (?).<BR>Originally the two birds were treated as races of the same species,<BR>although they were separated a long time ago now, but is it possible<BR>that the complex includes a third species!?<BR><BR>I have attached photographs of charmosyna from Kongelai in NW Kenya,<BR>Haberswein in NE Kenya, and Samburu in E Kenya. The most marked thing<BR>about these birds when encountered is that they are so pale by<BR>comparison with erythronotus, and lack red on belly and flanks,<BR>although there is a pink tinge. So that when the birds are illustrated<BR>from&nbsp; south of the equator towards the Tanzanian border areas of Tsavo<BR>and Magadi Road, they are illustrated with the same dark plumage as<BR>erythronotus. It is this that had led me (up to now) to think that<BR>these records of charmosyna in
 southern Kenya have been mis-identified<BR>or seen badly. As the colouration of the eastern/northern charmosyna<BR>is so very different.<BR><BR>Having just visited Tsavo this past weekend, we located some waxbills<BR>at Sagala Lodge and took photographs of the birds that were inhabiting<BR>the Commiphora/Delonix/Acacia woodland. We were struggling to see a<BR>black throat, on what looked superficially like erythronotus, and try<BR>as we might, whilst the birds had a thin black line across the throat<BR>at the base of the bill, the throat was pale. The birds were fairly<BR>common (especially at owl-mobs), and once captivated by the presence<BR>of an owlet remained confined to a small area and were easier to<BR>study. As far as I know charmosyna is not recorded for Tanzania, but<BR>this form must be found in the contiguous habitat that crosses the<BR>border. (?)<BR><BR>I have attached an image of the typical erythronotus from Nairobi. The<BR>black throat
 is very extensive and obvious, this is bordered by a<BR>narrow whitish band that borders the lower part of the face patch and<BR>continues across the throat. Overall the bird is dark toned, the<BR>underparts reddish tinged grey across the belly and upper chest, a<BR>deeper red band across the lower breast, striking red flanks, and<BR>blackish lower belly to crissum.<BR>A comparison of the photograph charmosyna (?)&nbsp; attached, that comes<BR>from Sagala Lodge last Saturday, leads to many differences. The face<BR>is black, but the throat is greyish, the birds share the white border<BR>to the black face but this is restricted to the lower edge of the<BR>face, but is absent on the black edge that borders the throat. The<BR>underparts lack red, mainly buffy-grey on the upper chest, shading to<BR>warm buff on the belly becoming paler towards the crissum. There are<BR>no striking red-flanks. Above the two birds are very similar.<BR><BR>Checking the
 illustrations in Stevenson and Fanshawe, it became very<BR>evident, that the erythronotus painting is incredibly awful, and not<BR>looking anything like a Kenyan member of the species. The extent of<BR>the black on the throat is virtually identical here in erythronotus<BR>and charmosyna, and this poor representation will only lead to<BR>confusion for anyone attempting to identify the species. The only<BR>difference shown is dark as opposed to pale lower belly to undertail<BR>coverts, and a subtle difference in flank colouration. I then examined<BR>Zimmermann and Turner, where the differences were much better<BR>illustrated, having used a bird resembling northern pale charmosyna,<BR>although again the erythronotus isn’t very impressive as regards to<BR>accuracy in colour it does at least show the extent of the black<BR>throat.<BR><BR>Comparing my photographs of typical northern and eastern charmosyna<BR>with these southern birds, many features are
 shared, absence of red on<BR>chest and flanks, both with paler underparts than erythronotus, and<BR>paler lower belly to undertail coverts, but the northern and eastern<BR>birds show a very contrasting white throat and white forehead, as<BR>opposed to greyish. They do not show any black line across the throat<BR>at the base of the bill unlike the noticeable narrow black line of<BR>southern charmosyna (?). Their lower belly/undertail coverts region is<BR>much whiter, and overall the ground colouration is much paler.<BR>Southern birds are robust and dark-hued, not as dark as erythronotus,<BR>but nothing as pale as northern and eastern charmosyna, which also<BR>appear smaller, and much slighter and delicate in the field. The<BR>general appearance of southern charmosyna (?) is almost as robust as<BR>erythronotus.<BR><BR>There is obviously a lot to learn about these three forms in Kenya,<BR>the southern form of charmosyna (?) having never been
 described.&nbsp; With<BR>the claim that dark charmosyna have occurred sympatrically with<BR>erythronotus on the Magadi road, such studies can start on our<BR>doorstep!<BR>This is only a preliminary “wake-up” to make birders aware of the<BR>interesting situation, wherever there is a “?”&nbsp; it means that now we<BR>need confirmation of the record.<BR>I have attached a selection of photographs of charmosyna from various<BR>locations, I apologise for the standard, but they all tell the story.<BR>It would be of interest if everyone could dig out their&nbsp; erythronotus<BR>and charmosyna photographs and see what they have.<BR>Please look carefully at all of the Black-faced/cheeked Waxbills met<BR>with in this country, and in border areas with Tanzania, and report on<BR>what form is where, and especially if there is any area of sympatry.<BR><BR>Best to all<BR>Brian<BR></DIV></DIV></DIV><!-- cg14.c2.mail.re1.yahoo.com compressed/chunked Fri Jan 15
