<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt" class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><FONT size=3>Dear colleagues,<BR>Happy New Year to all of you! I wish you a healthy and successful year!<BR>I am writing to you in regard to the expedition in Ethiopia which we conducted together with the Ethiopian Wildlife and Natural History Society.<BR>On the BSPB website you can see the link with the results and pictures from the expedition:<BR></FONT><A href="http://bspb.org/show2.php?id=1408&amp;menu_id=33"><FONT color=#800080 size=3>http://bspb.org/show2.php?id=1408&amp;menu_id=33</FONT></A><FONT size=3> (if the link opens in Bulgarian click on the English language icon on the upper right side of the website and then you will see the news).<BR>In summary we counted 1424 Egyptian Vultures and now population estimation for the Afar region of 1600-1700 birds seems reasonable and even probably underestimation. We also revealed the distribution
 pattern and habitat preferences, recorded the age structure which will allow approximate estimation of the survival of the different age classes, collected data on the threats, foraging and roosting behavior. It also turned out that the area is not of significant importance for the Bulgarian and probably Balkan population but nevertheless it is still the most important area for the EVs in East Africa and in possibly in whole Africa and thus a highly important site from conservation point of view.<BR>At present it seems that the Afar triangle is quite safe area for the wintering Egyptian vultures but comparison with data from 1994 and 2000 shows decline. The increasing use of poisons against carnivores in Kenya and recently in South Ethiopia undoubtedly had and will continue to have negative influence over the Egyptian vulture and all vultures populations. With the continuation and geographical spread of the illegal poisoning the vultures will continue
 to suffer and this can lead their population to total devastation.<BR>I think that we all are obliged to continue this good start with the Egyptian vulture work. I personally will be very keen to help with whatever I can. During the expedition we discussed with Yilma Dellelegn about the future development and submission of project to Rufford Small Grants Foundation, which can be proposed by Yilma personally or by him but through the EWNHS. I believe we have to make this step and to me the most urgent draft aims and actions for inclusion in such initial project should be: <BR>Aims:<BR>1) To reveal the global importance of Ethiopia for the Palearctic wintering population of the Egyptian Vulture;<BR>2) To allow future planning and implementation of adequate conservation measures;<BR>3) To increase the awareness of the local people and authorities on the huge importance of their regions for the world preservation of the species;<BR>4) To build capacity for
 future vulture conservation work in Ethiopia;<BR>Actions: <BR>1) Survey in South Ethiopia around Negele and also west of lake Tana along the Sudan border to estimate the wintering population number and threats for the EV there; <BR>2) Collecting of information on the "predator-man" conflict regarding the possible use of poisons; <BR>3) Raising of awareness on the problem among the relevant authorities and creating of partnerships (meetings, distribution of printed poster for the Egyptian vulture, lectures, presentations); <BR>4) Education and training of volunteers (Bruktawit Abdu and some local students from the wintering areas); <BR>I hope that you find the above mentioned aims and actions reasonable and I will be happy to help with everything I can in the project drafting and any information.<BR>Finally I think that we all did a good starting job and we can wish ourselves motivation and belief in the good ideas that we are pursuing!<BR>Best
 wishes!<BR>Ivo<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P></DIV>

<P>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>this bird is now more or less extirpated from southern Africa so our northern population and that of Kenya is on the southern edge of the range.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>there is renewed interest in Europe on the fate of this bird with expeditions to Ethiopia in recent years (copies please if anyone has these) to see what is happening to the quite large population there.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>I've sent out this map and graph before but not the full data.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>No records from anyone for last year ? can this be true, none of u northern birders seeing this bird ? not even in the Serengeti or Natron Rift ?</FONT>&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face=Arial>Matt, no records at all during your 18 months or so at Makat ? Books not with me at the mo but I recall 17 bathing in the Ngare Sero river in 2002.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>What's the story in Kenya with this bird ? any surveys ?</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>All records much appreciated. We will loose this bird soon and it's unlikely we can do anything about it but WHY ? any ideas anyone ?</FONT></DIV>
