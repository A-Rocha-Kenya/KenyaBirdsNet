<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" ><tr><td valign="top" style="font: inherit;">Hello to you All.<br><br>Attached above is a photo I took of a young <br>Red chested Cuckoo during yesterday`s ( Wednesday ) Nature <br>Kenya birdwalk at a place in Karen.While I was adjusting my camera settings <br>to take this shot I saw a Ruppell`s robin Chat fly and perch next to the young Cuckoo <br>and gave it something ( an insect of some sort )&nbsp; to eat ! If you look closely enough you`ll see something sticking out of the Cuckoo`s beak.When I was about to take the shot of both birds together the Robin Chat did`nt give me the chance but flew away and what I managed to capture was the Cuckoo with the food in its mouth.There was an adult Red chested Cuckoo calling at a distance .....presumably it could have been the mother....just a thought.Is this a common phenomena with these two species ? <br><br>Kind regards<br><br>Peter Wairasho&nbsp; &nbsp;
