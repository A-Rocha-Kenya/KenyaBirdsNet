Just back from a trip to Tsavo (more on those birds later) and we took the back road from the Ulu hills into Kajiado. About 5 minutes from Kajiado towards Isinye there is a large pond and all round and above us were thousands of storks. We did an extimate but it was very difficult as the hilsides were literally coved in white storks and marabous,and there were  huge flocks above us and off into the distance.
Marabous were in their hundreds..possibly as many as a thousand.
Abdims we reckoned about four thousand and white storks 2-3 thousand. What a sight!
