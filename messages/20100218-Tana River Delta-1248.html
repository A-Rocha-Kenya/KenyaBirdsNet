Just back from the Tana River Delta and waterbird counts there. Water
levels in the river were very low compared to the previous four years
that we've done it and this was reflected in the lack of crakes and
rails and very few herons and even waders. However we did have a count
of over 2,500 Caspian Plovers together on some mud flats. Zimmerman
states (and my experience supported this) that it is 'scarce on the
coast' - but certainly not the case at Tana! The other interesting
observation was a flock of 80 Pacific Golden Plover not far from the
Caspians and the next day on the estuary about 25km away a flock of 110
(right next to the Delta Dunes Camp in fact - who once again very
kindly supported the count wonderfully with provision of accommodation
and transport). This is similar to what we saw two years ago and in
fact most years we've seen reasonable numbers of this species which
makes me think this is probably a distinct population of PGPs that
winter just at Tana. Given that we only survey less than 15%, and
probably less than 10% of the delta, there may well be over 2,000 of
these birds across the whole delta, possibly more. The flock of 57 in
December 1985 as reported in Zimmerman probably is <i>not</i>
'exceptional' as given, but the norm for this site.<br>
<br>
Other than that, a Sandwich Tern again on the estuary mouth next to
Delta Dunes Camp, a couple of Rufous Bush Chats and a Pallid Harrier
were migrants of note. Five White-backed Vultures were probably feeding
on the carcasses of the cattle that die there - thousands and thousands
of cattle on the delta plains, <i>right</i> where Mumias is planning
to put in its 50,000ha of sugarcane to 'help the local community'.
Nubian Woodpecker was very vocal around the Dunes Camp which is
literally right on the beach - interesting as we don't find it at all
around Watamu or Arabuko-Sokoke, let alone right down by the beach. <br>
<br>
An awesome place as ever to visit as a birder and a privilege to see it
before it gets too badly changed. We need to support all the
initiatives to protect what surely must be Kenya's no.1 fresh water
wetland site but that is so hugely under watched and unknown. Again the
Delta Dunes Camp is working with the community to try and get it
protected as are NatureKenya who are doing a good job at it and need
all the support we can give them. For more information about the delta
there's information on <a href="http://www.tanariverdelta.org">www.tanariverdelta.org</a>
