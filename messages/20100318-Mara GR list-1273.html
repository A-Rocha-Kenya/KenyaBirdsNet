<p class="MsoNormal">Dear <st1><st1>Kenya</st1></st1>
Birders,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o>&nbsp;</o></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My name is Adam Kennedy and I‚Äôd like to take this
opportunity to introduce myself to the group as the new manager of Naibor Camp
(along with my wife Vicki) in the heart of the Mara GR.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o>&nbsp;</o></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I‚Äôve been birding from a young age and Vicki and I have just
completed two wonderful years managing camps in southern Tanzania (in Mikumi,
Ruaha and Katavi NPs) and will now be based in the Mara for at least a couple
of years. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o>&nbsp;</o></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I am very keen to organize an up to date Mara bird list (for
the group, myself and my guides) and have drafted a spreadsheet
which I am hoping many of you will be able to contribute towards (Itai - if I send it to you, will you post it online for the group?). Although the
Mara ecosystem is extensive, I have tried to keep the geographical parameters
to include the Mara GR and nearby conservancies and escarpments but NOT
reaching as far as the Mau forest or Loita Hills, for example. Once I get to
know the area better, I shall try to map the precise region that the list will
cover. I have used the very useful Governor‚Äôs Camp (GC) Mara list (compiled by
Dave Richards) as my primary source of information, plus the species accounts
and maps of <i>Zimmerman, Turner &amp;
Pearson </i>as my second. I‚Äôve then added some further records that Itai has
made me aware of (such as Rufous-tailed Weaver and Karamoja Apalis) and finally
a trip report by Brian Finch (Rockjumper 2009) where I have taken recent records
such as Red-winged Francolin. There are four types of entry on this list;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o>&nbsp;</o></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>1. Fork-tailed Drongo
‚Ä" black and bold. </b>Good records that one would expect from the area, plus
species recorded by Brian on the Rockjumper trip report.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><o>&nbsp;</o></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>2. African
Silverbill? ‚Ä" black and bold <u>with question mark</u>.</b> Records on the GC
Mara list that might possibly be erroneous or simply subject to typesetting
errors (e.g. Tawny Eagle is not on this list!)<b><o></o></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><o>&nbsp;</o></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>3.</b><span style="color: red;"> Dusky Nightjar </span>‚Ä" red and NOT bold. Birds that I feel
could well have been recorded in the Mara but are not on the GC Mara list or
specified in Zimmerman et al.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o>&nbsp;</o></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>4.</b> Pennant-winged
Nightjar ‚Ä" black and NOT bold. Not listed on either GC Mara list, Rockjumper
trip report or clearly recorded in Zimmerman. These are the ‚Äúoutsiders‚Äù and may
not have been recorded in the Mara in the past but which could in theory be
present or recorded as vagrants.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o>&nbsp;</o></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(Further, I have also marked the Plain-backed &amp; Buffy
Pipits in <span style="color: blue;">blue </span>and I shall be asking the fundis
to explain the current status of these species in the Mara via the group.)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o>&nbsp;</o></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I would be very grateful if you would give this list a good
grilling and let me know of any obvious errors and any good records you may
have that do not appear on the list. If you can confirm records of any species
in that fall in the 2, 3 and 4 categories, I would greatly appreciate it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o>&nbsp;</o></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Brian ‚Ä" Itai mentioned that you compiled a list in the Nature
Kenya guidebook to the Maasai Mara National Reserve (3rd edition). Do you by
any chance have an electronic version of this list that you can send my way so
I can include/ update the records in the spreadsheet? Thanks.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o>&nbsp;</o></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If any of the members of the group are considering a trip
into the Mara for some birding, please drop me a line as I am always looking
for an excuse for extra-curricular birding. Also, if anyone is interested in
staying at Naibor (see our camp at <a href="http://www.naibor.com/">www.naibor.com</a>
) please let me know and I can help to arrange your bookings. Our resident
rates are quite competitive. The camp email is <a href="mailto:info@naibor.com">info@naibor.com</a>
and my mobile is 0718 203032.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o>&nbsp;</o></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Finally, are there any other birders (maybe camp managers?)
based in the Mara at the moment? If so, please drop me a line and we can
compare notes over a cold Tusker!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o>&nbsp;</o></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Many thanks and best wishes,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o>&nbsp;</o></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Adam Scott Kennedy</p>
