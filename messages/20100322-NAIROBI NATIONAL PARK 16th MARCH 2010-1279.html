Dear All,
I had a morning in Nairobi National Park, but only looked at the
northern parts. Firstly Ivory Burning Site was interesting with six or
so Nightingales, a very pale Spotted Flycatcher, several Olivaceous
Warblers, four Barred including a very nice adult male, a couple each
of Garden and Whitethroat and one female Blackcap. At the back of
Hyena Dam was a Squacco Heron, and it or another at the dam itself. An
African Water Rail called from cover and there was a Sedge Warbler in
the reeds but little else. On the run-off were a Yellow-billed Egret,
a few Lesser Kestrels, a couple of Whinchat, three Red-tail and one
Red-backed Shrikes, and six Yellow-crowned Bishops amongst the usual
Jackson's and Red-collared Widowbirds. There were a scattering of
Quailfinch and a few Barn Swallows.
Olmanyi Dam had a Sedge Warbler, whilst on the road across to
Kingfisher there were five Eurasian Rollers, over a dozen Lesser
Kestrels, at least seven Rosy-breasted Longclaws, an Isabelline
Wheatear and a couple of Parasitic Weavers. At Kingfisher was the only
Willow Warbler of the day, a Greater Blue-eared Starling and nearby a
male Saddle-billed Stork and another Whinchat. Driving through Kisembe
Forest there were two Common Buzzards, and as well as the Forest Edge
Dam and Langata Dam having incubating Crowned Cranes, another bird was
incubating in the Kisembe Valley. On the Langata Dam were two adult
Little Grebes each tending precocial chicks, on a seasonal pool in the
Kisembe Valley was another adult wih a chick, and on the way to the
Langata Gate from here were a dozen Eurasian Bee-eaters, a couple of
Tree Pipits and eight Black-and-White Mannikins.

On the 19th March I went into IUCN which is next door to where I live.
I was looking for butterflies, there were 46 species flying which is
not quite as rich as I was hoping, but a few more Skipper and Blue
species are emerging. There was a lot of scolding and on "spishing" I
called in a group of Placid Greenbuls and a Paradise Flycatcher, but
most interestingly a female Black-throated Wattle-eye, This was the
first I had seen here, although a few months ago found a pair on Hog
Ranch. Although only on the other side of the road from Nairobi
National Park, there has never been a record from here. A couple of
pairs of Grey Apalis were also very noisy, and another species as yet
unrecorded from NNP.
