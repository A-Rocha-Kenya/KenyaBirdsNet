I was wondering if you<BR>could give me your ten cents worth as to what you think it could be, I<BR>have my ideas! Can you put it on the net, or send to anyone else who<BR>might have experience with northern phylloscs. Looking forward to<BR>hearing of your trip, I bet I would have had stacks of liers. I have<BR>posted latest observations separately,<BR>Hope you are all well,<BR>Brian<BR><BR>“Can
 anybody shed any light on this observation please. I am somewhat<BR>confused as to the identification of a phylloscopus in Nairobi<BR>National Park on 20th March 2010. I have an idea of what it might be,<BR>but it is rather outrageous though not impossible.<BR>I was with Patrick Lhoir and his father, we were at the Hippo Pools<BR>and there were a few migrant warblers in the area. In the canopy of a<BR>medium-sized acacia we located a rather chunky Phylloscopus but it was<BR>difficult to judge size without any other birds for a direct<BR>comparison, however it looked larger than any Willow Warbler we had<BR>been looking at (including one minute prior to the observation and a<BR>minute after it). I could see through the vegetation that the bird was<BR>pure white underneath and said that it must be a Wood Warbler. As the<BR>bird emerged from cover we could see that the bird lacked any yellow<BR>on the throat and breast and this too was snow white. Knowing
 that<BR>there have been Wood Warblers that lack the yellow I still thought<BR>that this bird could only be a Wood Warbler. We took video and images<BR>of the bird, but clearly the tail is too long for a Wood, being more<BR>similarly proportioned to a Willow.<BR>Examination of the images shows some other features, not associated<BR>with migrant phylloscopus to the region. The most noticeable feature<BR>apart from the all white underparts was the striking head pattern. The<BR>upper parts were not seen well as for most of the time the bird was<BR>almost directly overhead, but appeared a fairly bright olive-green,<BR>brighter than most Willow Warblers that we encounter here and darker<BR>than Wood Warbler. The top of the head was also olive-green. Under<BR>this was a very pale yellow sweeping supercilium extending from the<BR>base of the bill back to near the start of the nape. An equally long<BR>and striking dark line ran from the back of the eye, as far
 as the<BR>sides of the nape, whilst in front of the eye this continued to the<BR>base of the bill with a more greenish tinge. As a continuous line this<BR>ran underneath the white supercilium for its entire length. Underneath<BR>the black supercilium was a shorter whitish line running from just<BR>under the leading edge of the eye, back to the side of the nape, and<BR>below this a shadowy crescentic line of similar length. The bill was<BR>dark on the ridge of the upper mandible, paler brown on the sides and<BR>lower mandible with a yellowish base and dark tip. The underside of<BR>the lower mandible was brighter yellow as was the mouth lining,<BR>however the bill appeared black against backlight. The bill appeared<BR>shorter than Willow Warbler. The eye was brownish, but appeared dark<BR>in the field. There was a narrow pale crescent below the lower eyelid.<BR>The underparts from chin to extremity of undertail coverts were pure<BR>white, but although not
 noted in the field, the image close-ups show<BR>faint and diffuse longitudinal darker streaking. The undertail coverts<BR>were long, but there was still substantial amount of tail protruding<BR>unlike a Wood Warbler. The legs were pale pinkish-flesh, possibly<BR>slightly paler than a Willow Warbler. The images show a whitish<BR>translucency all around the extremities of the tail which was quite<BR>deeply notched.. The bend of the wing looks yellow and in one image a<BR>slightly raised wing shows the underwing as appearing lemon-yellow.<BR>The movements through the vegetation were quite sluggish, there was no<BR>noticeable tail or wing flicking, and the bird gleaned from the acacia<BR>twigs. After we had studied this bird for several minutes it flew off<BR>but did not seem to go any great distance.<BR>The upper images are grabs from the video to show different features,<BR>the remainder a selection of images.”<BR></DIV></DIV></DIV></div></body></html>
