Dear all,<br>
<br>
As indicated/threatened elsewhere earlier this week I've prepared
 a blog post at my Crikey blog, <a href="http://blogs.crikey.com.au/northern/2010/03/31/birdwatchers-terrorists-criminals/" target="_blank">The Northern Myth</a>, based on the original post and 
the responses to the unfortunate incident that a female birder in 
Queensland, Australia had with one of the local coppers.<br>

<br>
I've collected a few of the posts together and have thrown a few 
comments and thoughts of my own in - hopefully we can continue and 
broaden this discussion. I haven't identified any of the posters to 
Birding-Aus by name.<br>
<br>
Since I posted this last evening I've had a lot of funny - and 
not-so-funny - responses, mainly from the US and Australia - so I 
thought I'd throw it out a bit wider to see what sort of experiences 
birders (and bird photographers) have had in other parts of the world.<br>

<br>
You can read the blog post here: <a href="http://blogs.crikey.com.au/northern/2010/03/31/birdwatchers-terrorists-criminals/" target="_blank">http://blogs.crikey.com.au/<wbr>northern/2010/03/31/<wbr>birdwatchers-terrorists-<wbr>criminals/</a> - please take the time to register and share your experience - 
whether funny, sad or otherwise - for us all to share.<br>
<br>

Cheers and I look forward to hearing more of your adventures with the 
officious, the nosy and the downright rude - and of course the good news
 stories where you've been able to convert disbelievers!<br>
