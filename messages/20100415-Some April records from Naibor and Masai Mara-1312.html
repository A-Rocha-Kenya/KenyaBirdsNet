<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Dear All,</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Having just arrived in the Masai Mara, Vicki and I will be taking a few weeks leave (due to the rains) around Nairobi and beyond. So this month’s round-up is only for the first half of the month. Nevertheless, the first two weeks of April have provided me with some great birds including some smart “lifers”.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Top of this month’s pile has to be the small colony of Rufous-tailed Weaver found along the Mara river south of the confluence of the Talek river (see my previous posting). It was a most unexpected but very exciting find.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Several of my lifers were found in and around the small village of Talek, including several Usambiro Barbet and a smart Red-fronted Barbet today close to the Base Camp lodge there. Not far from Talek Gate, I located my first Athi Short-toed Lark today, including one pair collecting nest material. Also seen near the gate were several Purple Grenadier and Speckle-fronted Weaver while close to Fig Tree Camp a pair of Coqui Francolin could not be persuaded to leave the track and allowed the closest approach for photos. A couple of Eurasian Roller have been seen over the past few days and there have been many Lesser Grey Shrike around the reserve (up to 25 per day) for much of this week but only a few Red-backed Shrike and no Isabelline (Red-tailed) Shrike at all so far.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">On 11<sup>th</sup>, I made my first visit to the Musiara Swamp area which seemed pretty dried up in places (despite recent rains) although there were still some good birds to be had including 50+ Jackson’s Widowbird and plenty of Fan-tailed Widows too. Plenty of African Quailfinch were seen including my first “scoped” birds on the deck which made a change from flushing them along the tracks when driving. Eight Common Waxbill and several good sightings of Parasitic Weaver were also had in the area. An adult Night Heron was found roosting in a Village Weaver colony and we encountered a pair of Black Crake which showed very nicely. Nearby a pair of Long-toed Plover were the first that my drivers had seen in the reserve, as were a pair of Red-billed Teal seen in a dyke between the swamp and Rhino Ridge. All around the ridge, many White-tailed Lark proclaimed territories but most of the thousands of White Storks seen here in March had now departed. Along Paradise Plain I witnessed my first Jackson’s Widow lek – what a sight! Maybe eight males and plenty of females in attendance but just the one “jumper” which we thoroughly enjoyed. A Dark Chanting Goshawk was seen nearby and back towards camp a pair of African Hawk Eagle were displaying and have been seen in the same area since.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></font></font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A couple of Yellow Wagtail (race undetermined) fed busily just outside camp on 9<sup>th</sup> and 4-5 Red-throated Pipit were nearby. A drive to the Mara Sarova Hotel for a meeting produced a Cinnamon-breasted Rock Bunting and Banded Martin just outside their gates plus many Red-fronted Tinkerbird calling inside, plus Northern Black Flycatcher with two fledged young and several Yellow White-eye and Marico Sunbird here.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A probable Chiffchaff in camp on 6<sup>th</sup> was the one that got away for me as it disappeared before a full view was gained. A drive towards Entim Camp in the afternoon produced Eurasian Cuckoo and Lesser Grey Shrike plus my first Tabora Cisticola which sat in the same bush as a fine Golden-breasted Bunting with Flappet Lark displaying nearby. Near Irish Bridge, three Rufous-chested Swallow sat together in a bush before swooping down to the nest hole in the ground several times.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A Black-shouldered Kite flew over camp on 5<sup>th</sup> and was my first in the Mara. Around camp, the Red-chested Cuckoo fledgling was being fed by White-browed Robin Chats but no sign of the two immature Levaillant’s Cuckoo, just a single adult in early April.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">On 4<sup>th</sup>, I had a close encounter with a Little Sparrowhawk which landed just feet from my tent and allowed a very close approach with the camera. A stunning little raptor. In camp for much of the month has been a pair of Green-backed Woodpecker, plus single Nubian, Golden-tailed and Bearded Woodpecker giving support to the omnipresent Cardinals.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">As mentioned in March’s summary, a pair of Verreaux’s Eagle Owl graced our camp on 1<sup>st</sup> which thrilled staff and guests alike. I located the birds by their booming call and tracked them down to a fine tree above our spa. A Southern Ground Hornbill was looking bemused as it sat just feet above the owls and was clearly looking for one of its kind making the call – obviously mistaken. A pair of Chinspot Batis fed busily underneath the commotion.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Finally, the Paradise Flycatcher pair has successfully raised two young from the nest outside my office. </font></span></p>
