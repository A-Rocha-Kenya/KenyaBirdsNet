Dear All,
Whilst struggling to work out how to make the 500MB video file of
Erlanger's Boubou at Manda Island available for viewing, I have in the
meantime successfully posted a 50KB segment to the Nature Kenya
website  "naturekenya1000.ning.com" and it should be viewable there.
The segment contains two different calls but is only a fraction of the
original. (Under Videos). I have also posted images of the bird (Under
Photos) and the text as posted on the Net (Under Nature…. Although it
seems to be allocated to Sky and Insects!).
For regional birders, most will already be members but there is a
potential for this site to make other local birding interests more
accessible when it comes to images and videos… to compliment
"kenyabirdsnet." Those that aren't members of Nature Kenya probably
should be!
Best to all
Brian
