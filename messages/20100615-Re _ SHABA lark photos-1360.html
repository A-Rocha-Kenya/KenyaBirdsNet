<br>Thanks Brian
<br>for your ID which i would for sure and better trust than mine. I 
thought i was looking at a much heavier bill
<br>
<br>Just came from shaba and can't figure out if this would be the 
Singing or Friedmann's Bush Lark. The photographed individual never 
sang though other friedmann's were singing.
<br>
<br>many thanks

<br>Nice to ear from you. Hope you're fine.

<br>Brian also replied on my mail :

<br>Hi Patrick,
<br>It's a Red-capped Lark bleached by the soda in the soil, many almost
<br>lose all of their pattern,
<br>Best for now
<br>Brian
<br>Anyway thank you very much. Athi Short-toed Lark was also my though 
but for sure Brian knows much than me.
<br>
<br>Can you tell me were in Crater Lake did you spot the Grey-crested 
Helmetshrike? Near the lake?
<br>
<br>Thank you very much for the place you explained me last year for the 
William's Lark. I found it exactly at that place. In fact I was 
there one week after you.
<br>
<br>Hope we can go birding together.
<br>
<br>Best regards,
<br>
<br>Patrick
