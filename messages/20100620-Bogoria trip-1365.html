<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I decided to enjoy Bogoria this last week-end. I passed almost all the time outside the reserve looking after fresh water birds.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The first day, I finally got the Northern Red Bishop in picture. There&nbsp; were a few in the swamps displaying. Some Great Honeyguides were calling in the accacia trees. Today I decided to wake-up at 05,30 to explore a swamp a few kilometres far from the lodge. The swamp was full of water and also full of birds. I managed to see and pictured the Greater Painted-Snipe and the Dwarf Bittern. It was wonderful. I also spot the Little Bittern. But two birds were, I think, not common at this time in Bogoria. I saw a Ruff, the bird was healty and he was alone. The other one was really surprising me, a Barn Swallow, a beautiful male adult in flight. I wonder if some specimen are trying to stay over there and maybe also nesting there.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Any earlier report over those two species?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Many thanks,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Patrick</DIV></div><br>
