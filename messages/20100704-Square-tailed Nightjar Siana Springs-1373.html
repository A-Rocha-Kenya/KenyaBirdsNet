Whilst found virually throughout Tanzania, claims or<br>specimens have only occurred in this country along the border areas.<br>In the southern winter there is a withdrawal of southern breeding<br>birds, and it is at this time that the species does visit us, but<br>judging from records of road kills the species is certainly uncommon.<br>Each year at this period the bird does at least visit the Mara maybe<br>in greater numbers than we realise.<br>Last Tuesday 29th June, I was on a night game drive with a
 group, and<br>we found many nightjars on Siana Springs airstrip in the eastern Mara.<br>There were three species present, Dusky, Montane and Square-tailed. We<br>were able to pull up next to the birds and I took the advantage of<br>videoing a female Square-tailed, and have attached an image of the<br>bird to show that Square-tailed are indeed visiting us. There were a<br>number of the species present, in flight they appeared much smaller<br>than the other two species, and the short tail appeared<br>disproportionately so. With Slender-tailed occurring along our entire<br>border with Tanzania, it is possible that the species is overlooked<br>and could occur anywhere along this broad front.<br>Best for now<br>Brian</span><br><br></div><div style="position:fixed"></div>
