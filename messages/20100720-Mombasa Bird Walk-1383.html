<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dear Birders,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Our July walk (the first dry one for 3 months) was 
around the Huseini Dairy ponds in Nguu Tatu.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The small pond on the way up had a very active 
Little Grebe which we don't often see these days.&nbsp; Our first 2 Barn 
Swallows flew overhead. Flappet Lark&nbsp; also in the air.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Up at the car track Lilac Breasted Rollers were 
prevelant with one group of 3, 2 adults and a juvenile.&nbsp; Overhead was a 
beautiful Black Breasted Snake Eagle being mobbed and harassed by the 
Rollers.&nbsp; The path to the big pond were hard to find as everything is very 
overgrown after all the rain but we finally made it.&nbsp; Little Rush Warbler 
was calling but kept hidden. Other birds of note: Madagascar Squacco Heron 
flushed from a tree, a lone Common Sandpiper, several lovely African&nbsp;Black 
Crakes which apart from a couple of White Faced Whistling Ducks and a Black 
Headed Heron were the only water birds at the pond.&nbsp; Huge flocks of Red 
Billed Queleas coming in to roost as we left.&nbsp; Another 20 plus species seen 
and enjoyed.&nbsp; Good the bird walk was on Sat. as Sun&nbsp;had some of the 
heaviest rain we have seen.&nbsp; Enjoy you birding and feel welcome to join us 
if you are in Mombasa any 3rd Sat. in the month.&nbsp; (Marlene Reid - 
Mombasa)</FONT></DIV></BODY></HTML>
