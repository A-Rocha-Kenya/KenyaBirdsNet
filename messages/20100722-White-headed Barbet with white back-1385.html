Greetings birders

Paradise Lost in Kiambu near Nairobi is an excellent birding site. On July
21, Nature Kenya's Wednesday morning birdwalk had fabulous views of
White-backed Ducks and other wetland birds in the seasonal wetland on the
coffee estate.

Most exciting, however, were two White-headed Barbets on the eastern side of
the recreational site. One of the birds was white with black wings and a
black triangle on the back (white "back straps" between the triangle and the
wings). 

The other bird was entirely white except for the black wings and beak. It
was very beautiful.

White-headed Barbets are very variable, with a number of different
sub-species. However, I have never seen an all-white (except for the wings)
individual before.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
