A quick trip to Gatamaiyu forest on Saturday morning with the Plumbes turned up a couple of lovely bird parties although it was so cold that none of us wanted to hang around too long! Lots of signs of elephants...and very fresh.
Highlights were some lovely sightings of Black Fronted Bushshrike, African Hill Babblers, Narina Trogon, White-tailed Crested Flycatcher, Grey Cuckooshrikes and Emerald Cuckoo. Full list below.
