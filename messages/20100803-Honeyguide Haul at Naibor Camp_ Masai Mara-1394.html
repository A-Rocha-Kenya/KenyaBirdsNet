Dear All,

Around 6pm on 1st August, I heard a strange woodpecker-like call in
camp which I had never heard before and upon close inspection of the
tree from which it came, I located a Scaly-throated Honeyguide and, a
minutes later, a second close-by. Not only is this my first record at
Naibor but also a totally new bird for me, despite spending the past
two and a half years in East Africa. Sadly, it was a very overcast
evening and I was unable to get any decent images but it was a very
pleasant addition to my Mara list.

Then, yesterday morning (2nd August), my wife Vicki alerted me to a
honeyguide flying towards our dining mess so I went to check it out,
hoping it might be the Scaly-throated  back for a photo opportunity.
As I crept quietly up to the tree, I found a very small pale
Honeyguide sp., which I believe to be a Pallid Honeyguide (see
attached images 1,2,3), another species that I have not previously
seen, either at Naibor or anywhere else.

Image 1 – The bird as I first found it. Very pale grey underparts and
a pale grey head with no obvious malar stripe. At this angle the bill
appears small also. A pale loral spot can been seen.

Image 2 – A close-up crop of the bird in profile showing the very
small stubby bill and the lack of any malar stripe.

Image 3 – just before it took flight. A nice angle showing all of the
above features plus a short tail.

Seems a fairly straight-forward ID but maybe someone else has other
ideas (always welcome)?

Then, just after lunch, one of the Scaly-throated Honeyguides appeared
just outside the office and I was able to get a nice shot (Image 4).
This bird shows an odd pale collar around the neck which I cannot
explain or find reference to.

All in all, a great couple of days in a quiet period for birds – and
all happening within 50m of the office in camp!

Happy birding!

Adam
