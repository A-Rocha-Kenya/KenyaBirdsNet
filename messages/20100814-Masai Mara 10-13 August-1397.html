<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I had the pleasure to visit the Masai Mara game reserve with Johan and my children coming from Belgium these last days.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Birding was not the priority but we had the opportunity to spot some good birds. We spot a common Kestrel probably summering in our region. Also noticable a group of 9 Tabora Cisticola near Talek gate. We also spotted two groups of Magpie Shrike, the first group near Keekorok and the second on the way between Sekenani gate and ololeimutia gate.</DIV>
<DIV>We also met Adam Kennedy at his camp. A very beautiful place to stay and to go birding. For sure we will stay a few days in November. Many thanks to him for his hospitality.</DIV>
