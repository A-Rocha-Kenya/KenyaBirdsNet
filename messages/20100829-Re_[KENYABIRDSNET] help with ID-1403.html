Hi Dieter, Joseph et al.,

There are some interesting images here and I think that Joseph
certainly has some of the IDs correct. However, for my money, I'd
suggest the following;

1. Fan-tailed Widow rather than White-winged, based on the lack of any
white on the greater coverts. The bird on the far left looks
especially good for this species.
2. Parasitic Weaver (aka. Cuckoo Finch) - general jizz plus the head
shape and bill with flat-to-slightly concave culmen are indicative
3. Red-billed Quelea on the left but others are different, and
probably Parasitic Weaver
4.5. - Difficult to see but I'd put money on Parasitic Weaver and not
Holub's which is a brighter and often bulkier bird.
6. Again, looks like a worn Parasitic Weaver to me. Red-billed Quelea
would show a brighter red bill in most plumages, except immature when
it can be quite dull.
7.8. - Red-collared Widow - moulting male
9. I'm not convinced these are Village Weavers. The bird on the right
shows a pale eye and blue legs, suggesting female Lesser Masked
Weaver. I would expect bill and body to look more robust if they were
Village Weavers.
10. The same bird as the one on left in image 9 I guess? Dark eye
suggests an immature but this bird shows pinkish legs rather than
blue. The trickiest one for me!

I have attached two images of Parasitic Weaver taken in the Mara in
June for you to compare with the birds in images 2,4,5,6. I hope this
helps.

More feedback from the fundis required I think!

Cheers and best,

Subject: [KENYABIRDSNET] help with ID
















Hello all,

I'm Dieter Van den Heuvel from Belgium. I am a birdwatcher that visited
Kenya for 16 days last month. We visited Kenya with a group of 6 birders
that had absolutely no experience with the Kenian birdlife, so I guess you
can imagine it was very difficult for us to identify some of the birds that
were in winter plumage. We took pictures of most of the birds we saw, but
for some we don't succeed in pointing out the species. That's why we are
looking for some ID-help. I hope I'm not "abusing" this e-mail list and if
so please please let me know and ignore my e-mail. I was just hoping that
someone could help us with identifying the birds that are in the attached
images. All pictures were taken on July 21st in Nairobi NP.

thanks in advance
Dieter
