Hi Johan, Dieter et al.,

Glad to be of help.

As you say, the fourth bird on the right in Image 13 is a puzzling one
as it clearly shows warm rufous greater coverts, suggesting Fan-tailed
Widow (which is out of range, as Joseph pointed out) so, hopefully,
the fundis will be able to assist in the ID of this particular
individual.

Very best wishes,

Adam

Dear Joseph and Adam,

Thanks a lot for helping us out on the ID of these birds.

We saw them on our first day in Kenya (and my first day in Africa) so you
can imagine we had a hard time with these groups of birds in non-breeding
plumage. It's hard to find some good information or pictures of this
plumages, for some reason people like breeding males more :)

About the pictures:

4.5. I agree this is a male Parasitic Weaver. It's a crap picture indeed but
the short, stubby, black bill is just visible. Unfortunately we hadn't
noticed this male in the field (the picture is a large crop from a picture
of a group of birds), it would have made things easier!

3. Bird on the left is obviously a Red-billed Quelea, the bird on the right
seems to be a White-winged Widowbird and I can agree that the two birds in
the middle are female/imm. Parasitic Weaver, like the birds on picture 2 and
6.
Red-billed Quelea have longer bills, females have red bills and from many
pictures I found on the internet immatures seem to have an orange or pinkish
bill.
The only species that compare in size to Parasitic Weaver and also have such
a short, stubby bill are Red Bishops (but these species have an extremely
short primary projection, unlike the birds on my picture) and Cardinal
Quelea (which have the same size as Parasitic W).
However female type Quelea's don't show a pale crown stripe, while the bird
on the picture attached (picture 11) clearly has a pale crown stripe (the
right bird in this picture is the same bird as in picture 2). On the
internet I found a picture of female Parasitic Weavers (picture 12), they
clearly show a pale crown stripe.
I think the left bird in picture 11 is also Parasitic Weaver, it seems like
a worn adult female. The other Parasitics on the pictures could be
immatures.
There seems to be quite some variation in the coloration of this female-type
Parasitic Weavers?

7.8. I agree

9.10. These were small Weavers (of course you can't see that on the
pictures), so I knew it were Vitelline or Lesser Masked Weavers. Thanks Adam
for pointing out the difference in leg color between the two species, I
didn't know that. The bird on the right with grey legs and white eye should
indeed be a Lesser Masked. The bird on the left (indeed the same as in the
other picture) is probably an immature because of the dark eye, leg color
indicates Vitelline unless maybe imm Lesser Masked can also show pinkish
legs.

1. The Widowbirds. Luckily a friend of us has a picture of two birds from
this group flying off, clearly showing white patches in the wings. So there
must be White-winged Widowbirds in this group (we also saw some White-winged
Widowbirds flying around in the same area that day). Apparently the birds
(the males) on my pictures did a good job hiding the white primary coverts
and the white on the greater coverts. Picture 1 is a crop and is a part of a
larger group of birds.
I included another picture in higher resolution (picture 13) of the same
group, but with one bird that had newly arrived. It's the fourth bird from
the right, and it seems to show orange greater coverts. This is not right
for White-winged Widowbird, maybe this is a Fan-tailed Widowbird?
(the male Widowbird on the left in picture 1 shows brown-red lesser/median
coverts, and also another male on another picture does, I think that's OK
for White-winged)

We had a great time in this lovely country, and managed to safely identify
around 500 species in only 16 days.
There are a few other birds we couldn't identify safely, I hope you don't
mind us sending this pictures too.

Best regards and thanks again,
Johan

Dear Joseph,

You are quite right that White-winged Widow is far more likely a
candidate based on locality.

Where do you stand on the other identifications?

Hi Dieter, Joseph et al.,

There are some interesting images here and I think that Joseph
certainly has some of the IDs correct. However, for my money, I'd
suggest the following;

1. Fan-tailed Widow rather than White-winged, based on the lack of any
white on the greater coverts. The bird on the far left looks
especially good for this species.
2. Parasitic Weaver (aka. Cuckoo Finch) - general jizz plus the head
shape and bill with flat-to-slightly concave culmen are indicative
3. Red-billed Quelea on the left but others are different, and
probably Parasitic Weaver
4.5. - Difficult to see but I'd put money on Parasitic Weaver and not
Holub's which is a brighter and often bulkier bird.
6. Again, looks like a worn Parasitic Weaver to me. Red-billed Quelea
would show a brighter red bill in most plumages, except immature when
it can be quite dull.
7.8. - Red-collared Widow - moulting male
9. I'm not convinced these are Village Weavers. The bird on the right
shows a pale eye and blue legs, suggesting female Lesser Masked
Weaver. I would expect bill and body to look more robust if they were
Village Weavers.
10. The same bird as the one on left in image 9 I guess? Dark eye
suggests an immature but this bird shows pinkish legs rather than
blue. The trickiest one for me!

I have attached two images of Parasitic Weaver taken in the Mara in
June for you to compare with the birds in images 2,4,5,6. I hope this
helps.

More feedback from the fundis required I think!

Cheers and best,

Adam
