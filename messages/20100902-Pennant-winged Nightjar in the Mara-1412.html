Dear All,

Just to report a male Pennant-winged Nightjar close to Rekero Camp, as
seen by Disneynature camerawoman Sophie Darlington on the evening of
31st August. Despite working in the East African for over 20 years,
this was her first sighting of the species so she was over the moon
with her sighting.

I tried a local “twitch the following evening but it was too windy and
few nightjars were around. I had to “settle” for a lovely Serval
instead!

All the best,

Adam
Naibor Camp, Masai Mara
