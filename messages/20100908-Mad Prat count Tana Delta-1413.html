Phew,<br />totally cross-eyed (there must be software to do this automatically, e.g. from red cell or other blood counts or some such) but there are at least 3000 Madagascar Pratincole in the air in this combined picture and&nbsp;I am quite sure there were still quite a few on the ground (at least 10%). With a world population estimated estimated at between 5000 and 10000&nbsp;this means the Tana delta is likely to be a prime wintering site, if not the most important one (at least in favourable flood years like this one). Where do they go in dry years? Are&nbsp;the wintering grounds important in mortality or are the breeding grounds the critical life stage? Will they survive the planned further reduction in the Tana flows and flood peak magnitude?&nbsp;
