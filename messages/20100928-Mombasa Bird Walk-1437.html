<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dear Birders</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Sat Sept 17th took us to the South Quarry of Haller 
Park</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>This quarry is still being worked but the ponds in 
the part that is now obsolete are fast becoming established as good water bird 
areas.&nbsp; The many weavers nesting is truly a magnificent sight, Village, 
Golden Palm and Grosbeak with Zanzibar Red Bishops in among the Grosbeak weaver 
nests.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>We saw the largest number of Three Banded Plovers 
that I have ever seen.&nbsp; They&nbsp;love the large puddles&nbsp;and are 
easily seen scurrying around the edges.&nbsp; Migrant waders also seemed to 
favour these puddles probably because the large ponds are still very full and 
the wading space is rather waterlogged.&nbsp;&nbsp;A &nbsp;Curlew, a Wood. a 
Green&nbsp;and&nbsp;one or two Common&nbsp;sandpiper, Little Stint and a few 
Barn Swallows were the only migrants seen.&nbsp; Yellow Billed Stork, Cattle and 
&nbsp;Little&nbsp;Egrets. one Yellow Billed Egret,&nbsp;an unusually small 
number for this area.&nbsp; A few Green Backed Herons and one magnificent Purple 
Heron as the last bird of the afternoon.&nbsp; 29 species in all.&nbsp; If you 
are in Mombasa on the 3rd Sat in any month please feel welcome to join us.&nbsp;
