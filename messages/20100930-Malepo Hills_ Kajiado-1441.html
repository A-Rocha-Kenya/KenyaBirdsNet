Spent the weekend with the Succulenta Society on the Grant/Outram plot south of Kajiado on the Malepo Hills.It was very dry with long grass, hot in the day and cool in the evenings. There weren't many succulents ... so lots of time for Karen Plumbe, Heather Elkins and I to look for birds. Highlights were many small parties of Banded Parisoma. There were Tiny Cisticola, huge numbers of Emerald Spotted Wood dove (we had 13 in one tree beside a house with a water supply) many Red-fronted Barbets, a pair of Africa Hawk Eagles, a Pygmy Falcon, lots of swifts and martins, a Southern Grosbeak Canary and a Pink Breasted Lark.
