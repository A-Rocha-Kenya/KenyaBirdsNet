Hi Mark and Alison,
I was going to suggest you contact Adam as he has been seeing them
around Naibor since he has been there. Also they arrived at Klein's
Camp in northern Serengeti for the first time a couple of years ago,
so it seems the species is spreading out from the vicinity of Lake
Victoria.
Best for now
Brian

Hi Mark and Alison,

I hope you enjoyed your time at the Beaton's place; I've yet to visit but
hear it is stunning!

I'm based in the central Masai Mara Reserve and have also been hearing Swamp
Nightjar all season (mid-August onwards). I've also had brief flight views
at dusk but no decent images to speak of yet. As you say, it's off course
according to F&amp;S but it's certainly here.

Alastair Kilpin, who used to work in nearby Siana Springs area, also
reported this bird's presence to me a few months back when I first arrived
here.

I'd be very keen to see your list from your Mara visit if you get the time.

Warmest regards,

Adam Scott Kennedy
Naibor Camp, Masai Mara

I have just recently returned from a 3 week trip to Kenya. We finished off
by spending six nights at Topi cottage in the Olio Orok conservancy in the
Mara. On our first night there we heard what I was certain was a Swamp
Nightjar calling, this species is well known to us from bird monitoring
work
that we have carried out here in the Okavango Delta.

I was surprised to find on reading up the bird in Stevenson's reference
book that it has not been recorded from the Mara system. The next morning
I
checked with the guides who were with us and none of them were aware of
the
species.

Accordingly two nights later when the bird was again heard calling I
walked
out into the garden &amp; called the bird up using the tapes I allways travel
with. The bird responded immediately &amp; flew in over our heads on a full
moon
evening giving it's lovely fluting flight call &amp; then landed in the garden
and immediately started giving it's normal "Chuck, Chuck" ground call. We
heard this bird (there could easily have been more than one) calling on
five
of the six nights that we were staying at Topi cottage. I would like to
hear
back from the Kenya bird bofs what they think of this record.

Thanks - best regards - Mark Muller &amp; Alison Flatt.
