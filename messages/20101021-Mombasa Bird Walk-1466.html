<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>This large pond is really a delight but has to be 
approached very carefully as there is not much cover&nbsp;at &nbsp;the main 
access place where most of&nbsp;the water birds congregate.&nbsp; White Faced 
Whistling Ducks of which there are many&nbsp;are so sensitive that they take to 
the air before one gets anywhere near the edge of the water, alarming everything 
else.&nbsp; Once the birds have settled&nbsp;one can watch for ages it is such a 
captivating place.&nbsp; Special birds seen:&nbsp; Purple Swamphen, Common 
Moorhen with half grown young, African Darter, Common Squacco Heron, Long 
Crested Eagle flying overhead, Water Thick Knee, Little Egret, Great White 
Egret, Black Headed, Grey and Green Backed Herons.&nbsp; This is a major 
roosting place for Cattle Egret, large flocks flying in at dusk.&nbsp; Not many 
migrants yet, a flock of waders in a far off corner looked like Greenshank (this 
is a favourite place for them in large numbers).&nbsp;No Barn Swallows. 
&nbsp;Lots of nesting Village Weavers.&nbsp; We went to the football field at 
the end of the walk to look for Yellow Wagtails but not a one to be seen.&nbsp; 
They are usually around in large numbers by the end of Oct.&nbsp;&nbsp; (total 
26 species) Enjoy your birding. (Marlene Reid -
