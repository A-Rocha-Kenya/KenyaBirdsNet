Dear All,
Mike Davidson, Jeffery James, Fleur Ng'Weno, Karen Plumbe and myself, met at the Main Gate to Nairobi National Park on 5th November. There were four Willow Warblers feeding in the small bushes. It was a very gloomy and cold start to the day but brightened up late morning for a sunny remainder. We were through the gate at 6.30am and first visited the KWS Officers Mess garden. There were an unusual number of Olive Thrushes being attracted by small fruits, and amongst a variety of species this was also attracting a couple of Blackcap. There were three Tree Pipits on the lawn and a few Eurasian Bee-eaters in the trees. From here there was little at the Ivory Burning Site, a Nightingale was in the scrub but that was about it. It was quiet along the back to Hyena Dam, and just as sober here as well. 
On the Hyena Dam run off there were one each of Yellow-billed and Great Egrets, a handsome pair of Saddle-billed Storks, singles of Montagu's Harrier, Common Buzzard, Eurasian Hobby, Common Snipe, several Green and Wood Sandpipers, Yellow Wagtail and House Martin, but pride of place went to an out-of plumage Black Coucal which posed on a low bush for ten minutes. Whether this is the bird seen a few years ago over an eight month period, along the adjacent Mokoyiet River, or one last year in Athi Basin is not known, as they were all in breeding plumage and this individual could even be an immature.  Additionally the first of eight Northern Wheatears were seen.
