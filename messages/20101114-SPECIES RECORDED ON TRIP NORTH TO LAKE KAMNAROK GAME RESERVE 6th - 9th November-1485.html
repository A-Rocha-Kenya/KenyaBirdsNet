Nigel Hunter and myself went on a four day (three night) excursion to examine a few wetlands in the Great Rift Valley north of Nairobi. The most distant of these was to be Lake Kamnarok National Reserve in the Kerio Valley. This was to try and find the Abyssinian Ground Hornbills that Ben Mugambi has seen on a number of occasions.
We were not successful in this aim, but the locals of the area know the bird well, and say that it is a wet season visitor to the area. 
The other major centres that we were visiting were Hippo Camp on Lake Naivasha, the northern end of Lake Nakuru and Olbainita Swamp near Kampi ya Moto on the Baringo Road. We stopped a few times to and from these main objectives, and were amazed on writing up our list of species recorded to find that we had exceeded 320 species Nairobi and back to Nairobi.
We left Nairobi at 8.30am on the 6th Nov and drove directly to KWS Hippo Camp, then after a couple of hours departed for Lake Nakuru NP arriving through the Lanet Gate and departing at 5.30pm out of the Main Gate. Our overnight was in the Kunste Hotel, where we had a twin suite for Ksh3000 which was very comfortable. We left at 6.00am on the 7th Nov, and were at Olbainita and hour later, all of our birding on the swamp was from the raised bank just past the old pump house. We departed here at 11.30am for Kabarnet, checked into the Kabarnet Hotel for a two-night stay. We had Room 210; it was comfortable, well furnished and clean. At the princely sum of Ksh1800 per night (that was Ksh900 each) that included cooked Breakfast, it has to be amongst the best value in the country. The menu was either Chicken or Goat with a choice of Ugali, Chips or Rice. We had the Chicken and Chips both nights, and the chicken was very well prepared and very tasty and tender, whilst the chips were excellent. Soup, Main Course, a huge bowl of Fruit Salad and Tea or Coffee was a total of 500Ksh each, and this too is very good value. The staff was excellent and had our breakfast on the table when we had asked for it at the unreasonable time of 6.00am!
After a short rest we had a brief excursion along the Tot Road for some 12kms before turning back, and on the 8th Nov, we drove 20km to the junction for the 5km entrance to Lake Kamnarok, a total of 25km from the Kabarnet-Kerio River road, whilst the sign at the junction tells you that it is 38km to Lake Kamnarok which is a load of rubbish. KWS must have selected a figure at random that has no relationship with reality! For residents the entrance is Ksh100 per person and Ksh 100 for the vehicle. Alfred is in charge and very pleasant, we had two guides William and Simpson who were both keen. Although only a couple of hours at the Lake, we spent the entire day in the Kerio looking at the riverine forest near the bridge over the gorge in the late afternoon. On the 9th Nov, we left the Kabarnet Hotel at 7.00am and stopping a couple of times on the decent road to Marigat, the pull-off look-out over Lake Baringo, and the last luggar some two kilometres before the junction. Leaving at 11.30am we departed straight for Nairobi getting back in just under four hours.

Throughout the region we visited, the landscape was green and attractive, there had been recent rain and many trees showed new foliage. Hippo Camp was incredible, the water now comes right to the base of the causeway, and you can use the vehicle as a hide and watch birds five metres away. The water is the highest for many many years, and presumably with the apparently wet period we are experiencing will climb even further.
We drove past the log that still blocks the road down towards Hippo Point, the road is fine. The water has come up, and the only indication of the creek is a line of grass protruding above the water where the banks are submerged. The Acacias are underwater.
On the northern shore, the water has flooded the flats and formed numerous sedge-fringed lagoons that are well worth investigation. The lake edge has many bays where fresher water soaks are an attraction, and large concentrations occur. Olbainita looks a little more full than it did two months ago. It is still the most important wetland that we have for breeding waterbirds, and was magnificent. Finally Lake Kamnarok was a large pan with white Nympha caerulea water-lilies, entirely encircled by oozy mud, and has an extraordinary concentration of crocodiles.  To walk all the way around would take the better part of a day, and we were only able to walk a kilometre in a clockwise direction until blocked by the delta of its feed river, which was flowing into the lake. By taking an anti-clockwise approach it would have been possible to cover most of the lake. From a raised point under a stand of acacias it is possible to scope the entire lagoon, but smaller shorebirds cannot be identified, as the distance is too great. Lake Kamnarok is a must to visit at present and is attracting impressive numbers of waterbirds.
So all of the four water-bodies that we visited were avian paradises, areas so vast and with so much cover that in spite of the numerous exciting finds we knew that we were only scratching the surface.
The details are broken into firstly the Palearctic presence, then interesting records relating to Afrotropicals, as Lake Kamnarok has not received much attention, a complete list of the species we recorded there, followed by a complete list of species recorded.

DIDRIC CUCKOO
