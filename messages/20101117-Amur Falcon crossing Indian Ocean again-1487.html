<BR>
The first of the satellite-tracked Amur Falcons has now crossed the Indian Ocean again on its autumn migration. It was the same bird of a group of several adults which had been tracked in spring from South Africa to NE-China which had crossed the Ocean as the first of them from Somalia to India.<BR>
<BR>
This time the bird flew via Nagpur and Bombay to reach the Horn of Africa on an almost streight line some 350 kms south of the track in spring. The ocean passage had a distance of over 2500 kms which were covered in two days non-stop flight. The bird has immediately continued its migration parallel to the coast and has reached almost the boarder of Kenya and Tanzania by now. <BR>
<BR>
One more bird has today left the stop over area in NE-India and we expect it to&nbsp; arrive near Bombay very soon.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Best wishes,<BR>
