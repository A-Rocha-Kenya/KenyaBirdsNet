Hi all i will like to verify if this has spotted before at the forest.
Today at Arabuko Swamp after along day walk with a photographer we turned our tour at Arabuko Swamp going back to visitor centre which is six kilometre. A flock of Wool neck stork numbering 14 of them and in between was a stranger that i have not seen here at the forest what? Stork, Which one? Marabou stork? where? at the Arabuko Swamp doing what? foraging with the stork and Africa Fish ealgle landing on the ground attracted the photographer who is not a birder.
The Question is? Is this  First sighting or any body had seen it Here?.
Make my dreams if i will be the first to see it here!!!!!!!!!.
Thank all please Respond to it.
regards
Jonathan
