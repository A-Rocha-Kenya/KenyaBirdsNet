Dear All,
Very briefly as I am having a couple of days between tours. Be very
very wary of Tsavo Red-faced as they are much much paler than normal
birds and a trap for the unwary. I would imagine that this very pallid
form extends into Mkomazi and further south. These birds are pale
buffy grey lacking the reddish tones throughout (including any trace
on the face). I don't think that SLBC has shown any southwards
tendency. The bill is so long that it looks like an Anthreptes
sunbird. I will send some images over when I return,
Best for now
Brian

Hi all

is there any evidence to suggest a southwards expansion of range of this
bird in
recent years ? our first record for Tanzania was in Mkomazi GR in Nov 94.
Since
then there have been at least 4 obs from this, now NP, and more recently a
record near Same in August this year and then another from the Kitwei Plain
last
week. This latter site is 150km from the Kenya border in a straight line
through
the Mkomazi gap between the West Usambara and South Pare mts.

whist observer effort (esp the lack of it) will play some part in the
paucity of
records there is a suggestion here of an expansion of range.

any comments most welcome.
