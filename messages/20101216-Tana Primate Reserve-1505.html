Hi all it is good to share this about a trip to Tana Primate. i went there for four days doing research assistance the lesser galagol with student from USA doing his masters. The place is fantastic as it has its uniqueness forest that falls along the riverline of the great Tana River.
The number of things found here are amazing as i comper it to the arabuko Forest. Birds are more some species found at Arabuko though the habitat of this forest has high canopy cover and not dense at the under growth.
Birds captured are 79 species whic include the Shrub bush and the River line forest. i had not done alot on birding as the environment high humidity. i we use to work at Night for the Galagols.
This trip was on 8th to 12th december 2010.
What i observed during my birding is The red capped robin chat which is still here and while it should have left to Souther Africa.
on 14th Dec 2010 i guided birding guest at Arabuko and i was keen on red capped Robin Chat, where i didnt hear it or see, as i wanted to know their Movement
The question, what could be the difference between the two Forest for this afro migrant bird in king of time of departure to their breeding groung?.
