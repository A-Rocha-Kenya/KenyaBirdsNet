Dear Kenyan birders,<br>


<br>


Just a quick note to encourage you to have a look at our ethnoornithological colleague Mark Cocker's <i><b>Birds and People</b></i> book project which is, after more than five years of hard work, within sight of completion.<br>


<br>


For those not familiar with Mark's work - particular his work on 
ethnoornithology - I would recommend that you have a look at his regular
 contributions to the <i><b><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/series/country-diary+profile/mark%5C%20cocker">Country Diary</a> </b></i>at <i><b>The Guardian</b></i> and also his previous books, including his<br>


wonderful look at the ethnoornithology of the United Kingdom in his magisterial book <i><b><a href="http://www.rbooks.co.uk/product.aspx?id=0701180072">Birds Britannica</a></b></i>, which has been described as:<br>


<br>


"...one of the most important bird books of the last decade. It covers 
cultural links; social history; birds as food; ecology; the lore and 
language of birds; myths, art, literature and music; anecdotes, birdsong
 and rare facts; modern developments; migration, the seasons and our 
sense of place. An attempt to describe the interaction of birds and 
humans, it captures the essence of why birds matter."<br>


<br>


Birds and People is a collaborative effort and after five years work Mark notes that:<br>


<br>


"Birds and People is a book closing in on completion. It has been an 
enormously challenging project but we have had a fabulous response from 
people all over the world. To date 380 individuals of 60 nationalities<br>


have submitted many thousands of contributions on the full spectrum of 
ways that birds and people interact. These participants include a huge 
cross section of humanity, from life-serving prisoners to<br>


internationally acclaimed, award-winning poets and novelists, from 
Mongolian eagle-hunters to Iranian schoolteachers, and from Maya to 
Maoris and Masai."<br>


<br>


You can read more about this ground-breaking work at the <i><b><a href="http://www.birdsandpeople.org/">Birds and People website</a>&nbsp;</b></i> here.<br>


<br>


And if you are interested in learning more about - and contributing to -
 the fascinating world of ethnoornithology and ethnobiology I would recommend a visit to 
the website of the <i><b><a href="http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/group/Ethnoornithology/">Ethnoornithology Research &amp; Study Group</a></b></i>.<br>


<br>


Best of the season to you all,<br>
