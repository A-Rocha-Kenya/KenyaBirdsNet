Dear Kenyan Birders,<br><br>At three of the last five <a href="http://ethnobiology.org/" target="_blank"><i><b>Society of Ethnobiology</b></i></a> conferences we have held a session dedicated to ethnoornithology. <br><br>Anumber
 of similar sessions have been conducted at various 
ethnobiology,anthropological and ornithological conferences across the 
globe in recent years.<br><br>In this spirit I am seeking expressions of interest for participation in a dedicated ethnoornithology session at the <a href="http://ethnobiology.org/conference/upcoming" target="_blank"><b>2011 Society of Ethnobiology meeting at Columbus, Ohio</b></a> from 4 to 7 May 2011.<br><br>At this stage i do not have a draft theme for the proposed session. I note that the conference theme for 2011 is "<i><b>Historical and Archaeological Perspectives in Ethnobiology</b></i>".<br><br>The conference convenors note that:<br><br>"We
 welcome all papers that touch on relationships between humans and other
 organisms, both past and present.&nbsp;In keeping with the conference theme,
 we are particularly interested in soliciting presentations that address
 the following topics and approaches:<ul><li>History and evolutionary 
significance of important ethnobiological patterns, such as plant and 
animal domestication, food processing, hunting, environmental 
management, and the use of animals and plants in ceremony, crafts, and 
traditional medicine</li><li>Application and integration of multiple lines of archaeological and paleoenvironmental evidence</li><li>Incorporation
 of ethnographic and documentary information into studies of past 
relationships between humans and culturally important animals and plants</li><li>Human paleoecology, including human impact on past environments"</li></ul>I
 have a paper that I am working on that will fit into this theme and 
would encourage any of you that have work that touches on the conference
 theme - and/or that relates to the relationships between birds and 
human cultures to take part in the proposed session.<br><br>I note that <u><b>the deadline for abstract submission is 15 February 2011</b></u>.<br><br>Please drop me a line by return email to discuss your proposed paper and how we might progress form here.<br><br>Please feel free to pass this proposal on to anyone you think may be interested.<br>
<br>
