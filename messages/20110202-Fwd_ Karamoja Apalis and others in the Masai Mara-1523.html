<div class="gmail_quote">Hi All,<br>
<div class="gmail_quote"><br>After a failed attempt to locate Karamoja Apalis in the Mara with Simon Ball last year, I&#39;ve been itching to get back out to the Whistling Thorn thickets to the east of the reserve and try my luck again. <br>
<br>On 29th January, Vicki and I took a long day drive to see the old Naibor site at Ol Kinyei via the new 50,000 acre conservancy Naboisho. We headed due east out of Talek Gate and after around 30 minutes, while taking a five-minute bird stop among some extensive Whistling Thorn, I heard a call I was unfamiliar with which, sure enough, turned out to be three Karamoja Apalis! No sooner had I found them, they shot off through the thorn scrub and I took off on foot to try and obtain some images. It was after a minute that I re-found them and I realised that it was a pair feeding a juvenile (the bottom bird in IMG_1288), who made begging calls for attention. Is this the first &quot;confirmed&quot; breeding record in Kenya, I wonder?<br>
<br>No sooner had I grabbed this shot, they took off again. This time I located what I presumed was the male who had his tailed cocked and called incessantly (IMG_1313) then the young bird returned and I obtained some mildly better shots where you can just about make out the gape flange (IMG_ 1319 &amp; IMG_1330). Once I was around 400m from our vehicle I decided to let the quarry go and avoid a chance encounter with a Lion but I was now one happy birder!<br>
<br>The day continued with some great birds including a pair of Pangani Longclaw at the old Naibor site, a few Taita Fiscals and three Two-banded Courser next to the main road from Narok to Sekanani Gate. There were plenty of Steppe Eagle in the air throughout the day and a small flock of European Bee-eater and a fine Cinnamon-breasted Rock Bunting near the Sekanani Gate.<br>
<br>All in all, a great day out!<br><br>Warmest regards,<br><br>Adam<br>Naibor Camp, Masai Mara<br><a href="http://www.naibor.com/" target="_blank">www.naibor.com</a><br>
