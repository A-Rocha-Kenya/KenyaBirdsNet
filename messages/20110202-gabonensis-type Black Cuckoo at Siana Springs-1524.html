<div>Hi All,<br><br>Vicki and I were due some leave so decided to stay local for a few days and explore the southern sectors of the Mara.<br><br>It started well on 28th January when we saw 3 Oribi, close to Salas Camp (close to TZ border) where we had lunch. The following day (29th), we headed to Keekorok for the night. On the way, we found an immature Black Stork circling close to that lodge and followed it as it went down to preen on a wet marsh nearby. At Keekorok, a few Angola Swallow were buzzing around the Hippo Pool in the afternoon but nothing else too unusual. We headed on a game drive past the airstrip in the late afternoon where the highlights were a Spotted Thick-knee a fine male Pallid Harrier, and we enjoyed sundowners on the strip with an approachable male Montagu&#39;s Harrier. We enjoyed several nightjars at the Hippo Pools that evening and although none were calling I managed to ID silhouetted Slender-tailed easily enough but not so sure about several others. Next morning (30th), the Hippo Pool area was fairly quiet although a Black Crake was nice to see up close and there were plenty of Blackcap and a few White-headed Barbet around. We drove deep into the valley south of Keekorok where we found a Cheetah with two six-month old cubs on a fresh kill and a single White-headed Vulture nearby, plus a pair of Crowned Crane with a single egg in a nest.<br>
<br>We then headed to Siana Springs where we stayed for 2 nights - what a place! On arrival we were greeted with good views of a pair of Klaas&#39;s Cuckoo and calling Sulphur-breasted Bushshrike. A small drive along the airstrip in the late afternoon produced two Magpie Shrike and a bright Icterine Warbler but there was only one nightjar present on the strip after sundown, which remained unidentified but was probably the same bird as the following evening.<br>
<br>Next morning (31st), I walked around the camp with the best bird being a Buff-bellied Penduline Tit calling - not seen sadly - and a juvenile Red-chested Cuckoo being fed by the local Robin Chats. I then took a drive around the airstrip which was great. Almost the first bird I found was a Black Cuckoo (my first in the Mara) which, on closer inspection, was clearly one of the western races. Zimmerman et al mentions a west Kenyan  &#39;<em>jacksoni</em>&#39; (an intergrade between <em>clamosus</em> and <em>gabonensis</em>?) which I&#39;m not sure has been qualified as a proper race but this bird showed all the attributes of a full-blown &#39;<em>gabonensis</em>&#39; - see images attached. If I remember correctly, Niall Anderson photographed a similar bird at Kichwa Tembo a few years ago but I am not sure what the eventual conclusion was? Any feedback on this would be appreciated.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>Within minutes of this encounter, I had also recorded Diederick, African and Jacobin Cuckoo so there must surely have been plenty of caterpillars around. In the mixed bird flocks, there were Olivaceous Warbler, Little and Vitelline Weavers, Grey Woodpecker (the African Grey-headed race), Green-winged Pytilia and plenty of other commoner species. Two more Spotted Thick-knee were welcomed and nearby, I saw my first Fawn-coloured Larks in the Mara and three Grey-headed Silverbill before heading back to camp for a break. In the afternoon, a resident group of Black-and-white Colubus Monkeys (9) visited the Sausage Tree in front of the restaurant and we thoroughly enjoyed watching them up close. Who&#39;d have thought they would be in the Mara?</div>

<div> </div>
<div>As the sun went down I clocked a large raptor land in some trees and as I went to investigate I soon found a huge Crowned Eagle scanning for prey just 50m away! Again, something I would not have expected on this side of the Mara.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>After dinner, we searched the airstrip for nightjars but could only find the one, and at exactly the same spot as the previous night&#39;s bird. This time, it sat still on the strip and I was able to get some close-up images showing a narrow white bar across the lesser wing coverts which I hope show that it is Square-tailed (see IMG_0489)! I think I&#39;m right in saying that Brian Finch recorded this species back in June (or thereabouts) so I wonder if this species is resident here, rather than just a migrant?</div>

<div> </div>
<div>The following morning (1st February), we set off early in search of Yellow-necked Spurfowl but failed to find any but a lone <em>phoenicuroides</em> Isabelline Shrike (my first in the Mara) more than made up for it.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>We&#39;re now looking forward to a break up north, exploring Meru NP, Mt Kenya, Solio and the Aberdares NP so if anyone has some handy tips on some great birds up that way, I&#39;d be glad to receive them.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>All the best,</div>
