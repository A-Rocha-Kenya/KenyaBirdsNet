If there is anyone out there who is very competent in birds and has some time to spare to help with the Kenyabirdfinder database, can you please let me know? I am looking for people who know a location such as Naivasha or Masai Mara very well, or a group of birds such as raptors very well, or both, to help monitor the records in the database. You would need an internet connection. We would log you on as an administrator and then you could look through records from home in your own time and validate, reject or put aside for further consideration. Easy! Validated records can then be put towards forming an updated Kenya Bird Atlas. Please contact me at <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:darfreid@hotmail.com">darfreid@hotmail.com</a> to volunteer or for further information. Thanks. Fiona Reid
