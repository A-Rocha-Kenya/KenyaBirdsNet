<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Dear All,</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Having spent several days exploring the
Mara, Vicki and I decided to spend the rest of our leave up country to see some
different countryside, mammals and birds.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">We accepted an invitation to explore the
pretty Ngobit River Lodge, a little way north of Nyeri, and were pleased to
record over 50 species from the grounds in the space of the last two hours of
light upon our arrival on 6<sup>th</sup> February, and another two hours the
following morning. Best of all were a pair of African Wood Owl that were
roosting on the lodge grounds and shown to us by the manager Mr Karanja. They
were easily spooked, however, and as they flew a short distance to cover an
African Goshawk was immediately onto the smaller of the birds and chased it
around for several minutes before it lost interest. All three birds were seen
at the same location the following morning.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">I am very poor at naming
tree and shrub species in East Africa, so cannot provide any further
information on the fabulous tree that was flowering in the lodge garden that
was FULL of busily feeding sunbirds including Eastern Double-collared, Bronze,
Amethyst, Variable and a smart male Green-headed Sunbird. Do drop me a line if
you are interested in staying at this very affordable lodge and I will gladly
provide you with the relevant phone numbers.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">After breakfast on the morning of 7<sup>th</sup>,
we took a slow drive to Solio Game Reserve (seeing several Mottled Swift along
the way) where we spent a luxurious 4 nights at Solio Lodge – probably the only
place in Kenya where we’ve enjoyed “camp envy” it is so stunning! The game
reserve is equally impressive for numbers of Black and White Rhino, Beisa Oryx
and others, and the birdlife was plentiful. Although I only claimed the one
“lifer” (Wing-snapping Cisticola), many good birds were seen here, especially
raptors. Nigel Archer told me this was a MUST-VISIT place for anyone
interested in birds of prey and it didn’t disappoint. Oddly enough, what was
probably the best raptor on site, a pair of Crowned Eagle, eluded us but we
enjoyed looking through the images taken by William Carr-Hartley on the day of
our arrival of the pair dismantling a Vervet Monkey at close range. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Probably the best record of our visit relates
to a Pied Wheatear of the form (race?) vittata, which initially set the heart
pumping as it looked very good for Black-eared Wheatear to start with! See
images attached of this bird. It is described as “uncommon” in Fanshawe and
Stevenson, but does anyone have an idea how many records turn up each year of
this form?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Other good sightings included;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Purple Swamphen (a pair with two well-grown
young), Caspian Plover (a single that was very tame), Verreaux’ Eagle Owl
(a pair), more Mottled Swift over, Blue-cheeked Bee-eater (8+), Eurasian Bee-eater (2
groups of 5/6 each), both African and Eurasian Hoopoe, a couple of Tree Pipit,
maybe 8 or 9 Eurasian Rock Thrush, a Common Nightingale feeding in our
headlights one evening, several Little Rush Warbler, a group of Black-lored
Babbler (7 of the race vepres), many Isabelline Shrike, a small group of White-crested
Helmet Shrike and a stunning Long-tailed Widowbird displaying in full breeding
plumage to a couple of females.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">All in all, a great few days that were
complemented with sightings of Steinbuck (new for us), a Lioness with three
cubs, two male Cheetah and a pair of charging White Rhino that we narrowly
avoided!!!</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Best wishes,</span></p>
