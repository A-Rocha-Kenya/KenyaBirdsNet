<div>Thanks to all who emailed about the Chestnut Weaver - which the general concensus supports.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This morning I had two of them (both in similar plumage) at the office along with 40+ Village Weaver.</div>

<div>A very pleasing local patch tick!</div>

<div>See attached an image of a female Chestnut Weaver taken in Namibia (borrowed from the PHOWN website - a great resource on Weavers that I recommend everyone takes a look at and contribute where possible), which shows the extent of yellow tone on the face and neck that I was originally concerned about. I find the images in both Zimmerman and F&amp;S just a little misleading in that they do not show any hint of yellow tone in them, and these guides do not allude to this feature in the text either.</div>

<div>All the best </div>
