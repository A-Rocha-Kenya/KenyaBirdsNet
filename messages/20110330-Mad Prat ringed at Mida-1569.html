    We've just had a couple of nights ringing waders on Mida with a
    total of just short of 200 birds caught. Good numbers of Lesser and
    Greater Sand Plovers, the latter about the leave, the former still
    fattening and with very few in breeding plumage. But the highlight
    of the two nights was the almighty suprise of taking a long-winged,
    dark bird with a white rump out of the net... some sort of <i>petrel</i>???!!

    but no, with the short curved bill and longer strong legs, it turned
    out to be nothing less than an immature Madagascar Pratincole!! This
    is one of the few records of the species at Mida anyway and is also
    quite an early date - certainly my first I've heard of this year.
    This must be one of the only ones ringed in Kenya - must find out
    from the Ringing Coordinator.<br>
    <br>
    Also ringed were 1 Saunder's Tern, 1 White-winged Black Tern and 1
    Common Tern. 12 Crab-plovers (10 in the same round...!), 16 Grey
    Plovers, Greenshank and plenty of Little Stint and Curlew Sandpipers
    coming into their beautiful brick red breeding plumage.<br>
    <br>
    Some old retrap birds in amongst the new ones including a Curlew
    Sandpiper from 1999 and Grey Plover from 2005.<br>
    <br>
    Other records from around include the first Yellowbill calling at
    Mwamba, the A Rocha Centre yesterday (29th), plenty of Eurasian
    Golden Orioles around (1 ringed last Friday - check the A Rocha
    Kenya facebook page for a picture), Carmine Bee-eaters still very
    much in evidence with many in moult and therefore with short tails
    etc, my first Long-crested Eagle right on the beach, at least 3
    Common Terns found very weak and later died or already dead on the
    beach last week - must have been a storm or something out at sea
    though here it has been hot and dry so far. 7 what could only have
    been Sooty Terns high overhead the beach on Saturday evening at dusk
    - though quite what they were doing up there I have no idea.
    Eurasian Bee-eaters going through, plenty of Barn Swallows and we're
    planning on putting nets up in our nature trail to see what warblers
    &amp; Rufous Bush Chats may be moving through too...<br>
    <br>
    We've had a <i>Grewia plagiophylla</i> tree in full blossom in the
    compound that had at least 20 Purple-banded Sunbirds in it all day
    that was an amazing sight to see. Looked hard for Violet-breasted
    but all were P-banded; we tried to catch some, got one... and the
    oriole. <br>
