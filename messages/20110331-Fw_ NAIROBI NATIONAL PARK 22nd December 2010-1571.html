At least he is benefiting from his marooning here.<br>We arrived at Main Gate at 6.30am, and made our first call at the<br>Ivory Burning Site. There was a female Pied Wheatear (first of eight),<br>one of only two Spotted Flycatchers, the first of only eight Willow<br>Warblers, and a few Nightingales grumbled from the bushes. There were<br>some noisy Shelley’s Francolins calling persistently as was a Zanzibar<br>Sombre Greenbul somewhere behind Nagalomon Dam, but other than that<br>there was nothing else to report from here.&nbsp;
 Because of the pipeline<br>closing off the road to the back of Hyena Dam entirely, we went past<br>Nagalomon Dam, where there was a smart male Darter, and two Common<br>Snipe. Then following the eastern roads through the forest along the<br>Mokoyiet River we had a stunning pair of very tame adult Black Storks,<br>the Bateleur was at its nest site, there were a couple of Common<br>Buzzards, and drinking by the river several Yellow-bellied Waxbills<br>and a single Black-and-White Mannikin. A party of scrub and forest<br>species contained a Brown-backed Woodpecker. Not a lot was happening<br>at the “drinking pond” but there were a couple of Blackcaps, and a<br>Booted Eagle flew over. The nearby dam had the only Little Grebe of<br>the day and a pair of Yellow-billed Duck. We skirted past the road to<br>the Langata Entrance and worked the edge of the forest to find<br>Hartlaub’s Turacos, which appeared only after a good search. There was<br>a Nairobi
 Pipit on a cairn, but little else as we passed through the<br>forest. On the way to Kingfisher we had a very obliging African Water<br>Rail. The grasslands held many Red-collared Widowbirds, males with<br>long tails but rather patchy plumage. There was a single male<br>Jackson’s singing at the swamp that was in full breeding plumage.<br>Kingfisher Picnic Site was quiet were it not for Striped Kingfishers<br>feeding noisy young in the nest, and mating White Rhinos. The only<br>migrant was the only Olivaceous Warbler for the day. The rough ground<br>along the road towards the Kisembe Bridge had the first of fifteen<br>Northern and first of twenty-five Isabelline Wheatears, there was also<br>a male Red-backed Shrike and the first of five Red-tailed Shrike, with<br>all being isabellinus, contrary to phoenicuroides being by far the<br>most abundant at Ngulia. There was little of interest all the way to<br>Olmanyi Dam and on to the Mokoyiet River. Here we
 had the first of<br>seven Whinchats for the day.&nbsp; On passing Nagalomon Dam again, there<br>was a most attractive Swamphen feeding in the shallows. Hyena Dam was<br>not productive apart from six Crowned Cranes, and it was also very<br>quiet on the run-off where there was a Saddle-billed Stork, and a<br>single Yellow-billed Egret. On the internal road to Karen Primary<br>School Dam there was a solitary Athi Short-toed Lark, and four<br>White-tailed Larks. Taking the “Beacon” road to Empakasi Dam we found<br>two Common Snipe, a Little Stint and a single Namaqua Dove (and<br>another in Athi Basin) but there were over fifty Quail-Finch drinking.<br>On the way to Athi Basin there was a Steppe Eagle and the only<br>Rosy-breasted Longclaw of the day. Athi Dam was most impressive though<br>bizarrely lacking in Palearctic waders. Amongst the five hundred or so<br>Marabou, were fifty Abdim’s, three White and a single Yellow-billed<br>Stork, our sixth
 species of stork for the day. Amongst the several<br>hundred Sacred was a single Glossy Ibis and three African Spoonbills.<br>Ducks were poor with fifteen White-faced and three Red-billed Teal<br>apart from Egyptian Geese with two fresh broods.&nbsp; Afrotropical waders<br>included two Spur-winged Plover, only two Kittlitz’s Plovers, and two<br>Black-winged Stilt, migrants were limited to twelve Little Stint, a<br>Ruff, three Greenshank, and a couple each of Wood and Common<br>Sandpipers. Other birds were a single Speckled Pigeon, and an equally<br>solitary Red-throated Pipit. Not far from the corner of the Causeway<br>was a Temminck’s Courser. At Cheetah Gate there was an African Hoopoe,<br>one d’Arnaud’s Barbet, the only Eurasian Rock-Thrush of the day, a few<br>Lesser Masked Weavers and a Crimson-rumped Waxbills.<br>A walk at Hippo Pools was quiet with one Eurasian Reed Warbler and two<br>Wattled Starlings. Heading back via Leopard Cliffs we
 found a Common<br>Kestrel, the only falcon all day, a Black-shouldered Kite, a House<br>Martin and one Eurasian Roller.<br>We were through Langata Gate shortly after 6.30pm.<br>It seemed a fairly quiet day, very disappointing for palearctics,<br>nevertheless we recorded over two-hundred species. Green Sandpipers<br>were on most of the larger and some very small bodies of water, Barn<br>Swallows were not very numerous and there was no indication of<br>passage. The absence of all three migrant Harriers was a shock, but<br>perhaps the most alarming is the lack of migrant falcons, where on<br>earth are the Lesser Kestrels?<br>Mammals were in very impressive numbers in Athi Basin, but a good<br>scattering elsewhere. We saw six White Rhinoceros together at<br>Kingfisher Picnic Site, and three separate Suni sightings in the<br>forest.<br>The day started off dry and continued in the same vain all day, the<br>afternoon around Hippo Pools was warm.<br>It was a
 very nice day, and whilst long stretches of grassland seem<br>birdless, the other habitats are full of niceties.<br><br>Best for now<br>Brian<br></div></div><div style="position:fixed"></div>
