Dear all,

Two adult female Amur Falcons have now been tracked for the second time 
crossing the Indian Ocean during spring migration. These two birds have been 
fitted with 5 g PTTs in January 2010. They left Africa again from Somalia and 
bypassed Socotra island. Both falcons took almost the same route over the 
ocean. Before arriving in India they were located both at almost the same 
place some 325 km west of the coast on 29 April at 0.59 hrs (UTC) and 3 May 
21.14 hrs.  Both  birds continued migrating over land without stopping and 
quickly arrived  in Birma. Now we hope to track them again back to their breeding 
sites in NE China.

Kind regards,

Bernd Meyburg
