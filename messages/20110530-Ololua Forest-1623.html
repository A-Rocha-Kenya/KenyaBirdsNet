Karen Plumbe and I had a lovely walk in Ololua Forest last week, Wednesday. Walking along by the river we caught two feeding parties almost at eye level and had great views of Slender-billed Greenbul, Black-backed Puff Back,Hartlaub's Turacos, Brown-backed Woodpecker and Northern Double-collared Sunbird. An African Goshawk, alighted infront of us twice and we heard but didn't see, Grey Olive Greenbuls down in the thickets near the river. In the undergrowth were Cabanis Greenbuls and White-starred Robin. We were very concerned to see the huge pipes which are being placed to take Mbagathi River Water to Karen Golf Club. Full list is in kenyabirdfinder <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.worldbirds.org">http://www.worldbirds.org</a>
