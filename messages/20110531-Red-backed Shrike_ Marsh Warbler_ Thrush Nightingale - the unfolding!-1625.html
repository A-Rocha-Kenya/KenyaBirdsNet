<br>Dear Kenyan Birders,
<br>I have just updated the post - on 31 May at 0845 GMT.
<br>
<br><a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://afrotropical.posterous.com/is-a-natural-east-africa-going-going-gone">http://afrotropical.posterous.com/is-a-natural-east-africa-going-going-gone</a>
<br>
<br>Please would you care to take a look at the rather worrying Russian report just-in regarding an absence of Red-backed Shrikes.
<br>It's from Konstantin Mikhailov - who has watched the River Oka for the past five years. The Oka is a tributary of the Volga, on the southern border of Moscow region.
<br>
<br>Best of birding to you all,
<br>James
<br>
<br>I've added the following note from here in Tanzania as well; please, any comments at all from Kenya would be most welcome (!!):
<br>
<br>Recent ENSO/IOD Events and their effects upon East Africa
<br>
<br>1997-1998: +IOD/El Niño [most intense ENSO event ever recorded] - locals say: "it rained all year" severe flooding across Kenya/Tanzania
<br>1998-1999: +IOD/El Niño - some continuation of above conditions -
<br>1999-2000:
<br>2000-2001:
<br>2001-2002:
<br>2002-2003: neutral (?)/El Niño
<br>2003-2004:
<br>2004-2005:
<br>2005-2006:
<br>2006-2007:+IOD/El Niño - flooding in Tanzania; the short 'vuli' rains continued from November well into the New Year of 2007
<br>2007-2008:+IOD/La Niña [NB: the only other recorded instance of this combination was in 1967] - wet into April 2008 in Tz
<br>2008-2009: neutral (?)/La Niña
<br>2009-2010: El Niño (slight)
<br>2010-2011: La Niña (moderate - ended in May 2011)
<br>
<br>IOD = Indian Ocean Dipole
<br>
<br>NB:
<br>In the two boreal winter seasons between 2006 - and - 2008 (both were +IOD/El Niño events) certain species, which typically winter in considerable numbers only well to the south of the central plateau of Tanzania, e.g.
<br>Amur Falcon, Corncrake, Red-backed Shrike and Thrush Nightingale were present in the Arusha area throughout the 'wintering' season. In addition wintering species such as Common Swift and White-winged Black Tern were present in unusual abundance along the coast at Tanga.
<br>This suggests that in wetter years some individuals of such species no longer 'feel the need' to follow the ITCZ into southern Africa. That, in effect, they "choose to fly less far to the south" and presumably therefore they benefit considerably from such wetter seasons. Unlike this two past "winter seasons"!
