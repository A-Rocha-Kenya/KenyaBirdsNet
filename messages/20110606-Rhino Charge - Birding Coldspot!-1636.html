We were excited about spending 4 days camping - an hour and a half northwest of Baringo, but it was a real disappointment!
It had rained, everything was green, some acacias were in flower but we only had a few Violet-backed and Beautiful Sunbirds.We were in a swamp, with some standing water, but the only birds to visit were Hammerkop, a Striated Heron and a female Knob-billed Duck. There were 7 species of doves/pigeons, a Brown Snake Eagle and of the more northern species we had just Jackson's Hornbill and Northern Brownbul. Numbers were also very low and what we saw hid quickly. Hard to explain! The highlight of the trip was a Pearl-spotted Owlet who sat in a small, bare, dead tree in front of us one hot afternoon.
