Hi Adam,
Breeding is regular in Plain Martin holes along the Mara, and we also
had them nest in Kichwa once when there was habitat along the
Sabaringo. June-July is the time when they breed in the Mara. In the
Kedong and Nakuru they breed in White-fronted Bee-eater holes.Best for
now
Brian

Hi All,

Having recorded a small party of Horus Swift apparently prospecting for nest
holes along the Mara River a few weeks ago, I've been equally surprised at
the numbers gathering around Naibor over the past week or so.

This morning I took a walk with an askari upstream from Naibor, along the
Talek River, and was amazed to see a flock of 40-50 birds wheeling around a
tall bank which certainly looked like they would be nesting there. So, 20-25
pairs maybe ... does anyone have records supporting breeding in this area
previously? During the same period last year, I recorded no sightings of
Horus Swift at all.

Most literature suggests they tend occur where White-fronted Bee-eaters
breed but with the exception of a single in camp last month I have not
recorded them in this part of the Mara before. I gather they are more
regular in the NW of the reserve though.

Any thoughts and comments warmly welcomed.

Other notes from camp; a pair of Swahili Sparrow are nesting above the mess
so a May egg month for anyone interested in the data. White-browed
Robin-chat have one chubby fledgling in camp, and the Yellow-spotted
Petronia pair seem to be preparing the Giraffe skull for a nest hole for the
second time.

Very best,

Adam
