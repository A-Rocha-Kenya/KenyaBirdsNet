&gt; holes along the Mara River a few weeks ago, I&#39;ve been equally surprised at<br>&gt; the numbers gathering around Naibor over the past week or so.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This morning I took a walk with an askari upstream from Naibor, along the<br>
&gt; Talek River, and was amazed to see a flock of 40-50 birds wheeling around a<br>&gt; tall bank which certainly looked like they would be nesting there. So, 20-25<br>&gt; pairs maybe ... does anyone have records supporting breeding in this area<br>
&gt; previously? During the same period last year, I recorded no sightings of<br>&gt; Horus Swift at all.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Most literature suggests they tend occur where White-fronted Bee-eaters<br>&gt; breed but with the exception of a single in camp last month I have not<br>
&gt; recorded them in this part of the Mara before. I gather they are more<br>&gt; regular in the NW of the reserve though.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Any thoughts and comments warmly welcomed.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Other notes from camp; a pair of Swahili Sparrow are nesting above the mess<br>
&gt; so a May egg month for anyone interested in the data. White-browed<br>&gt; Robin-chat have one chubby fledgling in camp, and the Yellow-spotted<br>&gt; Petronia pair seem to be preparing the Giraffe skull for a nest hole for the<br>
&gt; second time.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Very best,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Adam<br>&gt;<br></div></div></blockquote></div><br>
