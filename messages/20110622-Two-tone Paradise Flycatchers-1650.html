Greetings birders

In Gatamaiyu Forest on 19 June 2011, participants in Nature Kenya's Sunday
Birdwatch saw a male African Paradise Flycatcher near the Fisheries
campsite. Its back was rufous and its wings had a white patch as usual; but
its long central tail feathers were bright white.

Today 22 June at Rosslyn River Garden café and plant nursery, Wednesday
Morning Birdwatch participants saw an African Paradise Flycatcher with a
long rufous tail. But most of the wings were white.

Well, "Birds of East Africa" by Terry Stevenson and John Fanshawe states:
"Rufous birds with partially white wings and tail are also common."

Wishing you exciting birding, Fleur
