<div class="moz-text-flowed">Hi Tracy, James and all who have replied.
<br>
<br>We shall look at Samish Photolab in Yaya and see what they come up with. The Ornithology Dept. of Nature Kenya was the other offline recommendation that we got from James.
<br>
<br>Asanteni sana. Happy winter birding.
<br>

<br>We were recently recommended Samish Photolab in the Yaya Centre and they
<br>have my Bushnells there at the moment.&nbsp; They charge Shs 750:00 handling fee
<br>and send the binos to their workshop where a quote is given which you can
<br>accept or refuse.
<br>
<br>Sure there must be other places out there too, which I would also be
<br>interested to learn about, especially if they are the Thika side of Nairobi
<br>as Yaya is difficult for us to get to - and still remain sane.

<br>
<br>Good day netters.
<br>
<br>Hope that you are all well and enjoying some winter birding.
<br>
<br>I apologise if this has been asked earlier, but my wife and I are new
<br>on the kenyabirdnet. My wife needs some slight repair work done on her
<br>Pentax binoculars. Nothing major-the rubber housing of her eyepiece
<br>came loose, and will need some good quality gluing work done on it.
<br>The eyepiece itself also needs some serious lubrication, and the one
<br>lubricant that I tried does not seem to have done the trick.
<br>
<br>Anyone know of a good store I could go to here in Nairobi that can
<br>help me out?
<br>
<br>Thanks in advance.
<br>Felix
