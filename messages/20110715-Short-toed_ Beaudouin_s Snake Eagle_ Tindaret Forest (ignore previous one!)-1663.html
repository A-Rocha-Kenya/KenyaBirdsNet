Sorry for the previous email but it was sent before completion!<br><br>Hi All,<div class="gmail_quote">

<div>Vicki and I are back from an 8-day break up-country having spent 4 nights at Rondo Retreat, Kakamega,and 4 nights at the Barnley&#39;s near Kitale. Lots of wonderful sightings that I&#39;ll write up soon but I just wanted to flag up the best bird of the trip which we saw as we were heading back towards Nakuru on 5th July - a fine Short-toed Eagle sp (looking very much like <i>C.g.gallicus</i> but maybe more likely to be <i>beaudouini</i> given the time of year) as we passed through the southern section of Tindaret Forest. On locating the bird it was circling right next to the road but by the time I had taken the camera out from the back of the car it had soared high and far off but I still managed some shots that I am hopeful will prove the validity of the record.<br>
<br>Find terribly distant images attached (possibly the worst ever on this forum due to the fact it was probably 1.5km away!). They are full res but only occupy less 0.5% of the frame.<br><br>Best,<br><br>Adam<br></div>
