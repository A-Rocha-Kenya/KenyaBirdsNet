It was very cool and did not warm up until very late morning.<br>We started at KWS Hippo Camp where in spite of our having our pre-paid<br>KWS Smart Cards, the girl at the gate insisted on further proof of<br>identity. It seems that they don’t trust their own identification<br>system away from the Smart-Card zone.<br>The area was in beautiful condition and will be very attractive to<br>migrants when the numbers start to appear
 in a months time. The nicest<br>birds present were a pair of Great Crested Grebes in fine plumage and<br>giving short displays of head shaking, but nothing too energetic.<br>Amongst the fine assortment of waterbirds was nothing to raise the<br>pulse-rate, but some waders had returned. There were three Ruff, three<br>Marsh Sandpipers of which one was in bland non-breeding dress, but two<br>retained the black spotting of breeding adults and had probably just<br>returned, likewise of two Greenshank, one was spotty and one plain,<br>five Wood Sandpipers were white spotted adults and recent arrivals, as<br>were three Common Sandpipers. However the six Black-tailed Godwits<br>present showed no traces of breeding colour and may never have left<br>the country this season. Amongst the numerous Whiskered Terns were one<br>White-winged Black Tern but no Gull-bills. Other birds here were a<br>juvenile Jacobin Cuckoo, four White-fronted Bee-eaters and
 two<br>Grey-rumped Swallows. From here we went to Oloidien and had some<br>coffee at the Crater Lodge. The flamingos here were reduced to one<br>Greater and six Lesser. The birds in the garden were more interesting<br>with Schalow’s Wheatears so tame that they come into the dining room,<br>and African Firefinch coming to bathe at the bird bath with their<br>commoner relatives. The White-eyes in the area are fairly common and<br>all appear to be Yellow, which is not too unexpected. We were<br>imitating Pearl-spotted Owlets to see if any Grey-crested<br>Helmetshrikes were within hearing distance. We called in over thirty<br>species as well as two owlets, but no Helmetshrikes. We did however<br>call in a male Northern Puffback which is the furthest south I have<br>seen the species in Kenya. Interestingly not only does Britton not<br>mention it for northern Naivasha, but he doesn’t even recognise it<br>further south than Eldama Ravine, when it is so
 numerous in Lake<br>Nakuru NP! He does however list the Yellow White-eye as occurring as<br>far south and east as Naivasha.<br>On the Small Lake Naivasha, there were lots of both Flamingos, around<br>two-hundred Cape Teal and seventy Southern Pochard which partly<br>explains their absence at Nakuru. There were five adult Common<br>Sandpipers and two patternless Greenshank, and two breeding plumaged<br>White-winged Black Terns amongst the Whiskered present.<br>Horus and Nyanza Swifts came down to drink in the late afternoon.<br>A stop in Dagoretti Market to buy Wellington boots was fortunate not<br>only for the successful purchase, but for finding a pair of Angola<br>Swallows on the buildings. A species rarely recorded near Nairobi.<br>After leaving Nigel I was driving down Bogani East Road in Langata,<br>when I came to a halt because the wire had detached itself from the<br>coil. Whilst I was getting myself road-worthy again in the fast fading<br>light,
 a Bat Hawk flew over the road, then disappeared back the way it<br>had come!<br>Best to all<br>Brian<br><br><br></div></div></div></body></html>
