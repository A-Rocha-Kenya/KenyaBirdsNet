<div>Hi All,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Nothing of huge significance around camp but a few nice things to keep the manager&#39;s binoculars in motion...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On the evening of 21st, we had a pair of Grey-headed Bushshrikes AND a Sulphur-breasted Bushshrike in the same bush outside of our tent! Sadly it was getting too dark for images but a great sight. The Grey-headeds were quite agressive towards the Sulphur-breasted.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>Nightjar numbers are picking up in the area of the camp; I make a vigil at the main car park most evenings to keep an eye on the skies and had 4 Slender-tails in one go the other evening, and my askari noted a good gathering between us and Rekero Camp (along the Talek River) when he was on duty, maybe as many of 7 together. My askari collected a dead nightjar (female Square-tailed) from a track not far from camp, which was possibly a road-kill but it had no signs of damage anywhere and there&#39;s minimal traffic at night-time here, so maybe something else. Still no sign of a Pennant-winged but I&#39;m hoping it will come soon...</div>

<div> </div>
<div>In camp today, a young Greater Honeyguide is making a big noise and being fed by a Ruppell&#39;s Long-tailed Starling. Not sure if that&#39;s unusual or not, as I thought barbets were the preferred hosts? No barbets local to the camp so maybe they&#39;ve opted for another choice of host?</div>

<div> </div>
<div>Very best,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Adam</div>
