Sorry for the late posting, but I only became a member of kenyabirdsnet today after my return to California from a month-long visit to East Africa.

On 21 July 2011, while birding the Athi River Catchment Area just 200 meters upstream from the bridge crossing, I noticed a group of 7 shorebirds:  5 Curlew Sandpipers, 1 Common Sandpiper, and 1 Pectoral Sandpiper.   I thought the later to be most unusual species from my rather experience of many visits to Kenya so I check its status in Stevenson and Fanshawe's
Birds of East Africa.   Seeing its extreme rarity (3 records), I took a number of photos which I will be glad to share.

I am very familiar with this species from extensive experience with it in North America.  I would be glad to write up a rare bird report and submit photos if given the venue to use.

Again, I apologize for the late listing of this species.  Now that I am a member of kenyabirdsnet, I will quickly report any rarities during my travels to East Africa in 2012.

Good birding to all,

Ed Harper
