Dear Birders,<BR>
Am taking this oppournity to let others know that, as earlier indicated by Brian finch Mail sometime back of the presence of Great Crested Grebe in Lake Naivasha near Kws station, this time I was in the lake on 9th August early morning with a boat ride on the Middle part of the lake I found 4 of them good view for almost 9yrs since I last saw this birds.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
I proceeded later to Baringo and on 10th Morning on normal bird walk I managed to spot (Spotted Eagle owl) with Yellow eyes as well the Greyish Eagle Owl with the Dark eyes and which is now a seperate species, First time I would say to see this species with Yellow eyes which we earlier had percived to only occur south of Equator. I do not know if others have been keen to spot this species here before???<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Wishing you all happy birding time!<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Regards,<BR>
