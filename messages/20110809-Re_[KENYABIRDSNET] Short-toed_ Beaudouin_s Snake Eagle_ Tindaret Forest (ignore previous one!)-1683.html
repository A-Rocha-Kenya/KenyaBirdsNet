Hi Adam,
I have looked at the images, but it is a real pity that it got so far
before the camera went into action. The date would suggest a
Beaudouin, the tail-banding is perfect for a Short-toed/Beaudouin but
although it is indistinct, the undertail coverts give the impression
of being pale and plain, not barred which leans more to a Short-toed.
I really would not like to put money on this. You could send the
images to Simon Thomsett on <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:sthomsett@gmail.com">&lt;sthomsett@gmail.com&gt;</a>
or Bill Clarke on <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:raptours@earthlink.net">raptours@earthlink.net</a>, and if they can’t help you no-one can.
Best for now
Brian

Sorry for the previous email but it was sent before completion!

Hi All,

Vicki and I are back from an 8-day break up-country having spent 4 nights at
Rondo Retreat, Kakamega,and 4 nights at the Barnley's near Kitale. Lots of
wonderful sightings that I'll write up soon but I just wanted to flag up the
best bird of the trip which we saw as we were heading back towards Nakuru on
5th July - a fine Short-toed Eagle sp (looking very much like
*C.g.gallicus*but maybe more likely to be
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>beaudouini<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> given the time of year) as we passed through the southern
section of Tindaret Forest. On locating the bird it was circling right next
to the road but by the time I had taken the camera out from the back of the
car it had soared high and far off but I still managed some shots that I am
hopeful will prove the validity of the record.

Find terribly distant images attached (possibly the worst ever on this forum
due to the fact it was probably 1.5km away!). They are full res but only
occupy less 0.5% of the frame.

Best,

Adam
