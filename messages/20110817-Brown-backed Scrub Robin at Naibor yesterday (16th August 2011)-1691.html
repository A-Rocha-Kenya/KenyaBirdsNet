Hi All,<br><br>A great new bird for the Masai Mara National Reserve (well, east of the Mara River anyway) and a lifer for me.<br><br>We experienced exceptionally heavy rain yesterday afternoon and while sitting undercover outside my tent, a small bird flew next to me (distance maybe 3metres max) and sang a short little melody. It sounded quite similar to White-browed Scrub Robin (WbSR) but appeared <u>very</u> greyish on the head and chest (our local WbSRs are usually warmer in tone). Two obvious wing bars were clearly seen (no further white on edges to greater coverts present) and although its not uncommon to see WbSR with just two wing bars, this bird looked very different and especially &quot;bland&quot;. After it hopped from view, I grabbed the ipod and speaker and played the Brown-backed song, which was identical to what I had just heard. It didn&#39;t reappear sadly, despite also trying WbSC and then Pearl-spotetd Owlet calls.<br>
<br>Brian had reported seeing and hearing this species at Sabaringo Valley earlier this year, so maybe we have an eastward extension in progress, similar to that of Swamp Nightjar?<br><br>Very best,<br><br>Adam<br>ps - Brian - thanks for this tip-off!<br>
