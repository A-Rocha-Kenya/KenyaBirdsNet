It was cold and overcast and<br>remained so all day, with intermittent very light drizzle, until I<br>left at 1.00pm.<br>There was absolutely nothing to be seen in these bleak and dark<br>conditions until reaching Hyena Dam. The Lesser Moorhen was feeding in<br>the dry short grass around the dam, and seems totally oblivious to any<br>presence now being much tamer than any Common Moorhen. A pair of<br>African Water Rails were poking along the edge of the swamp,
 an<br>agitated Swamphen was glowing in the dull light, calling from a<br>platform of reeds, and a Madagascar Pond Heron was also here. The only<br>migrant waders were two Wood Sandpipers, in fact the only ones of<br>their kind all morning (and no Green).&nbsp; In the Hyena Dam run-off area<br>were a male Saddle-billed Stork, more noisy African Water Rails and<br>about five Rosy-breasted Longclaws plus the usual single Yellow-billed<br>and Great Egrets.<br>There was an adult Black-chested Snake-Eagle near Karen PS Dam<br>otherwise nothing different until Athi Dam. Here there were two adult<br>White Pelicans, a couple of adult Black-crowned Night-Herons on the<br>causeway, two Black-winged Stilt, fifteen Kittlitz’s and one<br>Spur-winged Plover, but the only palearctics (apart from two Barn<br>Swallows), were five Little Stint and two Common Sandpiper. There was<br>a group of seven Hamerkop which is an unusual concentration. The most<br>remarkable
 observation was no less that one-hundred and fifty-five<br>Yellow-throated Sandgrouse around the edge of the dam. Not only the<br>largest flock recorded for Nairobi, but an impressive gathering<br>anywhere.<br>Continuing to Cheetah Gate there was a Grey-headed Kingfisher on a<br>fence-post, and a couple of Speckle-fronted Weavers. At Cheetah Gate<br>on the track to the Mbagathi River there was little of note apart from<br>a few Lesser Masked Weavers, however a woman working in a vegetable<br>field flushed a small francolin which flew right past me into the Park<br>and dropped down amongst small acacias. I could see that it had a red<br>tail and a buffy face with a crescent mark and was no doubt a female<br>or immature male Coqui Francolin.<br>This seemed completely outrageous, because the last family known for<br>any vagrancy are the francolins, not that they are not strong and fast<br>fliers (especially Coqui), but historically the bird used to
 be<br>resident in the Machakos area, in fact it was widespread to the East<br>of Nairobi. The population died out over much of the range, and the<br>species has not been reported from Machakos for many decades to the<br>best of my knowledge. It is possible however that a few undetected<br>birds hang on tenaciously on some of the ranches. The closest I have<br>seen the bird to Nairobi is in the Whistling Thorn scrub in the Kedong<br>Valley. Nevertheless, Coqui Francolin is not only a new bird for<br>Nairobi National Park, but Nairobi City region.<br><br>The cold weather not only made birds reticent to move, but the only<br>mammal of note was a Black Rhinoceros at Athi Dam. This area boasted<br>most of the plains game, and Thomson’s and Grant’s Gazelles were<br>numerous from there to the “Beacon.”<br><br>Best to all<br>Brian<br><br><br></div></div></div></body></html>
