Hi All,<br><br>Just a quick line to report a new bird for the Naibor Camp list - a Black-crowned Night Heron seen well yesterday morning at the start of a productive bird walk with a guest. We also had great scope views of a Grey/Grey-headed Woodpecker family consisting of a pair with two well fledged young birds. Although these local birds are seen only occasionally in camp, they must be nesting close by.<br>
<br>Out of interest, what is the latest &quot;chapter and verse&quot; on the split of these woodpecker species/ subspecies? Are we more likely to encounter Grey-headed in this area? Both adults showed a red streak in the belly if that helps?<br>
<br>Many thanks,<br><br>Adam<br><br>
