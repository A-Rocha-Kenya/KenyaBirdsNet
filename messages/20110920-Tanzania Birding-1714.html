<br>
<br>Hope that you are all well.
<br>
<br>I would like to obtain some informtion on behalf of a friend. Two colleagues of mine are flying to Kenya from S. Africa, with a view of doing some birding in Tanzania (my wife and I would have LOVED to join them, but we will be expecting our first child around then.) They will targetting 3 main birding locations: East Usambara Mts, Amani Mt Reserve, Uluguru.
<br>
<br>There are three main questions that I would appreciate input on:
<br>
<br>-Does anyone know of recommended local guides who can help in any of the three locations?
<br>-Lastly, what birder-friendly accomodation exists in any of these three areas?
<br>-Are there any mp3s of East African bird calls? They are looking particularly for the ones for the Tanzanian birds.
<br>
<br>Any input will be highly appreciated.
<br>
<br>Kind regards,
<br>Felix
