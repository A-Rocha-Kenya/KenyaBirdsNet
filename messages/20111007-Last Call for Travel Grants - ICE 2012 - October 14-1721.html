<div class="headline_area" style="text-align: left;color: rgb(17, 17, 17);font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: 10px;"><h1 style="font-size: 2.2em;font-weight: normal;">Call for travel grant applications</h1></div><div class="format_text" style="text-align: left;font-size: 1.4em;font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><p style="color: rgb(17, 17, 17);">Recognition of the central role of indigenous peoples in all global, regional, and local processes is a founding element of the ISE. Supporting and promoting the critical efforts of Indigenous peoples, traditional societies, and local communities in the conservation of biological, cultural and linguistic diversity has been the priority since the ISE's inception in 1988.</p><p style="color: rgb(17, 17, 17);">Building on the traditions of past ISE congresses, the 13th ISE Congress will bring together indigenous and non-indigenous participants from around the world to tackle the key issues of our times, such as community-conserved areas and food sovereignty.&nbsp;<strong>The congress will include a wide range of formats for people to share their knowledge, ideas and experiences, ranging from talking circles, to film viewings and discussions, cultural performances, field trips, oral presentations and poster sessions.</strong>&nbsp;The congress is intended to be highly interactive and participatory and to foster a commitment by participants to building understanding and trust.</p><p style="color: rgb(17, 17, 17);">The overarching theme of the 13th Congress is&nbsp;<strong>Cultural diversity and biological diversity for sustainable development: Exploring the past to build the future</strong>. The main keywords upon which we would like to draw the Congress topics are the following:&nbsp;<em style="font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">biocultural interactions</em>,&nbsp;<em style="font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">coupled human and ecological systems</em>,&nbsp;<em style="font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">historical ecology</em>,&nbsp;<em style="font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">cultural landscapes,</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">socio-ecological resilience</em>.</p><p style="color: rgb(17, 17, 17);">In preparation for this congress, to be held in Montpellier, France from 20-25 May 2012, the ISE is announcing a&nbsp;<strong>Call for travel grant applications to support contributions from indigenous peoples and local/traditional communities</strong>&nbsp;as follows:</p><p style="color: rgb(17, 17, 17);"><strong>Proposals for travel grant applications to support individual contributions will ideally fall within one of the sub-themes of the 13th congress:</strong></p><ol style="color: rgb(17, 17, 17);"><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Local products</span>: Interactions between rural and urban environments</li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Agrodiversity</span>: Interactions between past and contemporary agricultural practices</li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Land use legacies</span>: Interactions between past knowledge and contemporary practices</li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Co-learning processes in ethnobiological research</span>: Interactions between researchers, local actors, and other stakeholders</li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sustainable development</span>: Interactions between traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and environmental norms/policies</li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advocacy</span>: Interactions between ethnobiologists and the media</li></ol><p style="color: rgb(17, 17, 17);"><a href="http://congress-ise2012.agropolis.fr/" target="_blank" class="external external_icon" style="text-decoration: none;color: rgb(19, 19, 242);background-attachment: initial;background-color: initial;">Read more details about these themes</a>. Contributions that do not fall within one of the 6 sub-themes are also welcome.</p><p style="color: rgb(17, 17, 17);">Additionally, an&nbsp;<strong>Indigenous Forum</strong>&nbsp;will be an integral part of the 13th Congress. This dedicated Forum during the congress will have facilitated gatherings, as well as "open space" with the intention to allow a diverse group of people to deal with complex and potentially conflicting material in innovative and productive ways. The Forum will run as a parallel stream during the Congress, culminating in a plenary session on the last day when recommendations will be shared with all Congress participants. The proposed focus for the 2012 Indigenous Forum will explore how the UN Declaration for Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) can be broadened into actionable steps. Travel grant applicants are encouraged to participate in the Indigenous Forum. If you would like to propose a contribution (including, but not limited to storytelling, round table, demonstration, film, or poster) or a discussion topic that you would like to lead as part of the Indigenous Forum, please indicate this in your proposal.</p><p style="color: rgb(17, 17, 17);"><strong>Support available:&nbsp;</strong><br>A limited number of travel bursaries (typically up to $2000 USD per participant) are available to&nbsp;<em style="font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">off­set</em>direct expenses (transportation, hotel, meals, registration) for attending the 13th ISE Congress in France. Bursaries above $2000 USD will be considered only with justified financial need and when other funds are not reasonably available. In the event that only partial funding can be provided, the applicants will be contacted to see if their participation will still be possible.</p><p style="color: rgb(17, 17, 17);">Note that travel should be based on the most economical options. It is recommended that international travel be booked into one of the main airport hubs, with transport to Montpellier scheduled by train. The Congress organizers will provide accommodations within the Montpellier community; additional expenses for food and incidentals are estimated at $40 USD per day.</p><p style="color: rgb(17, 17, 17);"><strong>Qualifications:&nbsp;</strong><br>Support is available for&nbsp;<strong>indigenous and local people&nbsp;</strong>who are&nbsp;<strong>members of the ISE&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>involved in ethnobiology at the community or grassroots level</strong>.
