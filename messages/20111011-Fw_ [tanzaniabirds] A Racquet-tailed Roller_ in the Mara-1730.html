      <div>I'm interested in this - it's a lovely bird! But there's so much white <br>
on the forehead I can't see it immediately as anything but Abyssinian? <br>
What's the Racket-tailed feature I'm looking for?<br>

&gt; Dear all,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; an Israeli Photographer, Eyal Bar-tov has recently came back from<br>
&gt; leading a tour in Kenya where he photographed on the 14/08/2011 at 09:50<br>
&gt; between Keekorok and the Mara River the attached Roller photo.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; When i saw the photo i remembered seeing strange pale looking Roller in<br>
&gt; the area between Sekenani and Talek, (not far from Simba Lodge) while<br>
&gt; guiding a general wildlife group back in Aug 2004. at the time i<br>
&gt; dismissed it as a probable Abyssinian, but never thought about<br>
&gt; Racket-tailed...<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; This new bird looks very good for a Racquet-tailed Roller, though the<br>
&gt; closest record for the species is about 1300 km to the south (Neil<br>
&gt; please correct me if i'm wrong).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; It will be great to have more records from others who might have strange<br>
&gt; looking Rollers at the Mara.<br>

&gt; Here are comments from Don, Colin and Brian:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Hi Itai,<br>
&gt; I am still on safari, but tonight on wi-fi. Your roller is absolutely<br>
&gt; astounding. The bird looks small, the bill is slight, the extensive<br>
&gt; white forehead and forecrown, broad white eye brow, the contrasting<br>
&gt; black line from side of nape to and through eye, complete lack of<br>
&gt; visible blue on wing, brown of back extending as same colour to back<br>
&gt; of nape and neck, all blue underparts, I can see no reason why this is<br>
&gt; not a blue form of Racquet-tailed Roller regardless of the lack of<br>
&gt; racquets!<br>
&gt; Exactly where was this? Are there any more images!<br>
&gt; Best for now<br>
&gt; Brian<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Itai - a beautiful shot of a lovely bird - and as Don says, quite a<br>
&gt; mystery. I wonder if any other images of the bird from different angles<br>
&gt; would reveal any other features? The blue underparts certainly don't<br>
&gt; resemble Lilac-breasted - far too rich. A real beaut of a bird... Would<br>
&gt; be good to have it seen and photographed some more. You say you think<br>
&gt; you've seen birds like this before in Mara? In the same area that this<br>
&gt; bird was found? All very interesting...<br>
&gt; Colin<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; An amazing image. I don't think there is any Lilac-breasted R. in this<br>
&gt; bird. Its odd that the wings appear not to show any violet or blue. Head<br>
&gt; and underparts resemble the nominate form of Racquet-tailed, but not the<br>
&gt; upperparts so there is clearly a mix, but of what ?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; What date was this photo taken, and roughly where in the Mara. Any other<br>
&gt; rollers nearby ?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; In the past there have been a few odd-looking Abyssinian as far south as<br>
&gt; the Mara and northern Serengeti that have become lost individuals. If<br>
&gt; they did hybridize with Lilac-breasted would the underparts be as rich a<br>
&gt; blue as this bird ?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Total mystery, lets hope it gets donated to science.<br>
&gt; Don<br>

&gt; I'd rather go birding...<br>
