<div>Hi All,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This really is terrific. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>It&#39;s certainly &quot;spatulatus&quot; race of Racket-tailed Roller that we had in Katavi NP (see poor image of one of the local birds from a few years back, along with an old digiscoped shot off Abyssinian from The Gambia for comparison. </div>

<div> </div>
<div>The brown hindneck is the clincher along with the &quot;baby-blue&quot; underparts which is quite different to the &quot;aquamarine&quot; of the Abyssinain. The &quot;deep-purple&quot; shoulder patch is hidden by the fluffed up chest feathers and it&#39;s common for adults to lose their &quot;rackets&quot; in the southern winter.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>It doesn&#39;t help that Fanshawe and Steveson only show weigalli race in their guide, even though spatulatus is not uncommon in the miombo of south west of Tanzania. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Bit of a shame that news of this bird was not put out on the grapevine sooner... even Abyssinian would have been an excellent Mara record and worthy of a trip out but a 1st for Kenya is certainly the one that got away!</div>

<div> </div>
<div>Neil - I remember the debate about spatulatus-v-weigalli from TZ a few years ago - was that in Katavi or Selous (I think the latter). The images suggested spatulatus but weigalli was to be expected there... something like that. </div>

<div> </div>
<div>Also, does anyone have any thoughts why it was never spelt &quot;Racquet&quot; as one might expect?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Cheers and best</div>

<div>Dear all,</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>an Israeli Photographer, Eyal Bar-tov has recently came back from leading a tour in Kenya where he photographed on the 14/08/2011 at 09:50 between Keekorok and the Mara River the attached Roller photo.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>When i saw the photo i remembered seeing strange pale looking Roller in the area between Sekenani and Talek, (not far from Simba Lodge) while guiding a general wildlife group back in Aug 2004. at the time i dismissed it as a probable Abyssinian, but never thought about Racket-tailed... </div>

<div><br></div>
<div>This new bird looks very good for a Racquet-tailed Roller, though the closest record for the species is about 1300 km to the south (Neil please correct me if i&#39;m wrong).</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>It will be great to have more records from others who might have strange looking Rollers at the Mara.</div>
<div>Itai</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Here are comments from Don, Colin and Brian:</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Hi Itai,<br></div>
<div>I am still on safari, but tonight on wi-fi. Your roller is absolutely</div>
<div>astounding. The bird looks small, the bill is slight, the extensive</div>
<div>white forehead and forecrown, broad white eye brow, the contrasting</div>
<div>black line from side of nape to and through eye, complete lack of</div>
<div>visible blue on wing, brown of back extending as same colour to back</div>
<div>of nape and neck, all blue underparts, I can see no reason why this is</div>
<div>not a blue form of Racquet-tailed Roller regardless of the lack of</div>
<div>racquets!</div>
<div>Exactly where was this? Are there any more images!</div>
<div>Best for now</div>
<div>Brian</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Itai - a beautiful shot of a lovely bird - and as Don says, quite a mystery. I wonder if any other images of the bird from different angles would reveal any other features? The blue underparts certainly don&#39;t resemble Lilac-breasted - far too rich. A real beaut of a bird... Would be good to have it seen and photographed some more. You say you think you&#39;ve seen birds like this before in Mara? In the same area that this bird was found? All very interesting...</div>

<div>Colin</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>An amazing image.    I don&#39;t think there is any Lilac-breasted R. in this bird.  Its odd that the wings appear not to show any violet or blue.    Head and underparts resemble the nominate form of Racquet-tailed, but not the upperparts  so there is clearly a mix, but of what ?</div>

<div><br></div>
<div>What date was this photo taken, and roughly where in the Mara.  Any other rollers nearby ?</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>In the past there have been a few odd-looking Abyssinian as far south as the Mara and northern Serengeti that have become lost individuals. If they did hybridize with Lilac-breasted would the underparts be as rich a blue as this bird ?</div>

<div><br></div>
<div>Total mystery, lets hope it gets donated to science.</div>
