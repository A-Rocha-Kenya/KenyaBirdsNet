Dear Birds,

Between 12th October and 14th October I visited Kakamega Forest.I did witnessed one of the most spectacular raptr migration in western Kenya. On the evening of 12th(Wednesday) 5.00pm, I counted about 800( eight hundret) Steppe Buzzards, about 10 Honey Buzzards, 15 Steppe Eagles and 5 Leser spotted Eagles. This was around the Ikuywa River. As the sun came down, the birds decended down on the trees in the forest. It was difficult to see them at roost since they were away from the road.The decision to visit the Liranda Hill did not yeald much because we came here aroun 09:0 am on 13th when the birds had started migration around 08:00 am. However, I 0 counted about 200 steppe Buzzards and 3 Steppe Eagles. On Liranda I observed a single Eurasian Roller, a flock of Barn Swallows and House Martins. Will share more on Kenya Birdfinder,

Thanks

Titus Imboma
