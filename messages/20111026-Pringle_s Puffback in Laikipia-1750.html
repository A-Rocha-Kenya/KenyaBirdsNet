I found the following bird (attached photo) which appears to be a Pringle&#39;s. I got a photo of the female but I didn&#39;t get the male.  Anyway, I would love to hear if I got this wrong or, if it is a Pringle&#39;s where the closest known population is to here in East Laikipia. We are at over 1600 meters and the books say Pringle&#39;s only go up to 1200 meters.<br>
<br>A few other bird observations that we have had is:<br><br>Lizard Buzzard (about a week ago on the Ewaso Nyiro River across from Mpala)<br><br>Alpine Swift (2 months back with some mottled swifts above our offices)<br>
<br>Lastly, I have attached a bird that I can&#39;t seem to recognize. It has been coming to our birdbath and I feel like it is something common but wearing a plumage I&#39;m just not recognizing. Whydah ? Thanks for any ideas. <br clear="all">
