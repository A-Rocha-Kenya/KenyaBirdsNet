<div class="moz-text-flowed">Friday saw us doing our October wader count at Sabaki. Clear skies and 
hot conditions though rain the day before meant it could have been 
hotter. Good numbers of birds around in general and waders out in force 
- particularly Curlew Sandpipers and 47 Broad-billed Sandpiper. It's 
very interesting with these guys - invariably they are pretty much all 
in one spot together rather than spread out and scattered across the 
river mouth. Beaut little waders and a treat to see up close. The main 
species of note was two 'Oiks' - Eurasian Oystercatchers, the first I've 
seen at Sabaki for a couple of years now. Otherwise a good scattering of 
Sand Martins was nice and a couple of Yellow Wagtails. An African Reed 
Warbler was singing loudly in the newly invaded mangrove forest out 
towards the mouth of the river. All the Crab-plovers have disappeared 
(there were almost 300 in August) and apparently left after the heavy 
rain a couple of weeks ago.
<br>
<br>In Watamu, Red-capped Robin Chats are more vocal with the lead up to 
their departure next month back to their breeding sites. Osprey seen 
being mobbed a hundred metres out from the beach by a House Crow which 
flew out specifically just to mob the Osprey - for no apparent reason 
other than 'bad attitude'. A count in Watamu tonight produced over 300 
birds - but it would be very much worse had it not been for 3-4 crow 
traps being operated by the Watamu Association which have caught and 
killed over 700 crows since the start of the year.
<br>
<br>Conditions are ideal for wader ringing - anyone interested to come and 
assist and join in should contact me - we'll be going this week on 
Thursday and Friday nights (3rd &amp; 4th Nov).
