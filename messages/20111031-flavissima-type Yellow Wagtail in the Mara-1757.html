Hi All,<br><br>While returning from Naboisho Camp in the new Naboisho Conservancy to Naibor on 29th October, I noticed two bright Yellow Wagtails, the second of which I managed to photograph (see attached). <br><br>To my eye, this appears identical to the &quot;British&quot; Yellow Wagtail <i>Motacilla flava flavissima</i> but I have always thought that this subspecies over-wintered in western and central Africa? I have seen no mention of <i>flavissima</i> in Zimmerman or F&amp;S and wondered A) if this is actually a flaisssima, and B) if so, it is probably a good record?<br>
<br>Also, yesterday morning (30th), there were several Steppe Eagle over the southern grassy plains of the Mara and a <i>migrans</i> Black Kite. In the evening, just outside of Naibor, I witnessed the heaviest passage of swifts and hirundines I have ever seen. Literally clouds of birds pouring overhead and no doubt feasting on the termite swarms that have been emerging over the past few days. Hard to estimate numbers but probably 5000+ in one tight flock alone. The swifts all appeared to be Common and the hirundines consisted mostly of Barn Swallow and a few mixed martins. An awesome example of visual migration that took ones breath away!<br>
<br>Off to the coast today...!<br><br>Cheers and best,<br><br>Adam<br><br><br><br><br><div style="visibility: hidden; left: -5000px; position: absolute; z-index: 9999; padding: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px; overflow: hidden; word-wrap: break-word; color: black; font-size: 10px; text-align: left; line-height: 130%;" id="avg_ls_inline_popup">
