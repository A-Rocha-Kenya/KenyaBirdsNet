<div class="moz-text-flowed">There has been a superb passage of bee-eaters and terns the first few 
days of this week - probably 1000+ Blue-cheeked and Eurasian went 
through on Monday morning alone (during our staff meeting...!) and there 
must have been several 1000 terns, mostly Common moving south, but also 
LEsser Crested and Saunders'. In fact there have been quite a number of 
Common that have died from exhaustion - picked up and and brought to us 
with no pectoral muscle left on them at all and clearly fully exhausted 
before they died.
<br>
<br>Today a few flocks of Blue-cheeked and as I tap a flock of 
White-throated Bee-eaters have perched on the casuarina in front of the 
A Rocha Kenya centre and look stunning through the 'scope.
<br>
<br>We head to Mida tonight and tomorrow for more wader ringing - assisted 
by Niko Gerhaut and his team (and with 30m nets to add to ours... !) - 
so it will be interesting!
<br>
<br>An excellent trip to Dakatcha last week looking for Clarke's Weavers 
nesting - only one flock of them seen and no sign of breeding, but 
plenty of other interesting records including an adult Honey Buzzard. 
Will try and post more about this in due course.
