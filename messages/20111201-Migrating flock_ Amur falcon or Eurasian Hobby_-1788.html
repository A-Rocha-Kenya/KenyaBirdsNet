<div class="moz-text-flowed">Goodmorning all.
<br>
<br>Yesterday evening (Wednesday 30th November), two friends and I witnessed what looked like migration of falcons. Literally hundreds (500+) of them were flying overhead, moving in a roughly north-westerly direction. We witnessed this from my mum and dad's home in Hardy, Karen. I was overawed by the sight, seeing that it was my first time seeing such a large migrating flock.
<br>
<br>Did anyone else see this yesterday? I would also appreciate help in confirming that it was indeed Amur falcons that I saw, and not, say, Eurasian hobbies. The sky was overcast, and so the lighting was not that great. The distinctiveness of the falcon silhouette was however clearly visible, but the two-toned underside wing of the Amur was not very evident. In at least two birds, I observed a white throat patch, suggesting the E. Hobby, but the dusk light made it difficult to observe much more than that. Does anyone know if the two travel together?
<br>
<br>Looking forward to hearing what the experts have to say.
<br>
