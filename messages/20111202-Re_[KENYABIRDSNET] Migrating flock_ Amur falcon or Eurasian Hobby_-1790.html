Dear Felix,
I am sure they would have been Amurs, Eurasian Hobbies to not
associate in such large congregations. Female and immature Amurs look
quite hobby-like with the pale throat and in dark skies the underwing
contrast of the male is not as evident as in clear skies.
A very good record for Nairobi.
Best for now
Brian

Goodmorning all.

Yesterday evening (Wednesday 30th November), two friends and I
witnessed what looked like migration of falcons. Literally hundreds
(500+) of them were flying overhead, moving in a roughly north-
westerly direction. We witnessed this from my mum and dad's home in
Hardy, Karen. I was overawed by the sight, seeing that it was my first
time seeing such a large migrating flock.

Did anyone else see this yesterday? I would also appreciate help in
confirming that it was indeed Amur falcons that I saw, and not, say,
Eurasian hobbies. The sky was overcast, and so the lighting was not
that great. The distinctiveness of the falcon silhouette was however
clearly visible, but the two-toned underside wing of the Amur was not
very evident. In at least two birds, I observed a white throat patch,
suggesting the E. Hobby, but the dusk light made it difficult to
observe much more than that. Does anyone know if the two travel
together?

Looking forward to hearing what the experts have to say.

Felix
