<div class="moz-text-flowed">Dear Brian.
<br>
<br>Thanks for your valuable insight. I also suspect that the bulk of the flock was Amurs, and did not get a good enough look at the others to conclude that there were some eurasian hobbies.
<br>
<br>Regards,

<br>I am sure they would have been Amurs, Eurasian Hobbies to not

<br>A very good record for Nairobi.
<br>Best for now

<br>Yesterday evening (Wednesday 30th November), two friends and I
<br>witnessed what looked like migration of falcons. Literally hundreds
<br>(500+) of them were flying overhead, moving in a roughly north-
<br>westerly direction. We witnessed this from my mum and dad's home in
<br>Hardy, Karen. I was overawed by the sight, seeing that it was my first
<br>time seeing such a large migrating flock.
<br>
<br>Did anyone else see this yesterday? I would also appreciate help in
<br>confirming that it was indeed Amur falcons that I saw, and not, say,
<br>Eurasian hobbies. The sky was overcast, and so the lighting was not
<br>that great. The distinctiveness of the falcon silhouette was however
<br>clearly visible, but the two-toned underside wing of the Amur was not
<br>very evident. In at least two birds, I observed a white throat patch,
<br>suggesting the E. Hobby, but the dusk light made it difficult to
<br>observe much more than that. Does anyone know if the two travel
<br>together?
<br>
<br>Looking forward to hearing what the experts have to say.

<br>Felix
