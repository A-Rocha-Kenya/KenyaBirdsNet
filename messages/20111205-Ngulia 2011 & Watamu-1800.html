    The ringing session for Ngulia 2011 finished today with the last
    ringers leaving the lodge this morning after quite a different
    season. Only 10,800 migrants were ringed this year as opposed to the
    c.17,000 that were ringed last year, the main reason being poor
    weather conditions of more mistless nights than nights with mist.
    Totals are still being finalised but the predominance of Marsh
    Warbler was very noticeable with fewer Hippolais warblers than most
    years - though Olive-tree was quite well represented - and also
    fewer Basra Reed Warblers, Iranias and River Warblers. No
    foreign-ringed bird was caught either making it the second year in a
    row that we have not caught one with a ring already - something that
    had become expected every year. <br>
    <br>
    Species of most interest ringing-wise was the Icterine Warbler
    ringed at night on the 23rd November - otherwise probably the most
    significant record of the season was not a ringing record but an
    incredible movement of over 25,500 Amur Falcons over the lodge in a
    2-hour period on the 26th November. It was an astounding sight and
    probably the largest movement of Amur Falcons recorded to date in
    Kenya. We also had a Eurasian Sparrowhawk hanging around the lodge -
    seen at least twice on different days (presumed the same bird) and a
    good number of Booted Eagles moving through heading south.<br>

    <br>
    back here in Watamu - on 1st and 2nd December there were still good
    numbers of Blue-cheeked Bee-eaters going over heading south as well
    as a few flocks of Eurasian Bee-eater and White-throated Bee-eater.

    Yesterday evening I watched at least 3,000 Brown Noddies flying off
    Whale Island at dusk - I watched until it was almost dark but didn't
    see them settling on the island to roost - unless they went to roost
    after dark... <br>
