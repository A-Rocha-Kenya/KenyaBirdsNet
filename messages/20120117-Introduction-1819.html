Dear Birders,
I am new to the group though I have had an interest in birding which I was doing on an ad hoc basis. I travel to all sorts of far off places being a consultant in rural infrastructure development.I would like to be more systematic and hence would like advice on:
-Which is a good book or books on birds in the region (I travel all over the greater Eastern Africa region)
-Which would be a good camera that I can easily use to take pictures of some the exotic birds I come across
-Which would be a good binoculars for birding
-any other advice for a novice?

Cheers All
Kingori
