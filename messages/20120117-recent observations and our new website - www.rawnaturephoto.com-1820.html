Hi All,<br><br>Yesterday (16th Jan), an African Moustached Warbler was singing well at Rekero Camp. This is my first record for the Talek River, with all previous records records from Keekorok and Kichwa Tembo.<br><br>Since around Christmas, we&#39;ve been witness to a large evening commute of Yellow Wagtails and hirundines, mostly Barn Swallows, flying west over camp. Flocks of wagtails average between 30-100 birds and there have been as many as 100 of these flocks going over each night, all in close proximity to each other. A conservative estimate would be 5000 Yellow Wagtails and 10-15,000 hirundines.They head towards a roost the Talek-Mara confluence somewhere and is seriously impressive most evenings. We didn&#39;t experience anything like it last year. <br>
<br>I&#39;d like to welcome visitors to our new website at <a href="http://www.rawnaturephoto.com">www.rawnaturephoto.com</a> - an online image library and blog that Vicki has built over the past month. Within it are 375 African bird species, plus lots of mammals and reptiles etc, and we&#39;ll continue to populate it with more images as we collate them. It is especially ideal for anyone looking for stock images for publishing, marketing and promotional material of East African wildlife and eco-tourism and our commercial rates are highly competitive. <br>
<br>Best wishes from the Mara,<br><br>Adam<br>Naibor Camp, Masai Mara<br><br> <br>
