Hi All,<br><br>Celebrating my birthday with an afternoon drive close to Naibor, it couldn&#39;t have been much better.<br><br>Starting off with a subadult male Montagu&#39;s Harrier which glided alongside the vehicle allowing some lovely images to be taken, followed by my first Eurasian Marsh Harrier, a female, that was, strangely enough, my first in the Mara. Around the corner, we found a Dark Chanting Goshawk that was my first in the Naibor area and towards Irish Bridge we discovered a busy Jackson&#39;s Widowbird lekking area with numerous males (up to 7) jumping high with tails fanned and up to 20 females buzzing around the display area. Down at Irish Bridge, we found Fan-tailed, Yellow-mantled and White-winged Widows but best of all a Long-tailed Cormorant flew over, another first for my Mara list. Heading back towards Rekero Camp, we spotted a pair of African Hawk Eagle perched nearby and in an adjacent tree a Martial Eagle landed, only to be mobbed by a male Little Sparrowhawk.<br>
<br>All in all, a good few hours spent.<br><br>Best to all,<br><br>Adam <br>
