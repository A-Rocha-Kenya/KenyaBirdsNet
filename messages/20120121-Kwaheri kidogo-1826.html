<p class="MsoNormal">Dear All,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">After 2 fabulous years in the Mara, Vicki and I will be
leaving Naibor on 4<sup>th</sup> February for pastures new.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We plan to enjoy some hardcore recces around northern Tanzania for 3 weeks followed by a bird-driven month-long
trip around Uganda,
where we aim to offer future birding and photographic tours from June 2012
onwards. We expect things to be slow for the first few years and will
supplement such trips with relief management at various camps in Kenya,
and we are open to any other interesting offers that come our way. Similarly, any experienced pro-bird
guides looking for a second man/ driver, I’d be delighted to hear from you
regarding Kenya, TZ and/or Uganda.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Regarding Uganda,
I’m very keen to hear from birders who have visited the country for info regarding
the best local guides to use. Having read up on the country, I think I’ve got a
reasonable feel for what to see where but knowing the local guides who’ll know
exact locations within reserves etc will make a huge difference to us. I’ve
heard of a guide called Fred (no last name yet, pole) at Bwindi who is apparently very
good (especially for African Green Broadbill) but have no means of reaching him. We’ll be skipping the northern area,
including Kidepo, on this trip and focus on the western forests, Murchison, QE
NP and Lake Mburo areas. I can&#39;t wait to get stuck into those forests.....!!!<br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In the meantime, Vicki and I have just uploaded details to
our website, <a href="http://www.rawnaturephoto.com">www.rawnaturephoto.com</a>, of a spectacular 18-night Antarctica cruise,
including stops in the Falklands and South Georgia,
which we’ll be hosting in January 2013, should anyone be interested.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It’s been a pleasure being part of the Kenya Birding community
so far and I hope to continue providing news and reports as we progress.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">With warmest regards,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
