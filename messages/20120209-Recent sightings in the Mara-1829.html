<p class="MsoNormal">Dear All,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Vicki and I returned to Naibor last night after a 3-day
safari in the Mara. Among the best birds of the trip were;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Rufous-bellied Heron – at least 5 seen at Musiara Marsh, 6/2</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Open-billed Stork – 3 juveniles at Musiara Marsh on the
evening of 5/2, obviously locally raised. Around 10 adults also seen here</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Black Stork – at least 3 birds in and around Musiara,
possibly 4, 6/2 and 7/2 </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">White Stork – singles at Musiara Marsh on 6/2 and another
near Rhino Ridge on 7/2</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Ovambo Sparrowhawk – a single whizzed by the Bateleur Camp
mess as we arrived on 7/2</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Harlequin Quail – males seen at Double Crossing (Mara), and
another at Musiara both on 5/2. A different bird seen near Musiara Gate on 7/2.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Caspian Plover – a very obliging flock of 33 seen just
outside Talek village on 7/2, with another high-flying flock of 18, plus a
single, at Naboisho Conservancy on the same evening. Another flock of 16 seen
there the following day. Several males were in FBP and looked absolutely
amazing. I’ll be posting images on <a href="http://surfbirds.com">surfbirds.com</a> on the World Birding gallery of
these stunners.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Olive Pigeon – a very showy bird at Governors’ Camp on 6/2</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Schalow’s Turaco – a single bathing at the birdbath at
Governors’ Camp, 6/2</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Ross’s Turaco – at least two, possibly three birds coming to
the birdbath at Governors’ Camp 6/2. There cannot be a better place to watch and
enjoy these beautiful birds. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">White-tailed Lark – no birds heard singing on the plains but
a single was seen close to Naibor on 8/2</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Pied Wheatear - around 10 seen in Naboisho Conservancy on 7/2</p><p class="MsoNormal">Buff-bellied Penduline Tit – a single at Naboisho Camp on
8/2</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Black-headed Gonolek – 2 birds calling at Bateleur Camp/
Kichwa Tembo on 7/2, with one bird seen</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Black-necked Weaver – my first confirmed sighting in the
Mara of what is probably a fairly common bird here, a fine male singing at
Governors’ Camp, 7/2</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Straw-tailed Whydah – a fine male with two females on the
edge of Talek village on the afternoon of 7/2. I’ve never seen them so close to
the reserve before.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal">We depart the Mara today for Nairobi where we&#39;ll spend 2 nights before heading down to TZ for a 3-week safari!</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Best to all,</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal">Adam</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>
