Dear All Birders,<BR>
Am currently leading a bird tour and we have just been to Lake Baringo where we managed to see tha STAR SPOTTED NIGHTJAR. If any of you may have missed this last year when this bird was seen again at Baringo, I would kindly request you make your way to Baringo to see it!!! Otherwise by end of March this bird may have to migrate again. Although this bird is said to be locally and common in Northern Kenya it is the second or third time this bird has been seen down to lake baringo. Again to those who saw it last year the bird is still roosting at the same area it was!!! Local giudes there like Wilson 0723528172 or Francis 0723163267 would help to track it.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Regards,<BR>
Joseph<BR>
