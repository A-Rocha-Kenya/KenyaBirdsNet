<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dear Birders,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Bird walk on Sat March 17th to Central Quarry, 
Lafarge property, Bamburi.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Among the many water birds&nbsp;seen were a number 
of Black Herons.&nbsp; This bird used to be here on a regualr basis but has been 
absent for a long time.&nbsp; It now seems to be back!&nbsp; We saw at least 5, 
only one doing its 'umbrella' fishing.&nbsp; African Darter has also adopted 
this as a breeding site.&nbsp; Only 2 adults on Sat. but in Dec, nests with 
juveniles.&nbsp; Other birds of interest: Palm Nut Vulture, Great Sparrowhawk, 
Common Squacco Heron, Purple Heron and a flock of Open Billed Storks (a new 
arrival at this site) coming in at sunset to roost.&nbsp; As someone recently 
commented on Birdsnet 'it is sometimes more interesting to speculate on what one 
doesn't see'!&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulars: Purple Swamphen, Alan's Gallinule, White 
Faced Tree Ducks, Water Thicknees seem to have moved out.&nbsp; Presumably to 
better pastures or maybe the odd crocodile in the lake terrorised them!

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The old bird hide is now renovated which is useful 
but there&nbsp;still needs some thinning of the reeds to give a better view of 
the lake.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Eurasian Golden Orioles are now passing through 
Tudor and the Palm Nut Vulture is still flying around, running the gauntlet of 
the Indian House Crows most mornings.&nbsp; Sadly the resident African Wood Owls 
have disappeared!</FONT></DIV>
