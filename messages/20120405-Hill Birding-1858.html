Dear Birders,

I spent last two weeks on a research Project on Montane and Taita White-eyes in Nagangao Forest, Taita Hills, Mount Kasigau in taita Chyulu Hills, and the Kikuyu escarpment in Kireita Forest. 

We had a lot of Red-caped Robin Chats both observed in the Field and captured in the mist nets on Mount Kasigau. We captured a total of eight Red-caped R. Chats of which 4( 50%) were immature and 2 adult Recaptures. Other birds captured were the White-stared Robins both immature and adult, Cabani's Greenbuls, Taita White-eyes( so many), Green-backed Twinspot, crowned Eagle and olive sunbirds among others. Does the Stripe-cheeked Greenbul exist on Mount Kasigau? 

In Nagangoa Forest( the easiest fragment to access by birders) I observed a pair of Taita Apalis( With bothmtal and Colour rings-Metal/blue and Red/red), Srped Cheeked Greenbuls, Cabani's Greenbul, Taita white-eye, Hartloub's Turacco and Taita Thrush.

I Chylu Hills we captured Black caps, Tree pipits, White-cheeked bulbuls, Dark-caped Yellow warbler, Bronze Sunbirds, Ruppel's robin chats, Eastern Double Colored Sunbirds,Montane white-eyes, brown woodland warbler, Wilow warblers, Gre-backed Camaroptera, african Fire-finch,Spot-flanked Barbet, White-eared Barbet( only seen), white-stared Robin, Olive sunbird, Harloub's Turaco, Tropical Boubou, among Others.

On the Kikuyu Escarpment, great birding about one and half hours drive from Nairobi, very bad road from Kimende but accessible.We capture White-tared Robin, Ruppel's Robin chat, Evergreen Forest Warbler, White-browed Crombec, Abyssinian Hill Barbler, Yellow-whiskered greenbul, Mountain Greenbul, Cabanis' greenbuls, Olive sunbird, Black-collared Apalis, Yellow-belied Waxbil and many others observed. Some of the Recaptured Yellow-whiskered greenbuls and Ruppel's Robin Chats could at least ten years old, will confirm soon.

Wish you a great birding Easter holoday.

Titus Imboma
