On a brief excursion (7th April) to the Lumo Conservancy bordering Tsavo
 West we encountered lots of perched Lesser Kestrels (30+) with fewer 
Amur falcons (9) mixed in with them. We also observed a single Eurasian 
Hobby over the lodge at Lion&#39;s Bluff.<br>
<br>During the rainy first week of April  large numbers of European 
Rollers were on the move and Barn Swallows were everywhere in the Taita 
lowlands (Mwatate, Msau, Bura, Godoma, Lualenyi) . Small flocks of 
Eurasian Bee-eaters were also seen.<br>
<br>Also we observed a flock of 25 Open-billed Storks at Voi Safari 
Lodge on April 6th,  does this species undertake local or regional 
migrations? We&#39;ve never seen them in such numbers at the Lodge before.<br><br>Pete Steward &amp; Radhika Timbadia<div><div><br></div>
