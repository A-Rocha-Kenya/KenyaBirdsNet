Hello Birders'

Despite the heavy rainfalls going on around Nairobi i managed to visit Karura forest yesterday for a walk.

Karura has life for so many church groups having their walk, other people jogging,bicycle rides and of course a perfect place for see forest birds.We must not forget to thank (AFEW) African fund for endangered wildlife for constructing stairs to caves and a path bridge along Karura river.

Broad-billed Roller seated on croton tree,Brown-troated Alethe at under growth,Cabanis's Greenbul and klaas's cuckoo male feeding young one of which i was shocked coz all i know is that klaas's cuckoo are nest parasite on sunbirds nest. My worry is do they take care of the young ones after the sunbirds  realises that they are growing at an amazing rate.

George.
