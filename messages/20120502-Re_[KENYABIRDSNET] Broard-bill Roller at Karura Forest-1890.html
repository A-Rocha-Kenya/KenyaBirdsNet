Dear George,
I think you will find that the male was courtship-feeding a female
prior to mating, rather than any relationship with a juvenile,
Best for now

Hello Birders'

Despite the heavy rainfalls going on around Nairobi i managed to visit
Karura forest yesterday for a walk.

Karura has life for so many church groups having their walk, other people
jogging,bicycle rides and of course a perfect place for see forest birds.We
must not forget to thank (AFEW) African fund for endangered wildlife for
constructing stairs to caves and a path bridge along Karura river.

Broad-billed Roller seated on croton tree,Brown-troated Alethe at under
growth,Cabanis's Greenbul and klaas's cuckoo male feeding young one of which
i was shocked coz all i know is that klaas's cuckoo are nest parasite on
sunbirds nest. My worry is do they take care of the young ones after the
sunbirds  realises that they are growing at an amazing rate.

George.
