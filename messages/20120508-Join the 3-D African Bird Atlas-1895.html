<br>Hi everyone
<br>
<br>We are pleased to announce the launch of a brand new project at
<br><a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.g-bird.org">www.g-bird.org</a> which should hopefully shed new light on Africa's bird
<br>movements, distributions and abundances across the continent and associated
<br>islands. The project is aimed at all bird-watchers and allows a new level of
<br>3-D feedback and display. The system includes all 2,500+ species from the
<br>region and displays all your sightings recorded per trip in 3-D, flagging
<br>any Out-of-range sighting in Red to immediately alert a potential mis-id.
<br>g-Bird also displays recognised Distribution maps for each species as well
<br>as Grid analysed Reporting Rate Percentages per species where data has been
<br>collected.
<br>
<br>
<br>The aim of the project is to
<br>a) provide a single consistent protocol that will be workable throughout
<br>Africa. This allows grid-analysed results to be displayed seamlessly across
<br>the continent for any resolution (such as Quarter Degree Square, 5min x
<br>5min, 5km x 5km etc)(or alternatively against Vegetation, Rainfall or Relief
<br>datasets).
<br>
<br>b) collect data at GPS accuracy with exact Time which will allow any type of
<br>analysis for specific project requirements from different organisations
<br>
<br>c) integrate smart-phone technology to record in-the-field data
<br>
<br>d) provide a built-in level of data vetting on the phone which immediately
<br>flags the birder to a possible mis-id. And most importantly to do this while
<br>the birder is still in the field and has the chance to re-assess the id of
<br>the the bird while it is still present
<br>
<br>e) provide a new level of 3-D feedback of different types for participants
<br>
<br>f) create personalised lists &amp; export sightings to CSV or Excel format for
<br>use elsewhere
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Adding your sightings to view in 3-D is done through the g-Bird Mobile
<br>smartphone app which is available for free download from the iStore (if you
<br>have an iPhone). Other platforms such as Android, Windows and Blackberry
<br>will be available in the near future. Alternatively if you already have GPS
<br>captured sightings (for example from Cybertracker software) and would like
<br>to see them in 3-D, you can email them through to us and we will add them in
<br>from our side.
<br>
<br>
<br>The smartphone apps allow quick and easy recording of ones sightings,
<br>displaying them on GoogleMaps on the phone and flagging any sighting that
<br>falls outside of its recognised distribution range to allow one the chance
<br>to re-assess its id. It also keeps current Trip list totals and totals per
<br>species.
<br>
<br>
<br>Registering on <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.g-Bird.org">www.g-Bird.org</a>&nbsp; is free or one can also open the system as a
<br>Test user by pressing the "Log in as Test User" link which will allow you to
<br>use the system with test data. There is a once-off installation of the
<br>GoogleEarth Browser plugin if you have not already previously installed it.
<br>Species names are available in 9 languages and follow the IOC (v 2.10)
<br>naming convention by default, though this can be reset to follow the
<br>Clements or Sibley-Monroe lists if needed
<br>
<br>
<br>Screenshots of the system are available at <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.g-bird.org/screenshots">www.g-bird.org/screenshots</a>

<br>
<br>We hope this proves to be a valuable tool for all birders
