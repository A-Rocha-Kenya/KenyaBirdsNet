Hi all. Please see email below requesting ideas for where weavers may be breeding. If you have any suggestions of beautiful spots full of weavers please write direct to Lucy (cc'd on this email).

Subject: Weaver birds - BBC filming

Good afternoon,

 

My name is Lucy Wells and I'm a Researcher for the BBC Natural History
Unit. We were meant to be filming weaver birds at Lake Baringo next week
for a new series. However, I have just heard that there aren't many
weaver birds this year and so we are not sure if we want to film there
or not.

 

Do you have any other recommendations to where we can film weaver birds
in Kenya? It needs to be a beautiful location with lots of weaver birds
(preferably village weaver birds). We really liked the fact that the
weaver birds at Lake Baringo built nests over the water - do you know
anywhere else where this happens?

 

We need some options urgently so if you could let me know as soon as
possible it would be much appreciated.

 

 

Many thanks,

Lucy
