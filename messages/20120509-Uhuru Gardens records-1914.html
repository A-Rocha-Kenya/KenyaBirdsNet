Greetings Birders

Nature Kenya's Wednesday Morning Birdwalk spent an exciting morning at Uhuru
Gardens National Monument on May 9.

The highlight was a rare plant, Brachystelma lineare, whose flowers smell of
cow dung and are pollinated by flies.

Birds seen or heard were over 63 species, including a seasonal Dwarf Bittern
(missed by me, but caught on camera by Peter Usher), a Sedge Warbler, and
several species not normally recorded on Wednesday birdwalks, including
African Moustached Warbler (now Moustached Grass Warbler), Spotted Morning
Thrush (now Spotted Palm Thrush) and Yellow-bellied Eremomela.

On the way home, a flock of Great White Pelicans was circling over the
traffic jams! 

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
