On the 30th April, Mike Davidson, Fleur Ng’Weno, Jennifer Oduori, Karen
Plube and myself met at the Main Entrance to Nairobi National Park at
6.30am.

We first looked at KWS Mess Garden, and whilst a selection of birds were
present, there was nothing note-worthy, nor was there at Ivory Burning Site.
We took the back road to Hyena Dam, but found our way blocking by flooding,
so retraced back to the main road. We sat by the swamp whilst having our
first morning coffee break, and whilst there were entertained by a male
payesii (African) Little Bittern who was hunting in the close reeds,
wing-flashing to startle prey. Also there were the usual African Water Rails
feeding openly with three Swamphens and an adult and immature Lesser
Moorhens. An African Jacana was also in the shallows with a pair of
White-faced Whistling-Ducks, six Wood Sandpipers flew over and a Sedge
Warbler flitted around in the reeds.
We left for Nagalomon Dam finding a lone Lesser Grey Shrike, and amongst the
moving Barn Swallows, one each of House and Sand Martins.
There were three Spotted Thicknees on the Nagalomon Drift.
We arrived at the dam where there were ten or more Black-crowned
Night-Herons and a Purple Heron. Keeping to the north of the Park because of
many roads being impassable, we had a look at the Langata Dam failing to
find a desired Dwarf Bittern, and only rewarded by a Little Grebe and a
Nairobi Pipit.
On the return to the gate we found an Eurasian Cuckoo and the first
Madagascar Bee-eater of the season.

Mammals were fairly quiet, but we had a couple of lionesses at Nagalomon
Dam.

We were through the gate by 3.00pm.

Best to all,
Brian
