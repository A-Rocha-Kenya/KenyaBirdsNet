Having had a trying time battling Nairobi traffic, Mike Davidson and myself
decided to have a couple of hours in the evening in the Park.

It was overcast and rained as towards the end of our stay. At Hyena Dam
there was little to entertain us, but the feeder stream to the Hyena run-off
had a very late Common Snipe. We watched the pair of Saddle-billed Storks
mating in the top of an acacia along the Mokoyeti, and finished with a
posing lion resting on the top of marker 5b!

Best to all,
Brian
