Dear All,

On 7th May, Mike Davidson, Jennifer Oduori, Karen Plumbe and myself met at
the Main Entrance to Nairobi National Park at 6.30am. Fleur Ng’Weno joined
us for the afternoon.

There had been showers overnight, but the morning was dry though overcast,
and remained dry for the time we were there. The recent rainstorms had made
some areas impassable and our access was restricted.

We started at KWS Mess Garden, but there was nothing of excitement here,
there were three Spotted Thicknees at the Nagalomon Drift, and a dozen
Black-crowned Night-Herons in the trees at the dam. We went as far as the
back of Hyena Dam on the back road, but flooding prevented us getting to the
dam from this direction. There was a late Willow Warbler here, but nothing
else of note. We went to Hyena Dam the along the main road, and had a coffee
whilst parked by the swamp. Here we were rewarded by  pair of African Water
Rails, three very attractive Swamphens and an African Crake in the middle of
the dam, alongside thick cover. Also here were a Yellow-billed Egret, whilst
the Saddle-billed Stork pair were on their nest by the Mokoyeti. We made it
through to Eland Hollow, where there were a Little Grebe, a pair of
Yellow-billed Duck, a Red-billed Teal and a Hippo. Karen Primary School Dam
was cleared of reeds and produced nothing.
In the grasslands we found three Jacobin Cuckoos, and a black Levaillant’s
Cuckoo as well as several Diederic Cuckoos, also there were an immature and
adult Blac-chested Snake-Eagle (maybe three), a couple of Rosy-breasted
Lonclaws, and the only Barn Swallow of the day.
We visited the Hippo Pools and witnessed the damage caused by the recent
floods, trees have been scoured from the rivers edge, and dumped
unceremoniously near the car-park. The river had been over the top of the
bridge, and there was a lot of debris on and attached under it. The
riverside track was still under water although the level had dropped
dramatically since the torrent rent its havoc. There were no unusual birds
recorded, although Violet Wood-Hoopoes were heard, as were Red-faced
Cisticolas. On the return via Kingfisher Picnic Site, Long-billed Pipits
were met with several times and we were through the gate by 4.00pm.

Interesting mammals were two Chandler’s Reedbucks in their usual haunt, an
Oribi along the upper Mokoyeti, and a couple of White Rhinos. Plains game
numbers were greatly reduced, and there has been an exodus from the Park of
Zebra and Eland. Three Lions were met with, all males. One near the
“Beacon”, and two walking along the road near the Main Entrance in the
evening.

Best to all,
Brian
