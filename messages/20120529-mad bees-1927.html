There were quite a few juvs / imms, many in various stages of wing moult,&nbsp;most looking quite 'tatty' with outer primaries 6,7,8, in active moult and no
 long central tail feathers. These features all indicate REGULAR post breeding movement / migration but</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>WHERE HAVE THEY COME FROM ?</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>a similar roost was located north of Pangani by Paul Oliver a week ago and these may well have been from our small (even tiny) breeding population in&nbsp;the lower reaches of the Pangani River catchment, extending into SE Kenya.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>last year there were reports of Mad Bees moving through Malawi and Zambia more or less at the time the Bagamoyo roost was vacated.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>this year we have had reports of Mad Bees moving through our central Rift but not at all sure in what direction.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>ANY records of movements through Malawi and Zambia recently ?? and in the next few weeks would be VERY MUCH appreciated.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>What about coastal Kenya, any mangrove roost sites for these birds
 ?</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>and for everyone on the coast of Tanzania&nbsp; PLEASE log all obs of these birds.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>many thanks</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Neil</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Neil and Liz Baker, Tanzania Bird Atlas, P.O.
