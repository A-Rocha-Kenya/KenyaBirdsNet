Dear Birders
Birding at the Haller Park or the Bamburi Nature Trail is rewarding birders.
On Thursday morning I visited the Bambururi Nature Trail with on a field training course with Polllman's Driver Guides.The site is blessed with a variety of both terrestrial and silent waterbirds including secretive larger and smaller herons. On the first pond, left of the main entrance we saw a malachite Kingfisher, Pied Kingfisher, a beautiful Mangrove Kingfisher and Nice female Giant Kingfisher. In the trees above there was a pair of Woolly-necked Stork Nesting(probably eggs on the nest since we could not see young). On same pond was a female Striated Heron. On the next bond was a pair of Black-crowned night Heron and the Grey Heron. Moving we saw the bird of the day, the Madagascar  Squacco or Pond Heron. Just a single bird, next to three Elands. When one eland stood up to move the squacco followe it and was seen remove some ecto parasites. Next to the squacco were two adult Water Thick-knee and a young one well camouflaged under a tree.These are
 just but a few birds spotted.

Wish a nice birding week.
