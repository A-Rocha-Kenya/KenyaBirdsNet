Dear Birders,

Greeting and hopeful this finds you well.

Today (25th June 2012) while on FONA Nature (Tree) walk we spotted a Purple-crested Turaco being fought by 2 Hartlaub's Turaco down at the picnic site by the Kirichwa Kubwa River. The Turaco gave an ample time hooping from tree to tree and making a very deep vocal call.

Managed to voice record its deepened call with my phone...unfortunately tried the do a digi-scoping snap (with the Binocular) but in vain.

Also spotted a pair Silvery-cheeked Hornbill and a pair African Black (River) Duck)too.

Another interesting spotting.....3 caged African Grey Parrot on the residential apartment....the cage is well place at the corner of the balcony overlooking the Arboretum...the parrots can occasionally be heard....not sure what steps would be taken on the same. I believe the parrots are illegally caged.

Great birding
Joshua
