<BR>
Nature Kenya's Wednesday Morning Birdwalk visited Manguo Ponds in Limuru off the Nairobi-Nakuru road on 27 June. <BR>
<BR>
This remarkable seasonal wetlands is now full of water and birds, after several years of apparently drying out slowly. We met two members of the local conservation group, who said the wetland had been full since some time in April.<BR>
<BR>
Breeding bird highlights include: <BR>
White-backed Ducks with several small ducklings, already able to dive<BR>
Maccoa Duck male with large all-dark immature<BR>
Red-knobbed Coots with five tiny chicks, and dozens of other coots on nests<BR>
Grey Crowned Crane apparently sitting on nest<BR>
Whiskered Terns feeding chicks and building nests<BR>
<BR>
There were many other waterbirds, and the birdwalk volunteers are drawing up the full list.<BR>
<BR>
Wishing you good birding, Fleur<BR>
