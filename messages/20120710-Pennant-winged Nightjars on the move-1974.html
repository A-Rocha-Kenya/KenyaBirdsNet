Dear All,<br><br>Vicki and I are currently stationed at Sala&#39;s Camp on the Kenya side of the Mara-Serengeti border and on our second evening here (8th July), we were witness to two male Pennant-winged Nightjar floating over the camp together around 7.15pm, just before the last light was lost. <br>
<br>Last night, we went out of camp to see if they would come by again... and they did, around 7.05pm, two birds coming from different locations but joining up over Sala&#39;s before seemingly heading south over the northern Serengeti. I managed to grab a few low-light images including the attached.   <br>
<br>This was a long-awaited lifer for me - finally &quot;gripping it back&quot; from Vicki who had a male PWNJ floating over her head outside our tent in Katavi 3 years ago while I was in the kitchen.<br><br>Also, a pair of Western Banded Snake Eagle calling and soaring over camp yesterday morning, looking very much at home here. <br>
<br>Cheers for now,<br>Adam<br><br>
