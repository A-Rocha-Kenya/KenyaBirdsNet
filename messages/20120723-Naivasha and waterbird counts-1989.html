 Hi all, 
The bi-annual waterbird counts were conducted at Lake Naivasha yesterday.  The large group camped at the KWS campsite at Hippo Point and a brief evening birding stint from the campsite revealed the very high lake levels and subsequent boon for waterbirds.  In the papyrus/hyacinth dotted wetlands that have come into existence with the rains were an astounding density of birds.  The highlight for me was 10 African jacanas in a single binocular field. Fleur saw a little bittern.  There were many, many herons, egrets, spoonbills, plovers, etc.  Also a pair of Gabar goshawks.

On Sunday our team surveyed the shore along Crescent Island by boat.  The highlight was finding 5 nests of African darter.  One nest had two well-developed chicks begging the adult for food.  Our group also recorded:
purple heron
squacco heron
Madagascar pond heron (1)
yellow-billed stork
glossy and hadada ibis
spoonbill
great egret
little  egret
cattle egret
both spp of cormorant
10+ darters
blacksmith, spur-winged and long-toed plovers
4 common greenshank
giant, malachite and pied kingfishers
African jacanas with young
