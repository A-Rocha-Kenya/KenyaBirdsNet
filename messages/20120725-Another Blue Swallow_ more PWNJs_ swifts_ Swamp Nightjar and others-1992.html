<div>Hi All,</div><div> </div><div>On the afternoon of 23rd July, I was trying to photograph some Horus Swifts that were buzzing through camp when I noticed another Blue Swallow in the river below Sala&#39;s Camp. My camera settings were way off for the gloomy river bed but hopefully you can just about make it out from the attached image. Because the camp has been so busy, I&#39;ve been unable to return to Roan Hill since my frist sighting but if there are any birders around the southern Mara at the moment, I&#39;d recommend a look. </div>
<div> </div><div>Swifts have been pouring over camp intermittently, with big flocks of Nyanza and Mottled Swifts seemingly following the gnu herds. With these have been a few Black Swift and yesterday an Alpine Swift, both swifts being new for my Mara list.</div>
<div> </div><div>On the evening of 23rd three male Pennant-winged Nightjar headed SE together; this follows on from 3 males the previous evening (also together) so I have to question if these could have been the same birds. Both sighting of three males were unusual in the height they were flying at, probably over 100 feet, whereas all other sightings have been around 50 feet. Last night (24th), a single male was seen.</div>
<div> </div><div>While standing at my usual spot at the entrance to camp, I have been &quot;visited&quot; by a small nightjar for much of the past week but it has been flying low and fast and only 1 poor image taken which is not hugely helpful for ID. Last night, it showed very well though and proved to be a Swamp Nightjar, a bird that has been calling with regularity around 6am most days, but it was good to actually see it at last.</div>
<div> </div><div>The Ovambo Sparrowhawk made another appearance on the afternoon of 23rd - mobbed like crazy by the local hirundines. </div><div> </div><div>But possibly my biggest surprise this week was a Yellow-whiskered Greenbul heard calling in camp on the morning of 22nd July but despite searching and using playback, the bird could not be located.</div>
<div> </div><div>All this along the beautiful Sand River.</div><div> </div><div>Cheers for now,</div><div>Adam </div><div> </div><div> </div>
