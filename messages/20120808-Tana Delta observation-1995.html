Hi all yes i have been silent for the last two month trying to figure out this new site i am Garsen. the community seeing people walking with binos is like a movie.
the observation that i have had from last month and early this month which has rise concern is hundred of dove feeding on the marrum road from Mnazini on your way to Tana primate reserve.
African Mourning dove
Ring neck dove
Namaqua dove
black face sand grouse 
the species of birds are mainly located at between this two villages and seems to be use the area as transist route.
what can be done is to inform drivers driving there to lower the speed as most time people are speed driving which can kill the feeding doves.
