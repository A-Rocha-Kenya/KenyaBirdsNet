Dear Birders,<BR>
Am on a short birding safari and wanted to share some exciting views, on 6th Aug I was at Lake naivasha where I took boat ride only to discover 1 African Skimmer roosted with White Winged terns, if anybody is interested to see them I understand from my boat man that they were seen there about 3 days ago that was 3rd Aug and were 2 of them. In Manguo Pond Limuru there wer lot of African Black duck as well few of Maccoa Ducks thanks to the rains coming back and filling -in the pond with alot of water and interesting to see was&nbsp; one Mad.Pond heron in the dry reeds as well lake Nakuru still has a madagascar Pond heron on the road that was rocky and now closed by flooding in the tree near road and where it is submerged!! I last sited this bird in lake Nakuru on June 17th when again I was on a birding safari<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
This Morning at Samburu game reserve I had 2 Red necked falcon eating an African morning Dove and later tried to hunt green wood hoopes but they wer not successful. I did migrate to Mount kenya at castle forest Lodge and shortly after arrival about an 1hour later and 15 minutes to 1900hrs&nbsp; 4 African Green Ibis came calling and flew by to the inner top forest and soon that happen or they disappeared 2 hadada ibis also can calling and roosted on top of the dinning room. The sounds of both species are totally different but some how close to each other.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Wishing you all happy birding!!<BR>
regards, Joseph<BR>
