Greetings birders

The level of Lake Naivasha is still rising, and has reached the edge of the
Acacia woodland at the KWS Hippo Camp causeway. Nature Kenya¹s Sunday
Birdwatch spend a wonderful sunny day there on August 19, watching
waterbirds fly and fish among the acacias! The large floating island on
which we had counted so many egrets on the July waterbird count had
completely disappeared; boats were moored at the KWS jetty; and we had clear
views over water from the end of the jetty to Crescent and Yatch Club
islands. Highlights included:

A group of Pink-backed Pelicans fishing cooperatively
An African Fish Eagle with two handsome immatures
Four Black-tailed Godwits flying over
Several Black Cuckoos, mostly the type with reddish throats and barred
bellies. They sang their typical call, and another song that sounded
extremely similar to the Green Wood-Hoopoe (that we also saw and heard).

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
