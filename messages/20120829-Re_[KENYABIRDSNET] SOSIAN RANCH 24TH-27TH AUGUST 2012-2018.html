  Nigel and Julia Hunter and myself had the opportunity&nbsp; to have four days 
  at<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; Sosian Ranch on Western Laikipia. Apart from a few 
  rainy&nbsp; spells Nigel and<BR>&gt; I were birding most of the daylight 
  hours, and the mornings&nbsp; were always<BR>&gt; sparkling and fresh. During 
  the two full days we managed to record&nbsp; just<BR>&gt; over<BR>&gt; 200 
  species which is not bad when there were only six palearctics&nbsp; 
  included<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; in the total. In addition there were some remarkably 
  common species&nbsp; that<BR>&gt; went unrecorded.<BR>&gt; Whilst driving 
  about nine kilometers north of&nbsp; Rumuruti, I asked Nigel to<BR>&gt; stop 
  the car as I thought I could hear Grey-backed&nbsp; Fiscal singing, and 
  I<BR>&gt; had<BR>&gt; never heard of one east of the Rift before. Sure&nbsp; 
  enough there was a<BR>&gt; Grey-backed Fiscal, and we had two more singles 
  near eleven&nbsp; kilometers<BR>&gt; north. On<BR>&gt; the return we were 
  keeping an eye (and ear) open for them&nbsp; as we bumped<BR>&gt; along the 
  road back to Rumuruti. We saw seven birds from nine&nbsp; kilometers<BR>&gt; 
  out,<BR>&gt; with the last pair literally on the outskirts of the town.&nbsp; 
  Having been home<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; I have researched the known distribution for 
  the species and&nbsp; found the<BR>&gt; following… Britton lists them in the 
  Rift at Baringo, Nakuru to&nbsp; Naivasha<BR>&gt; with<BR>&gt; the farthest 
  eastern being Lake Solai. Stevenson et al. give no&nbsp; eastern<BR>&gt; 
  records, Lewis and Pomeroy’s “A Bird Atlas of Kenya,” did not list<BR>&gt; 
  Grey-back<BR>&gt; Fiscal as ever having occurred east of the Rift, but 
  Zimmermann and&nbsp; Turner<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; give the distribution much as the 
  others but adding “occasionally east&nbsp; to<BR>&gt; the Laikipia 
  Plateau.”&nbsp; Our findings indicate that the bird is now a&nbsp; 
  common<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; resident between Rumuruti and eleven kilometers to the 
  north at&nbsp; least.<BR>&gt; Other interesting findings were all from Sosian. 
  We&nbsp; had an adult Dark<BR>&gt; Chanting Goshawk, whilst Eastern Chanting 
  is a common&nbsp; species there. Again<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; there is little 
  recorded in the literature of this&nbsp; species occurring east<BR>&gt; 
  of<BR>&gt; the Rift. Britton and Lewis &amp; Pomeroy could not&nbsp; provide 
  one instance of the<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; species appearing east of the Rift, and 
  Zimmermann&nbsp; &amp; Turner also could not<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; cite a record. 
  The bird at Sosian until any&nbsp; further evidence comes to<BR>&gt; 
  light,<BR>&gt; probably represents a wanderer, rather than&nbsp; any obvious 
  attempt to extend<BR>&gt; the range eastwards. We had a lone Somali Tit,&nbsp; 
  but later in the morning<BR>&gt; four kilometers away we ran across another. 
  Whether&nbsp; this was the same<BR>&gt; individual that was at great odds 
  relocated in another area,&nbsp; or there were<BR>&gt; two<BR>&gt; birds 
  present cannot be determined. However this was the&nbsp; first time 
  the<BR>&gt; species<BR>&gt; had been seen on Sosian, and at 5,800 feet 
  is&nbsp; remarkably high for the<BR>&gt; species. Britton, Lewis &amp; Pomeroy 
  and Zimmermann&nbsp; &amp; Turner all give the<BR>&gt; distribution as north 
  of Laikipia, extending to&nbsp; Baringo in the Rift, and in<BR>&gt; 
  the<BR>&gt; semi-arid Somali biome south to Isiolo then&nbsp; through the 
  Tsavos. There<BR>&gt; appears<BR>&gt; to be no record from the Laikipia 
  Plateau.&nbsp; There was a Black-capped Social<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; Weaver hanging 
  around the lodge, as much&nbsp; associating with Chestnut 
  Sparrows<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; as Grey-capped Social Weavers. None of&nbsp; Britton, 
  Lewis &amp; Pomeroy or<BR>&gt; Zimmermann &amp; Turner can give any 
  instance&nbsp; where the species has wandered<BR>&gt; outside<BR>&gt; of its 
  range in Kenya. The closest area&nbsp; of occurrence to the north that 
  is<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; given is Barsaloi, and the closest to the&nbsp; east is 
  Samburu. Again this would<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; appear to be the first documented 
  record of&nbsp; the species occurring on the<BR>&gt; Laikipia Plateau.<BR>&gt; 
  Other observations were some ten sightings of&nbsp; Buttonquails, even 
  though<BR>&gt; the grass is long and lush no Harlequin Quails were&nbsp; seen 
  or heard.<BR>&gt; There was a single lost Pied Avocet on a small&nbsp; 
  dam.<BR>&gt; Dusky Nightjars were very common, but no nightjars of&nbsp; any 
  species were<BR>&gt; calling.<BR>&gt; Ethiopian Swallows were very numerous 
  over much of&nbsp; the area, adults and<BR>&gt; immatures, and one adult was 
  prospecting in the&nbsp; office.<BR>&gt; Barn Swallows were on the move, with 
  over 100 adults&nbsp; clustered together on<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; the morning of the 
  26th August. No immatures were&nbsp; recorded.<BR>&gt; An amazing Mosque 
  Swallow, associating with normal&nbsp; coloured Mosque<BR>&gt; Swallows was 
  photographed alongside a very much dwarfed Lesser&nbsp; Striped<BR>&gt; 
  Swallow.<BR>&gt; Instead of having the throat to chest white, and the&nbsp; 
  remainder of the<BR>&gt; underparts rufous chestnut, it was bright 
  chestnut-red from&nbsp; chin to vent,<BR>&gt; although<BR>&gt; being early 
  morning there was undoubtedly an influence&nbsp; of the low<BR>&gt; 
  sunlight.<BR>&gt; Just on entering the ranch I stepped out of the car&nbsp; 
  and heard some<BR>&gt; Black-lored Babblers calling, but did not see them. 
  Maybe they&nbsp; were vepres,<BR>&gt; but<BR>&gt; that would seem to be a long 
  way from Mt Kenya. Something to&nbsp; look out for<BR>&gt; next time. Brown 
  Babbler is there, but we did not run into it on&nbsp; this<BR>&gt; 
  ocassion.<BR>&gt; Everything else was much as would be expected. A&nbsp; 
  complete list of species<BR>&gt; recorded follows.<BR>&gt; Best for 
  now<BR>&gt; Brian<BR>&gt; PS for the botanists. In Najma Dharani’s, 
  Acacia&nbsp; guide, she names several<BR>&gt; new species of acacias. One of 
  these is Acacia&nbsp; tirion, a very rare species<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; confined to 
  the area Kabarnet-Marigat-Baringo. It&nbsp; is unique in having 
  equal<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; armouries of spines and barbs, and is quite&nbsp; 
  formidable. This species is<BR>&gt; abundant on Sosian in an equal abundance 
  with&nbsp; mellifera and brevispica.<BR>&gt; SPECIES RECORDED SOSIAN, 23rd –
