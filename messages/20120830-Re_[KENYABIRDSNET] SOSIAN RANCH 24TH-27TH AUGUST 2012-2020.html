Dear Christian,
Thanks so much for all these details, it helps paint a clearer picture
of the species distribution and frequency. What is the altitude you
are finding these at?
Best for now

Tom and Brian
Somali tits, or what i have always called northern grey are very common
with us.
Black-capped social weavers are common with us and also I believe that
Darcy Ogada recorded a dark chanting goshawk on mpala not very long back.
Some other notes:
Currently a fischers starling flock on us - they usually only come to us
once a year. Our golden-breasted starlings have been seen at the same
location so many times that I suspect they may have even bred. Our two
flocks of scaly chatterers are still about and I have found one more pair
of Pringles puffback. I must be overlooking others but I found my first
tiny cisticola on us recently despite running into them frequently in
steeper country west of the ewaso nyiro. Cheers,

Sorry Tom,
I forgot you were still in Saudi. I will wait until you get back. I
will write to Quentin to ask him what they do not recognise tirion
from, as it has to be something.

Hi  Tom'
Thanks for this, maybe it is moving in. Have you recorded Somali  Tit,
Dark Chanting Goshawk or Grey-backed Fiscal. I think in the case  of
the latter, it has probably been seen before but the relevency  was
never recognised.
Any word from Quentin on Acacia tirion (do you  have it on Mpala?),  I
know he is relaxing on the coast this  week.
We also collected the Vepris for him,  that lives on a kopje  on
Sosian, which has white fruits when ripe rather than red. It  was
identified there as simplicifolia, but apart from white fruits,  the
leaves are trifoliate. Any ideas. Leaves and fruit are in  Nigels
fridge on Quentins instructions.

common bird at my  feeder at Soita Nyiro Conservancy...an enclave
