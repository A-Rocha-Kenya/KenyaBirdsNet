<div class="moz-text-flowed">Have just received a message from Juma Badi at Mida Creek, one of the 
main bird guides at the boardwalk telling me they saw an African Skimmer 
this morning at Mida Creek - this is the first I've heard there though 
there may be records I'm not aware of?
<br>
<br>There have also been several Golden Pipits at Mida the past 4-6 weeks 
which have been a delight to see. First White-throated Bee-eater of the 
season there as well on 24th August.
<br>
<br>Looking at the breeding data for the Roseate Terns on Whale Island over 
the past 12 years, it is very clear that they breed in alternate years - 
every 'odd' year, they breed, and even years they don't. A really 
interesting breeding cycle for them that we are keen to investigate - 
why don't they breed every year like they do on the Seychelles? It may 
also be true on other colonies - certainly this year they didn't breed 
on Kisite - just as they have not on Whale Island. If anyone has any 
information on the northern colonies for this year, it would be really 
useful to know.
