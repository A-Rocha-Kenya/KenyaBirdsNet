The highlights were the owls (Eurasian Scops, White-faced Scops, Greyish Eagle Owl, Spotted Eagle Owl, Pearl Spotted Owlet and Verreaux's Eagle Owl), a spectacular heronry amongst the flooded trees of what was once the shoreline (black-headed herons, squacco herons, black egrets, great-white egrets, little egrets, yellow-billed egrets, reed cormorants, great cormorants,
 black-crowned night heron, darters...wonderful!) and for us the red-fronter warbler, pale prinia, bristle-crowned starling, Hemprich's Hornbill, Brown-tailed Rock Chat, Great Spotted Cuckoo, Rufous Crowned Roller, Yellow-vented Eremomela, Rufous Chatterer and Northern Puffback. The Fish Eagles and Goliath Herons were glorius and a magnificent pair of Verreaux's Eagles hunted over the cliffs in search of unwary Rock Hyrax. The full list is attached.</SPAN><BR style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal"><BR style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal"><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">We stayed at Soi Safari Lodge, which was fine for food and service with a good pool to cool off in, however it does not offer the natural surrounds and lake-front access you will find at the other Lodges. They also have a caged collection of birds and primates which is awful due to the tiny cages the animals are kept in. They have even a fish eagle in a cage, which is just stupid, you can see them very
 easily in the Lake anyway. Our whole group felt that these animals should be relocated or the facility seriously upgraded.</SPAN></FONT></SPAN></SPAN></H6>
