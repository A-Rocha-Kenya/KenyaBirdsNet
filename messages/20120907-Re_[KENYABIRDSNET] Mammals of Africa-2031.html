 Hi Kapanya,
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

All volumes of Mammals of Africa are expected  to be published at the same
time....and ready for distribution by end of  February 2013.  How payment
might be made to Bloomsbury Publishers is  something that I do not yet
know,
but I imagine that payment via credit  card, check or wire transfers will
all
be possible...with credit card probably  being the most expedient for most
of us.

I am copying this to Nigel Redman, Head of Natural History,  Bloomsbury
Publishers, so that he can keep the Kenya and Tanzania Birds Groups
informed
concerning the publication of MOA...and how best to make payment.   If we
do
not hear from Nigel for a few weeks, it is because he is leaving London
about now for a bird tour in Djibouti and Somaliland (lucky him).   Nigel
has
lead many bird tours to East Africa. As such, I am sure that he will  be
pleased to keep the Kenya and Tanzania Birds Groups informed as concerns
MOA.

Best wishes,

Tom

Hi Tom,
Thannk you for both very exciting news about Eurasian Bee Eaters  and
Mammal of Africa Book!
I hope that the Eurasian Bee Eaters will be allover in Tanzania end  of
this Sept and early Oct. From my observation around Arusha and Usa  River,
I
found that their arrival is normally to coincide with Jacaranda  trees??!


About the Book, is it all 6 volumes ready; how one can pay and when  to do
so?


Thank you.

About 10  days ago I saw the first European Bee-eaters pass through
Thumamah (near Riyadh, Saudi Arabia) but, perhaps, I did not see  the
first of
them.

On another subject, Mammals of Africa is  expected to be published in
February.

Tom

The mammals are  coming:
