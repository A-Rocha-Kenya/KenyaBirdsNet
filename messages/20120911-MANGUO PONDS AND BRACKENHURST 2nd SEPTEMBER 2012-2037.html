Dear All,
Fleur Ng'Weno, Karen Plumbe and myself gathered at 7.00am at Nigel Hunters house for a morning in the Limuru area. 
It was misty on the way up with quite consistent light drizzle, but cleared soon after we arrived at Manguo Ponds. They were still growing it seemed, and the water was right up to the main highway. The water was still open, and the aquatic sedges (not the choking sedges that were dominant for the past two years), forming a short but dense dark green swathe around the margins. No migrant ducks as yet, but a good variety of resident species including three (one drake) Maccoa and an impressive fifty-five White-backed Ducks, two Fulvous Whistling-Ducks and ten Southern Pochards. Migrant waders were five Wood, one each of Marsh and Green Sandpipers and two Little Stints. The only other sighting of interest was a Madagascar Pond Heron. The sewage lagoon around the corner had a few Glossy Ibis, a Black-crowned Night-Heron, six Wood Sandpiper and a Common Greenshank, a very nice Red-throated Wryneck, a  number of Golden-winged and Malachite Sunbirds.
At Brackenhurst we had a number of species that reach their closest proximity to Nairobi, these included Blue-headed Coucal and a few Tacazze Sunbirds. This really is a low elevation for this species but they are resident here as are Eastern Double-collared Sunbirds, the commenest sunbird present.

Best to all
Brian
