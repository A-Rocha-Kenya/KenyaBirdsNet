Dear CMC,

It was recently observed by a member of the Kenyan Birdwatching community
that you have removed several trees that were used by nesting Marabou
Storks.  In the process several birds were killed and left to die on the
street.  I find that kind of flagrant disregard for the welfare of birds
/
animal life  rather sickening and it makes me wonder what other kind of
morally questionable things your company gets up to.  I am not a wealthy
person so the loss of my business may be of no more consequence to you
than
the loss of a Marabou nest. Just the same I can assure you that there are
hundreds of others who feel as I do and who would like to see your
company
move forward with a bit more of a sense of decency and respect for the
natural world.

Sincerely,
