<br>Dear All,
<br>
<br>You will recall that in November 2011, I reported on the pair of Grey Parrots seen frequently in the Spring Valley Road area.
<br>
<br>Well, the pair has either had a happy event or found a friend, because there are now 3 birds!!&nbsp; They all look about the same size, so difficult to say if the original 2 have become parents or not.
<br>
<br>They have been absent for several months, but returned this week, and were seen last week, at a distance, and I was sure there were 3 birds.&nbsp; Today I have had two good sightings of all 3 feeding in top of our Erythrina tree that is currently flowering.
<br>
<br>Birders in the Spring Valley area might be lucky enough to add them to their list of birds seen during the World Bird Watch on 6/7 October!
<br>
<br>Best wishes,
<br>
<br>Philip.
