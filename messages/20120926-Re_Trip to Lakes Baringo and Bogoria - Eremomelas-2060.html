After some advice from Brian, I am thinking that the Yellow-Vented Eremomela on our list might be a juvenile Yellow-Bellied Eremomela.

I have posted the pictures on birdnet:

Hi,
Thank you for the report on your 3 days trip to Lake Bogoria and Baringo. You wrote that the group which was leaded by Wilson Tiren saw a Eurasian Scops Owl, but in your full list which was attached you wrote African Scops Owl, it could have been a typing error in writing Eurasian instead of African. 
You had Peter Usher in your group, did he take any pictures of the Eurasian/African Scops Owl, Greyish Eagle Owl and Spotted Eagle Owl.
Shailesh

Hello!
Sukhy Soin &amp; Bee Soin, Wendy Ayres, Peter &amp; Anne Usher, Alan King, Catherine Ngarachu, Peter Steward and I went on a 3 day trip to Bogoria and Baringo lakes. Wilson Tiren was our guide and hats off to him he showed many of us lifers galore. The highlights were the owls (Eurasian Scops, White-faced Scops, Greyish Eagle Owl, Spotted Eagle Owl, Pearl Spotted Owlet and Verreaux's Eagle Owl), a spectacular heronry amongst the flooded trees of what was once the shoreline (black-headed herons, squacco herons, black egrets, great-white egrets, little egrets, yellow-billed egrets, reed cormorants, great cormorants, black-crowned night heron, darters...wonderful!) and for us the red-fronter warbler, pale prinia, bristle-crowned starling, Hemprich's Hornbill, Brown-tailed Rock Chat, Great Spotted Cuckoo, Rufous Crowned Roller, Yellow-vented Eremomela, Rufous Chatterer and Northern Puffback. The Fish Eagles and Goliath Herons were glorius and a magnificent pair of
 Verreaux's Eagles hunted over the cliffs in search of unwary Rock Hyrax. The full list is attached.

We stayed at Soi Safari Lodge, which was fine for food and service with a good pool to cool off in, however it does not offer the natural surrounds and lake-front access you will find at the other Lodges. They also have a caged collection of birds and primates which is awful due to the tiny cages the animals are kept in. They have even a fish eagle in a cage, which is just stupid, you can see them very easily in the Lake anyway. Our whole group felt that these animals should be relocated or the facility seriously upgraded.
Pete Steward and Radhika Timbadia
