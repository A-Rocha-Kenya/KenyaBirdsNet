Thanks Colin,
It would be interesting to learn if there are quite a number of
WFscops in the cashew plantations, I don't think there is too much
else, but you never know if you don't look.
Glad you saw the Violet-breasted Sunbirds, I estimated there were 100
birds at least moving between the flowering Combretums. As we know so
little about this species, because there was a constant flow of birds
arriving and departing at bush height, I thought that if this happens
again next mid-April it would be interesting to ring them. It would
help to estimate numbers as well as hopefully lead to controls in the
future. I don't think you would get a recovery but you never know. Can
you send me a photo of the bird you caught at Mwamba. I have never
ever seen a good photograph of the species, although I did get some
nice video of them back in April. Amazingly on my July tour there was
a male at the lily pond near the Sabaki Bridge.
Very best for now
Brian

Hi Brian,

Thanks for this. The White-faced has not infrequently been brought into
Bio-Ken snake farm as chicks or injured adults and talking to locals around
here, it does not seem uncommon in farmland in behind Gede and around
Malindi. It seems to survive even in cashewnut plantations, surprisingly. I
will see if we can get out and get some recordings of its call... I'll talk
to David Ngala about it as he should have more information. I guess people
have not recorded it as not many birders go birding in cashew nut shambas!!
I confess I don't - tho perhaps I should! - though I have thought several
times about doing bird surveys in farmland as it would be very interesting
to do that esp in conjunction with an indigenous tree-planting programme in
the community... When we have more capacity in A Rocha Kenya, we'll do it!

Yes, I did get to see the Violet-breasted at Sabaki - awesome. We even
caught and ringed a male here at Mwamba which we put photos of up on our A
Rocha Kenya facebook page.

Best,

Colin

Hi Colin,
Good that Broad-bills have already made an entry. Little Stints may be
inland at present, there were over 500 at Bogoria at a roosting area
near the main entrance, which including an intriguing one with a white
rump which I photographed.
Am interested by the White-faced Scops Owl, which would be a southern.
They have a far more dramatic call than Northern, and it is surprising
that if they were more numerous than records suggest then people would
be hearing them. I have only ever seen the species twice in Kenya
(having heard them first), both times the same valley near Eremit off
the Oltepesi Road, which comes off the Magadi Road. How often have you
come across them?
Did you ever get down to Sabaki mid April to see all the
Violet-breasted Sunbirds on the Combretums?
Best for now
Brian

Just back from a waterfowl count at Sabaki River Mouth. Reasonable
numbers of birds though very few Little Stints which was surprising.
Mangroves are invading even faster and sand continues to fill in the
soft, deeper mud thus reducing the area available for waders to feed.
Having said that, it may be expanding further south - we need to do a
proper GIS project on it to really understand what is going on.

Birds of interest were:
- Broad-billed Sandpiper have returned (last month we saw none) with
c.25 counted (totals being tallied still)
- Peregrine - 1 adult flew over disturbing all the waders and headed
off
north. Probably a male judging by the size
- almost 300 whistling duck - both White-fronted &amp; Fulvous
- 3 Knob-billed Duck
- 1 Af Open-billed Stork on the river and a further 5 in the
lily-covered pool by the bridge
- best bird was an adult Palmnut Vulture - my first record for Sabaki
- Black Heron - doing his umbrella fishing act in the pool by the
bridge
- Grey-headed Kingfisher

Very few gulls and terns today - a few Common and Saunders and one
Caspian Tern.

Other records of note from the Mida Creek Bird Club:
3rd Sept - single African Skimmer - a new species for Mida Creek as far
as I am aware
7th Sept - single Eurasian Oystercatcher
16th Sept - 6 Pink-backed Pelicans (not at all common at Mida)
17th Sept - White-faced Scops Owl - this species is probably far
commoner around here than is suggested in the literature
