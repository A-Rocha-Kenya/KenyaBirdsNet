<p>A few years ago we had these discussions on the various subspecies/species of Crested Guineafowl in our region. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Though I see them regularly in the Tana Delta when they are coming to roost or waking up in the forest where we normally see the endangered Tana Mangabey they have been impossible to photograph.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are also present in the Umani Springs groundwater forest in Kibwezi, about halfway between the coast and the mountains (and at about 1000 m altitude) but have been similarly elusive to the camera. However, yesterday morning at sunrise they were foraging in the dry forest together with a bunch of baboons. I took a few shots that appeared totally black but with Photoshop it is actually possible to extract something (attached). So it is clearly the nominate race with the red around the eye, the red throat and the speckled neck. This is quite interesting as botanically Quentin Luke also found there are strong affinities with the lowland coastal forests. I have also seen Black-headed Batis there.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this forest is quickly dying because of politically motivated overabstraction of the Umani Springs and the wetlands have dried out (see the April 2012 issue of Swara) and to add insult &nbsp;to injury they also want to take the new Nairobi-Mombasa powerline smack through some of the most beautifil parts of the forest (with centuries old Newtonia). Of course this is totally illegal, but who cares?</p>
