Our birding group visited the Lumo Conservancy in May 2012, five months 
later I finally have the time to process my photos! I have these images
 of a cisticola we initially though was Desert Cisticola, but now I am 
not sure. From the illustrations in Zimmerman and S&amp;F it looks like
 it could also be Ashy or Siffling Cisticola. I cannot see a plain 
rufous rump or black tail with white-tips which suggests that it is not a
 Desert Cisticola and it is outside of the range for a Pectoral-patch 
Cisticola. Unfortunately it was so long ago that I can&#39;t remember the 
song.<br><br><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/kenyabirdsnet/photos/album/1173400137/pic/list">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/kenyabirdsnet/photos/album/1173400137/pic/list</a><br>
<br>Does anyone know which cisticola this is with a degree of certainty?
 It was in a small bush (pair) in dry open grassland (&lt;1000 m), part 
of the wider Tsavo ecosystem.<br><br>Many thanks,<br><br>Pete Steward<br><br><br>
