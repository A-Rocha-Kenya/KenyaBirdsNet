Thanks Kuria for this and all those mails to CMC and the fact that we can
all stand up as a group to ask them a question. I guess the CMC manger
will or has talked about it with the fellow managers over some drinks and
that would have created awareness to the others. Great Job and hope this
can keep on.<br><br>
This might be late but yes i saw the three acacia stumps cut outside the
CMC Showroom somedays ago. Therefore, i think yes CMC would be
responsible with the cutting. They seemed very close or just next to the
windows of their showroom. I'd imagine the trees and birds might have
posed a problem for them or even with their insurance company (I don't
know but i just guess) and may be they had to bring them down for
whatever the reasons they had good enough or not. <br><br>
However, before cutting a tree in Nairobi you need a reason and some
payment done in favour of the County Council of Nairobi (CCN) to get
the&nbsp; licence to bring down the tree.&nbsp; Therefore, i'd much think
it must mean that if indeed it was the CMC they must have had CCN's go
ahead and a licence. <br><br>
To me on the scene, it was most worrying and annoying and heart touching
and even disturbing to see a youngbird like one that has just been kicked
out of the nest some weeks or days before the fledging day and the party
was over sat a few meter to the CMC's Showroom and guess it must have
come from the nests brought down. Pretty much a pity. <br><br>
However, it's not the first time this has happened (we can remember some
years back along the City Hall in the name of cleaning the town) and
probably not the last time this will happen especially in a cases where
one cannot insure a property because it sits under a tree that could come
down any time rendering the insurance company to pay for damages that
could have been avoided. <br><br>
So while we accuse CMC (i being one of them) i'd suggest that we also
point at the CCN's Department of Environment for licensing bringing down
a tree with nesting birds. <br>
In addition the NMK's Bird Section and KWS which are much closer to us
(birdwatchers) than CCN, would also be very good institutions to write to
the CCN asking them to not licence cutting of such tree if currently
having birds nesting eg incubating or feeding nestlings. I guess we
forget about roosting birds for now but breeding ones.<br><br>
Many businesses and probably us too will not want Marabous over their
parking lots, we all know how messy they can be. Though i'm not a
researcher, never counted them and neither do i have little clue of how
many birds are in the city, we probably don't want the ever increasing
numbers of these Marabous in the city They are even taking over the Athi
Dam in the Nairobi Park and the acacia riverine area in the park. However
i find it MOST RUTHLESS thing to bring down a tree with such a fledgling
whose mother wasted a couple of weeks building a nest, a month and a
half&nbsp; of incubating mostly fasting and with very little food, sited
over a nest in a tree in Nairobi (City in the Sun) then spending 3month
feeding the chicks and just before they fledge the tree is cut down and
some others nest with eggs and so on.<br><br>
In this case, the approach i'd take (personal and ready to be corrected)
is that the business wanting&nbsp; to bring down the tree would rather
and should first bring down the nest from the start of beginning of nest
building. A few repeated times will keep off the nest building pairs of
these storks and they'd have to find another tree. This way they will
only brought a week long and not 6months of breeding into mere waste.
After they have kept the birds off from nesting on the tree then they can
be allowed to bring down the tree if in deed the tree need to be brought
down.<br><br>
For your info, KAA at the JKI Airport did bring down the nests of the
Little Swift a few weeks ago in the name of cleaning the bridge tunnel
after the main barrier.&nbsp; Pity little gems<br><br>
NB/ Mombasa Road is under construction or going soon to be in to a super
highway and there are many Cattle Egrets and Sacred Ibises nesting
in&nbsp; the middle of the dual carriage so it may be good for the NMK
and KWS to start discouraging new nesting birds before the chinese super
machines&nbsp; bring down the trees in a month when they are all full of
eggs and young ones.<br><br>
Pss: about 3 weeks ago i counted about 250 Caspian Plovers in Masai Mara
National Reserve between Talek area and Musiara, more few Black-backed
Cisticolas near the Olololoo Gate<br><br>
Away from birds but even much worrying......just received an sms from a
friend James Kariuki doing de-snarring in Western side of Masai Mara
National Park and today alone they removed 125 snares, rescued 5 animals,
seen many many dead and rotting snares <br><br>
Many regards and great birding<br>
