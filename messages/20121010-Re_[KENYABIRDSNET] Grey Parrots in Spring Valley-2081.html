Dear Philip <br>
We had one very thin and weak that appeared to our office door one early
morning in fed last year with a broken leg and an injured wing. We
accommodated her with us in the office and stayed with us nursing her
slowly she got better and in great fit. Very messy chap, i.e one
afternoon she was sat on the table and i went out for a couple of minutes
and coming back she had plucked 3 key tabs from a computer keyboard.
However, she was still fun to have around only we got worried that she
was now physically fit all lonely and we did not want to start looking
for another but probably give it out to someone who had some already. She
started flying out on trees nearby and flying back, by this time she had
already healed. But one morning late last year she flew all the way
across the road to City Park never to come back. May be she may have
found the pair and joined. I do hope they do not find their way across
the rift valley to Kakamega just in case there were carrying
diseases<br><br>
So would that be a TICK seeing one in nairobi?<br><br>
Many regards<br>

Dear All,<br><br>
You will recall that in November 2011, I reported on the pair of Grey
<br>
Parrots seen frequently in the Spring Valley Road area.<br><br>
Well, the pair has either had a happy event or found a friend, because
<br>
there are now 3 birds!! They all look about the same size, so <br>
difficult to say if the original 2 have become parents or not.<br><br>
They have been absent for several months, but returned this week, and
<br>
were seen last week, at a distance, and I was sure there were 3 <br>
birds. Today I have had two good sightings of all 3 feeding in top of
<br>
our Erythrina tree that is currently flowering.<br><br>
Birders in the Spring Valley area might be lucky enough to add them to
<br>
their list of birds seen during the World Bird Watch on 6/7
October!<br><br>
Best wishes,<br><br>
Philip.<br><br>
