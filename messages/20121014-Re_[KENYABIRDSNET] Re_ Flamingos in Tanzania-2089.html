Dear Simon and all,

My husband Pat went up to Lake Nakuru on the 25th August 2012 just for the day, 
he said that there was a lot of water everywhere but they had a great day and saw 
quite a bit including lions. They are not "birders" at such but I checked with him and 
he says they did see flamingos,not a lot but they were definitly there.I am sorry,they 
were not sure whether they were Greater or Lesser but they were flamingos.

One Albatros, looked like an immature as brownish, too far away to identify properly 
but probably a Shy which is our usual one, was seen in the Pemba Channel about 
midway between Kenya and Pemba Island on the Thursday 4th October 2012. The 
first one seen off here for at least two years.

During two safaris to Lake Nakuru here  in Kenya in August- not one flamingo was seen. Not a lesser not a greater !!

 

The lake is extremely flooded with freshwater presumably thus denying algal feeding for the flamingos..

 

Was wondering where they have all gone to?

Hi Pete

 

We are going by Manyara on Saturday on our way to Eyasi and Kitangire (all 3 very important flamingo lakes) and will certainly look and count whenever possible.

 

I'm sending this msg to our email group and the Kenya group just in case someone can comment on lack of birds at any particular lake. 

 

Our major flamingo count issue has always been that we never have people at all the lakes on the same day so we never know if absence from any particular lake means anything unusual.

 

I assume you are asking Graham and the guys in Namibia and SA.

 

More very soon and for sure I'll talk to folk at the PAOC.

Subject: Flamingos in Tanzania

 

Hi Neil,

 

I hope this note finds you and Liz in good health. I´m writing to find out if there is anything unusual going on with Lesser Flamingos in Tanzania - we are inundated with flocks here in the Okavango Delta where they´ve never been seen in the past 30 years. Because they are turning up in unusual (and unsuitable) places, and because they are sometimes seen flying during the day, ITMm ypothesising that they are strangers to Botswana i.e. birds from East Africa. I heard that Lak Nakuru is very deeply flooded this year and that no suitable habitt for flamingos exists there. WhatTMs the situation in where you are " any comments?

 

I know a link between the southern African and East African populations has long been hypothesised, but I don´t think these birds move regularly - only when they have to, as when there is a major disruption in one area. Please do me a favour and ask around at the PAOC to see what others think - regrettably I´ll not be there.

 

Many thanks, and all the best

Pete
