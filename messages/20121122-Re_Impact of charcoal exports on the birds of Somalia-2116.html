Somalia. As you may have heard, the Kenya army took over the port of Kismayu 
about a month and a half ago. They found a huge stock of c. 4 million sacks of 
charcoal waiting to be exported. About 3 million sacks are in or near Kismayu 
and another million at Buur Gabo, an estuary and village of the same name up the 
coast from Ras Kamboni and the Kenya border. Although the UN (and the Somali 
government) have banned all export of charcoal from Somalia first&nbsp;the 
Kenyan army, then&nbsp;the Kenyan government, the African Union, and IGAD have 
all asked the UN Security Council &nbsp;to temporarily lift the ban to permit 
the export of the charcoal.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Security Council has declined to lift 
the ban, but&nbsp;the Kenya army is permitting it to be exported, with the 
connivance of local militia and politicians in both Somalia and Kenya. This has 
apparently encouraged the continuation of charcoal production for export. 
Needless to say this is environmentally unsustainable, and has caused unknown 
damage to the Jubba valley forest and the Boni forest/Bush Bush National Reserve 
which between them have 50 bird species not found anywhere else in Somalia. Much 
of the charcoal going out of Kismayu must be coming from the Jubba valley, and 
presumably all of the charcoal at Buur Gabo must be coming from Bush Bush and 
the Somali part of the Boni Forest.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>I don't know if there is 
anything that BirdLife can do about this, but I thought you should know about 
it.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>I am attaching a list of the 50 bird 
species.<BR><BR></DIV></FONT></FONT></FONT></BODY></HTML>
