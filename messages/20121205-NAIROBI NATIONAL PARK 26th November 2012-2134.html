The weather started off mild and overcast, and became progressively colder and more overcast although there had been little overnight rain and the place was drying out.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Our first stop was the KWS mess garden, where the<b> Nightingales </b>were feeding once again on the rubbish tip! It makes them very easy to observe. There were four present. Ivory Burning Site failed to deliver, and Nagalomon Dam could muster up six <b>Green Sandpipers </b>and that was it. The<b> Spotted Thick-</b>knee was at its usual site on the drift.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Along the back road we had<b> African Water Rails </b>calling and a nice<b> Common Snipe.<o:p></o:p></b></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Hyena Dam was attracting a few birds, with a<b> Yellow-billed Stork, African Spoonbill</b>, a strange ring-necked<b> Western Marsh Harrier</b>, calling<b> African Water Rails</b>, a remarkable assemblage of fifty<b> Wood Sandpipers </b>plus a couple of<b> Green</b>, a couple of inderterminate female<b> Yellow Wagtails, </b>a few of not many<b> Barn Swallows</b> today and a couple of<b> Whinchats. <o:p></o:p></b></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>On the Hyena Dam run-off there was a pair of<b> Saddle-billed Storks, </b>a dozen<b> Eurasian Bee-eaters, </b>a couple of<b> Rosy-breasted Longclaws, </b>three more<b> Whinchats, </b>five<b> Jackson&#8217;s Widowbirds </b>in breeding dress (as were the<b> Red-collared </b>and<b> White-winged</b>)<b> </b>and a very nice breeding male<b> Parasitic Weaver.<o:p></o:p></b></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>We broke our usual circuit to retrace back to the Main Entrance to drop Fleur off at the gate, on the way there was a stunning<b> Emerald Cuckoo </b>singing for all it was worth from a completely exposed perch.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Across to Karen Primary School Dam there was a male<b> Kori Bustard</b>, the first for some time, and a<b> Spur-winged Goose </b>and another<b> Spotted Thick-knee at Eland Hollow. <o:p></o:p></b></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>At Athi Dam there was an adult<b> Pink-backed Pelican, </b>a single<b> White </b>Stork with a good collection of thirty<b> Yellow-billed Storks </b>in all plumages, six<b> African Spoonbills</b>, the same<b> Pallid Harrier </b>female as the previous week and an adult<b> Fish Eagle </b>terrorising a <b>Sacred Ibis </b>which took refuge in deeper water, which seemed to work. In the resident wader line there were still thirty<b> Spur-winged </b>Plovers and a similar number of<b> Kittlitz&#8217;s </b>Plovers and three<b> Black-winged Stilts. </b>Migrant waders additionally included two <b>Ringed Plovers</b>, a dozen<b> Little Stint, </b>and single<b> Common Greenshank </b>and<b> Common Sandpiper. </b>There was a<b> Red-throated Pipit </b>along the shore and two immature<b> Black-crowned Night-Herons </b>on the causeway<b>.<o:p></o:p></b></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>On our return via the Mbagathi River we found an immature<b> Black Stork, </b>two<b> Steppe Eagles </b>and a solitary<b> Grey-headed Silverbill</b>.

There were another three <b>Lions</b> on the Main Entrance road.
