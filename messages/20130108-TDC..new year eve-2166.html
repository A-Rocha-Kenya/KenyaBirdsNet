Visited Dr. Mwangi Githiru at Wildlife Works that used to be Taita
Discovery Centre on 31st Dec and 1st Jan<br><br>
Harlequin Quils were JUST every where calling every where during the day
and at all night long.....pretty 24 hrs singing. After the midnight toss
both Harlequin Quil and&nbsp; Donaldson Smith Nightjar sang and couldn't
figure out which was one was my first bird for 2013.<br><br>
3 different Friedmann's Larks&nbsp; kept calling but never saw any. Ashy
Cisiticola were quite common too in opens.<br><br>
A male Red-billed Hornbill has a nest barely a meter from Mwangi's house
and at eye level when seated and seemed not much bothered by our presence
as he fed the jailed female or and juvs.<br><br>
Never before had i seen two pairs of Pigmy Falcon in less than 200m apart
and one pair was courtship displaying like the d'Anaurds Barbet do
flicking tail straight up and down<br><br>
Pangani Lonclaw were present, Fire-fronted Bishop very common in breeding
plumage and one male in the middle if Maungu Trading Centre, a single
male Hartlaub's Bustard<br><br>
NOT any way sure...but saw a crombec in seconds carrying nesting material
but never saw any rufous chestnut on the bird or any major eye stripe.
Never had any view of the bill length thou.....but thought i might have
seen a Somali Crombec.... she called and i tried to call the bird but
never re-appeared. Also never looked at it through my bins but the camera
as i was trying to photograph another birds. However, got a photo of the
back and blurred face......... which might not be enough to tell. When
Mwangi has chance will check it out<br><br>
cheers<br>
