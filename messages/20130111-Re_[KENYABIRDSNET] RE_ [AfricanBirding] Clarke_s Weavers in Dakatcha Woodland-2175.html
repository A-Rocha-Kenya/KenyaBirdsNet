Dear Fleur and all the Dakatcha team,
This is really exciting, and you are obviously close to solving the
mystery. I thought that they would be breeding in the Galana oxbows,
seasonal wetlands never occurred to me.
All interior forest weavers are non-social in breeding, so it made
sense that Clarke's would be in a wetland being such a highly social
species. I wonder how long the wetland has been there, if breeding had
been nearly over then you would have seen young birds... maybe they
are prospecting for a site now and the best is yet to come!
Congratulations again
Brian

Dear Jeremy and all

Indeed, it was when Martin Odino saw the first Weyns¹s Weaver in Kenya in
October 2010 that I realized that Clarke¹s Weaver would probably also nest
in wetlands. Since then we have been looking in many seasonal wetlands and
hidden oxbow lakes as well as in Brachystegia woodland.

The Clarke¹s Weavers we saw this week were not building or feeding young,
and the only nests we saw were Grosbeak Weavers¹. Monitoring will continue,
however ­ although not every day, for fear of disturbing the birds.

With best wishes to all, Fleur

Dear Fleur and team,
This is really interesting. It¹s sounding very like the (similar looking)
Weyns¹s Weaver story in Uganda, also a social forest weaver - which is odd
in
itself - with long uncertainty about breeding sites. For Weyn¹s these
eventually proved to be in papyrus swamps on edge of Lake Victoria...(M.
Mills, 2007: Scopus 26: 44-46). I assume from your description that you
could
see enough to rule out breeding, or is it possible there were nests hidden
in
the vegetation that you couldn¹t see?
Best wishes
Jeremy

Subject: [AfricanBirding] Clarke's Weavers in Dakatcha Woodland

Some exciting news from Dakatcha Woodland IBA in Kenya:

The first week of January 2013, a monitoring team from Nature Kenya and
Dakatcha Woodland Conservation Group visited Dakatcha Woodland IBA to look
for
Clarke's Weavers. The group comprised Albert Baya, Japheth Garama, Samson
Katisho, Julius Mwambire, Kazungu Mboro Thuva, Samson Barisa, Maxwel
Issa,
Jonathan Kalama, Annet Sifa, Faith Mbago, George Odera and myself, Fleur
Ng'weno. It had rained heavily in December, and many of the small wetlands
had
filled with water and water lilies.

At about 10 am on January 6, after a survey in Brachystegia forest, we
drove
along the edge of a low area lush with grasses. A small part of it seemed
to
be deeper, with two kinds of Cyperus sedges growing in water. To our
surprise
and delight, we saw a flock of Clarke  217;s Weavers among the sedges.

The Clarke¹s Weavers were flying in and out, chattering, perching on the
sedges and on a tree and bush among the grasses, then disappearing among
the
sedges. Small flocks flew out and disappeared over the trees, and others
arrived and landed in the wetland. We estimated more than 100 Clarke¹s
Weavers, most of them males in adult plumage. There were also some females
(or
possibly immature males).

In the same wetland there were several Grosbeak Weavers, mostly males,
with
some old nests. They were displaying, singing, chasing each other and
sometimes chasing the Clarke¹s Weavers. There was also a flock of about
40
Red-headed Quelea, mostly males, flying and landing with the Clarke¹s
Weavers;
this is a probable range extension. We observed the birds and their
constant
activity from our vehicle for about an hour and a half.

As we did not want to disturb the birds, we left, then returned in the
evening
a t 5:30 pm to observe from the vehicle until about 7 pm. There was less
activity, and no queleas, but small flocks of Clarke¹s Weavers continued
to
fly in and out. The Grosbeak Weavers and at least some of the Clarke¹s
Weavers
remained in the sedges at nightfall.

The next morning, January 7, we were back at 5:30 am, still dark.
Grosbeak
Weavers became active at about 6 am, the Clarke¹s Weavers later. They
appeared
from the sedges, and small flocks flew out. As we left at about 7:30 am,
a
larger group of Clarke¹s Weavers flew in.

Our last observation was in the afternoon from 4:30 to about 5 pm. At
first
everything seemed quiet, then a few Clarke¹s Weavers were seen among the
sedges, and several small groups flew in. In short, we had observed
Clarke¹s
Weavers in this wetland for two days and one night.

To the best of my knowledge, this is the first observation of Clarke¹s
Weavers
roosting in a wetland. (Or roosting anywhere for that matter?) The
behaviour
of the birds seemed to indicate they were evaluating the site as a
potential
breeding site. We plan to continue monitoring the site, and detailed
results
will be published.

This observation underscores the importance of conserving seasonal
wetlands as
well as Brachystegia forest for the survival of Clarke¹s Weavers. Our
thanks
to Nature Kenya and the communities of Dakatcha Woodland IBA for their
efforts
in conservation.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
