Wow Chege,
What a fantastic start to the new year, and all whilst sober too!
About that Crombec..... there is something very strange about the
Red-faced in the Tsavos, whilst there are some normally coloured
birds, there are also those that have no rufous at all and are creamy
grey pretty much all over. This has led to many reports of Somali
Crombec, but they just aren't. I cannot get past bleached out
Red-faced, I have even seen it in the hand at Ngulia. It would be
interesting to see if there are any difference in vocalisations, but I
cannot imagine three crombec species being in the same scrub, with
Northern being common as well.... but you never know. Is there any way
the nest can be monitored, because I think that this is a very
important find.
Best for now
Brian

Visited Dr. Mwangi Githiru at Wildlife Works that used to be Taita
Discovery Centre on 31st Dec and 1st Jan

Harlequin Quils were JUST every where calling every where during the
day and at all night long.....pretty 24 hrs singing. After the
midnight toss both Harlequin Quil and  Donaldson Smith Nightjar sang
and couldn't figure out which was one was my first bird for 2013.

3 different Friedmann's Larks  kept calling but never saw any. Ashy
Cisiticola were quite common too in opens.

A male Red-billed Hornbill has a nest barely a meter from Mwangi's
house and at eye level when seated and seemed not much bothered by
our presence as he fed the jailed female or and juvs.

Never before had i seen two pairs of Pigmy Falcon in less than 200m
apart and one pair was courtship displaying like the d'Anaurds Barbet
do flicking tail straight up and down

Pangani Lonclaw were present, Fire-fronted Bishop very common in
breeding plumage and one male in the middle if Maungu Trading Centre,
a single male Hartlaub's Bustard

NOT any way sure...but saw a crombec in seconds carrying nesting
material but never saw any rufous chestnut on the bird or any major
eye stripe. Never had any view of the bill length thou.....but
thought i might have seen a Somali Crombec.... she called and i tried
to call the bird but never re-appeared. Also never looked at it
through my bins but the camera as i was trying to photograph another
birds. However, got a photo of the back and blurred face.........
which might not be enough to tell. When Mwangi has chance will check it out

cheers
