NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 7th January 2013

Dear All,
On 7th January after some rearranging, Mike Davidson, Jennifer Oduore,
Karen Plumbe and myself were kindly transported around the Park by Mrs
Watt, who was relatively new to birding but highly hooked and had over
sixty new species bringing her to over three hundred for her Kenyan
list.
We were through the Main Gate a little before 7.00am, there had been
some recent light rain with heavier falls three days before but none
of the roads had become impassable although the inside road to Karen
PS Dam had become sticky.
We commenced at the KWS Mess Garden, where there were a few birds
showing activity in the sunlight. Amongst these were a Nightingale
sitting on a post next to the rubbish tip, a Spotted Flycatcher on the
fence, a couple of Garden Warblers, six or so Blackcaps, and the
Black-collared Apalis in the hedge still present.
