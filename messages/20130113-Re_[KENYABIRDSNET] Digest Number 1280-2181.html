Neil,

Besides Text Book Centre, also with another branch in Kijabe St.,
check also at Book Point which is in Moi Ave. opposite Ibrahims &amp;
almost at the junction with Kenyatta Ave. A bookshop housed in bldg
where New Stanley Hotel is (along Kenyatta Ave. side) might be worth
checking.

Good luck.

Wamiti.

NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 7th January 2013

NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 7th January 2013

Dear All,
On 7th January after some rearranging, Mike Davidson, Jennifer Oduore,
Karen Plumbe and myself were kindly transported around the Park by Mrs
Watt, who was relatively new to birding but highly hooked and had over
sixty new species bringing her to over three hundred for her Kenyan
list.
We were through the Main Gate a little before 7.00am, there had been
some recent light rain with heavier falls three days before but none
of the roads had become impassable although the inside road to Karen
PS Dam had become sticky.
We commenced at the KWS Mess Garden, where there were a few birds
showing activity in the sunlight. Amongst these were a Nightingale
sitting on a post next to the rubbish tip, a Spotted Flycatcher on the
fence, a couple of Garden Warblers, six or so Blackcaps, and the
Black-collared Apalis in the hedge still present.
From here we went to Ivory Burning Site where another Nightingale
called from cover, but there was nothing else to reward us. A detour
to Nagalomon Dam did reward us however, with a Swamphen coaxed from
cover and a Great Reed Warbler in song in the typha. Along the back of
Hyena Dam, African Water Rails rushed out to wish us a happy 2013, a
couple of Wahlberg’s Honeybirds were chasing each other around the
bushes and a male Syke’s Yellow Wagtail fed on the mud, finally a
couple of Village Indigobirds were on the fence (not usually seen in
the north of the Park for some unknown reason). At Hyena Dam there
were twenty Wood and a few Green Sandpipers, and a few Yellow-crowned
Bishops flew over. One of our few Barn Swallows for the day was here.
On the Hyena Dam run-off there was a female Saddle-billed Stork, a
few Rosy-breasted Longclaws in colour, the first of five Whinchat,
first of three Isabelline Shrikes, all three widowbirds in breeding
dress and five Yellow-crowned Bishops also with males in nuptial
plumage. Eland Hollow failed to produce, and Karen PC Dam gave up a
handsome adult Black Stork and ten more Yellow-crowned Bishops. Near
the Beacon was a male Kori Bustard, another dozen Yellow-crowned
Bishops and our only three Quailfinch of the day.
Athi Basin could only come up with two Northern and one Isabelline
Wheatears, a Long-billed Pipit, and a couple of Pangani Longclaws,
whilst Athi Dam attracted a few birds such as four each Pink-backed
Pelicans and White Stork, only two Yellow-billed Storks, a Little
Egret (always inexplicably rare in NNP), just one Black-winged Stilt,
but some thirty Kittlitz’s and a dozen Spur-winged Plovers. Just three
Little Stints and four Greenshank were all the representatives of
palearctic waders. Along the causeway there was a roosting adult
Black-crowned Night-Heron and a sub-adult Fish Eagle. At Cheetah Gate
there were a few species associated with drier ground like d’Arnaud’s
Barbet, Crimson-rumped and Black-faced Waxbills and several parties of
Speckle-fronted Weavers. Along Rhino Circuit was an interesting mixed
group of Ostrich chicks of every size imaginaeable, about twenty in
number with a pair of adults, single Lesser Spotted Eagle
(horrifyingly the only migrant raptor of the day), and a different
sub-adult Fish Eagle. In the bush were a glowing Pygmy Kingfisher and
another couple of Spotted Flycatchers
We returned via Kingfisher and round to Main Gate, but found nothing
else of interest, and were through the Main Gate just before 5.00pm.
Ornithologically no surprises, and still the feeling that the migrants
are not representing themselves well.

Really large numbers of plains game in the southern parts and
Kingfisher, Zebra and Eland are coming back, and apart from a few
singles there was a group of twenty Wildebeest at Athi Dam. There were
seven White Rhinos near Kingfisher, but nothing really of note in the
mammal department.

Best to all
Brian
