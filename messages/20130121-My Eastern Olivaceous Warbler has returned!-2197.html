Greetings birders

My Eastern Olivaceous Warbler has returned! Well, it's not really mine, and
I can't tell if it is the same one, since it was not ringed and seldom seen.
But in 2012 an Olivaceous Warbler sang its scratchy song in my Nairobi
garden from January 18 to March 25. And today Jan 21 I heard an Olivaceous
Warbler singing again!

At the Annual Waterbird Counts at Thika Sewage Pools yesterday January 19,
migrants included a Little Ringed Plover and small flocks of Garganey,
Northern Shovelers and Northern Pintails, some in fine plumage. Large
numbers of Sacred Ibis sat in the trees like flowers. Clouds of Little
Stints with silver linings of Whiskered and White-winged Terns were
breathtaking.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
