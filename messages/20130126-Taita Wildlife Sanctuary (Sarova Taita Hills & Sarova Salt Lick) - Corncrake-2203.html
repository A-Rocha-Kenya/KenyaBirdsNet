The following list is from a morning in the Taita Wildlife Sanctuary, mostly along the Bura River circuit between the Taita Hills Lodge and Salt Lick. The flowering grass is tall and lush at the moment. Lots of Quails around, definitely saw Harlequins. Highlight was what I think is a Corncrake! I have posted the photos on Wings over Kenya (Facebook group). Also nice Batelur nest along the Bura 'river' valley and a pair of Jackal sunning in short grass opposite Sarova Taita Hills car park.

Total number = 65. Not bad for a quick morning round, and I definitely missed some Cisticolas and Acroceph warblers (I need a birding mentor for wee brown jobs). Saw a distant kestrel but couldn't tell if it was lesser or common, also very distant Hoopoes which were either Green Wood-hoopoes or Common Scimitarbill.

If Common quail are mixed in with the Harlequins what are the ID features best to distinguish between the species as they briefly flush from the roadside into dense cover?
