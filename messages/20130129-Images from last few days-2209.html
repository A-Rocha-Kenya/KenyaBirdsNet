Dear All,
Here are some images from the last few days that may be of some interest.

Ferruginous Duck at Manguo has turned from ugly duckling to beautiful
swan… this is of course not to be read literally.

Black-headed Gull first winter at Hippo Camp Naivasha

White-winged Black Tern, has anyone ever seen the likes of the bird on
the right that apart from the arresting wing-pattern also shows grey
tail and rump. Otherwise a White-winged Black Tern in all other
respects, they are some incredibly variable at this time of year and a
trap for the unwary.

Black-necked Grebe, usually a speck in the middle of a lake, this very
tame individual was living around the “jetty” on Oloidien, it was the
only one we saw and I forgot to mention it in the write-up for last
Sunday.

Little Ringed Plover is a nice bird we don’t see enough of. Very
elegant compared to its buxom relative Common Ringed Plover. Athi Dam
NNP 28th Jan. 29.

This bird was also at the dam yesterday (28th). There was a normal
young Steppe Eagle, which are the bottom two right on the image. The
other Aquila is huge by comparison, with a long wedge shaped tail and
a very black bird. Aquila eagles are a painful group, and research
into available literature might still not come up with an
identification. The bird also shows long neck, but this could be
exaggerated by a full crop, the bill doesn’t strike me as particularly
heavy. It is very black, The wings bowed at the carpal, then upswept
to the splayed brush of the primaries. Comments welcome, but could
still be a very large, very black Steppe.

Finally the Crocodile at Athi Dam. Nice comparison with the Marabous
to give an idea of its dimensions. Wonder where it has been the past
few months.

Best to all
Brian
