Hi Peter,
Thanks for the response, I have seen Peter Ushers picture of the
drake, but did not know of the duck. The last Kenya record I can
recall is ten years ago at Thika when at the same time there were with
the two female Tufteds, two drake Ferruginous and a duck Gadwall.
Best for now
Brian

Hi Brian,

The Tufted Ducks were male and female which we observed in our group,
section 3 of
the Dandora Settling Ponds. I understand the last sighting was about 10
years ago,quite
amazing! Too bad we didnt manage to take any photo though Peter Usher has 1
or 2 of the
Ducks.

Best regards,

Peter Wairasho

DANDORA SETTLING PONDS 24th January 2013.

As part of the waterbird count, Mike Davidson, Jennifer Oduore, Salma
Watt and myself patrolled one fifth of the enormous area. I am not
sure what the species recorded by  the other teams were, I do know
that after we left, a male Tufted Duck was found on another tank. On
our section we did have three Black-headed Gulls, a couple of
Whiskered, fifteen White-winged Black and a Gull-billed Tern, good
numbers of Wood Sandpipers and Ruff, but few other waders, nothing
more interesting than a Ringed Plover. There were 84 Garganey, but no
other palearctic ducks, a Western Marsh Harrier, some 100 Yellow
Wagtails  of which the most interesting was a male Black-headed Yellow
Wagtail (feldegg), the first I have ever seen around Nairobi.

Best to all
Brian
