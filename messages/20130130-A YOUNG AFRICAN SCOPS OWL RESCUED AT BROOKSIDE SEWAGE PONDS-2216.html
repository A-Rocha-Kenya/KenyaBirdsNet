during todays wednesday dirdwalk/counts,  i came across this young owl, picked it from one of the ponds. we all first thought it was spotted eagle owl, but the rapture group confirmed it as scops owl.<br>sheena and I managed to give him a temporary home(carton box), till we took it to the museum and later on taken by Zoe to the ICU. So far, it is doing good and i hope all goes well. attached are photos of the owl after rescue.<br>
<br>enjoy your birding<br>Tabitha<br>
