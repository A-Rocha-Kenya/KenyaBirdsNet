Dear John,
Thanks for the information. How sad not to have the image. Keekerok is
a lot closer to Ruaha Hornbill than Northern Red-billed, we shall just
have to keep on trying.
Thanks again
Brian

Hi Brian,

Thanks for these comments. Re images of the 1988 bird, I was in fact an avid
photographer at the time, but sadly that is one image I don't have!

The sighting was not in fact at Cottars, but inside the Reserve, somewhere
east of Keekorok.

Best regards, John (not Tony) Dawson

Dear All,
Thanks for the response I think you are right about altitude being a
probable factor between northern Serengeti and the Mara, but it
doesn't explain that we have not had it in the Lake Victoria basin
where contiguous vegetation and altitude is identical. On the Tz map,
we actually share three squares where they have been recorded in
Tanzania, admittedly along the border area it looks quite scarce. If a
Racket-tailed Roller can take the plunge, why hasn't a Ruaha
Hornbill!? Tony (Dawson) confirming receipt of your email as
requested. I don't suppose you have an image of the 1988 bird, I know
it was before cameras were invented, but...
It's not impossible that at Cottars, especially in drought conditions
that a Northern Red-bill could wander in, as much as a Ruaha wandering
up.
Best to all
Brian

Adam and all

Altitude is a factor with Grey-breasted Spurfowl (you have a population
of
Red-necked that may help stop our bird) and Fischer's Lovebird (these
birds
love Borassus Palms) and it USED to be with Rufous-tailed Weaver and we
thought with Karamoja Apalis (Acacia drepanolobium).

so it's not simply altitude but there are vegetation changes with alt
and
you need a geologist to look closely at the soils. There is also the
question of subtle changes in temperature to be considered and perhaps
changes in rainfall.

Tony, hopefully you have insights into these ecological limits.

Hi Brian and all,

This is a bird I was determined to find in the Mara and searched
endlessly
for it, particularly while working close to the southern boundary, but to
no
avail.

Despite Britton apparently recording it in the Mara, I wonder if
altitude
may be a prohibitive factor?

Cheers,
Adam

Dear All,
Please look at the attached TZ Atlas map for Ruaha Hornbill. It must
be on our side of the border.
Has anyone seen a Red-billed Hornbill in the Mara (I certainly
haven’t), or along our border area near Lake Victoria, if so it must
be this species, still never recorded for Kenya.
Please check your records, and any images, you could have a first for
the country.
Best to all
Brian
