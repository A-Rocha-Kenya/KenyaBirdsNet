      <p>Dear Martin,<br>
Thanks for sharing the duck image with the net. Your bird is genus<br>
Anas and palearctic.<br>
We can illimiinate several species very quickly remembering that your<br>
bird has an all dark bill and all very sharply contrasting white<br>
underparts.<br>
Mallard, never a black bill, and never white on belly.<br>
Gadwall, in non-breeding always largely yellow bill with very dark<br>
upper mandible. Male approaching breeding may have all dark bill but<br>
then would not have any more white on underparts than centre of lower<br>
belly.<br>
Northern Pintail, mainly grey bill, never blackish, white of belly<br>
restricted to centre.<br>
Northern Shoveler, apart from bill shape shows much orange, never<br>
blacksih bill, no white on belly in any plumage.<br>
Eurasian Wigeon, in all plumages pale blue bill with dark tip, no face<br>
pattern, white on centre of belly.<br>
Common Teal, bill all plumages apart from adult male, dark but with<br>
variable orange at base, adult male all dark grey, no white belly in<br>
any plumages.<br>
Garganey, all dark bill in all plumages, male shows extensive white on<br>
belly as it approaches and is in breeding plumage.<br>
I feel this is what you bird is.<br>
The images show very sharp demarcation of brown upper-breast to head,<br>
and entirely white from flanks to belly. Whilst it is still showing a<br>
non-breeding head the white supercilium is starting to show. Garganey<br>
is the only visiting dabbling duck with white flanks contrasting with<br>
wings, and Tufted Duck is the only other visiting duck with white<br>
flanks.<br>
Hope this helps<br>
Best for now<br>
Brian<br>

&gt; Hi Birders,<br>
&gt; I saw this duck at Lake Turkana. My initial thoughts are that its a Gadwall<br>
&gt; but I have never seen one so I'm not 100%. My guess is based on the white<br>
&gt; belly, small white wing patch (seen in photo 2). It was also a dabbling<br>
&gt; duck.<br>
&gt; I'd appreciate any id help with this.<br>
&gt; Best,<br>
&gt; Martin<br>
