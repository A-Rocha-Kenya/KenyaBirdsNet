Hi Martin,
That's really good. Once you are back could you also do a write up on
the Little Terns for the East African Rarities Committee and send it
to Nigel Hunter at <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:nigelhunter@timbale.org">&lt;nigelhunter@timbale.org&gt;</a>
Thanks for this and lookingforward to reading further of what you
found up there.
Best for now
Brian

Thanks Brian. I have been keeping a look out for saunders's terns as well
but none so far. The problem is that most of the birds are in non-breeding
plumage. Luckily with the groups I have seen there have been some birds in
breeding plumage.

The other exciting find is a roost of about 1,000 african skimmers. So far
they have been using the site fairly consistently in varying numbers. Other
than that I have been seeing small numbers of species that you would
normally find at the coast such as Terek Sandpiper (1), Whimbrel (2) and
Eurasian Curlew (3)...I also counted over 3,000 Great White Pelicans at
Ferguson's Gulf. I'll send a list around once I am done.
Best,
Martin

Dear Martin,
This record is very exciting, and goes a long way to helping to
understand the presence of Little Tern in East Africa. Your birds
apart from the White-winged Black are all Little, and if you had
eighty like this then that is a great record.
Sweeping comments like.... Saunders Tern also occurs on Lake Turkana
have clouded past records. We now know that Little Terns are the bird
of the lakes, and Saunders is primarily coastal. I had one bird in
breeding plumage at Loyengelani two years ago at this time at dusk. I
have never been convinced that I have seen a Rift Valley Saunders, but
Little on Turkana, Baringo, Naivasha and Nakuru. Records are
increasing in Tanzania as well with small flocks wintering at Speke's
Bay on Lake Victoria. That said, whilst Saunder's inland may be
suspect, Littles do also move along the coast, but they are probably
overlooked for the best part.
What else did you have at Turkana this is a very special time of year
there, and you should have had some other exciting finds,
Best for now
Brian

Hello Birders,
I have attached photos of  what I believe to be a Little Tern
photographed
at Lake Turkana. There was a flock of about 80 of these birds. As can be
seen from the photo, the white of the forehead extends to the rear of the
eye giving a V-like profile unlike the Saunders's tern.

According to the guidebook I'm using (Zimmerman), there only 4 records so
far from the coast and Naivasha. Does anyone have information as to
whether
there have been further sightings and from where they have been
  made?

Best,
Martin
