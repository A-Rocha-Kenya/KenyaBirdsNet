Dear Martin,
This record is very exciting, and goes a long way to helping to
understand the presence of Little Tern in East Africa. Your birds
apart from the White-winged Black are all Little, and if you had
eighty like this then that is a great record.
Sweeping comments like.... Saunders Tern also occurs on Lake Turkana
have clouded past records. We now know that Little Terns are the bird
of the lakes, and Saunders is primarily coastal. I had one bird in
breeding plumage at Loyengelani two years ago at this time at dusk. I
have never been convinced that I have seen a Rift Valley Saunders, but
Little on Turkana, Baringo, Naivasha and Nakuru. Records are
increasing in Tanzania as well with small flocks wintering at Speke's
Bay on Lake Victoria. That said, whilst Saunder's inland may be
suspect, Littles do also move along the coast, but they are probably
overlooked for the best part.
What else did you have at Turkana this is a very special time of year
there, and you should have had some other exciting finds,
Best for now
Brian

Hello Birders,
I have attached photos of  what I believe to be a Little Tern photographed
at Lake Turkana. There was a flock of about 80 of these birds. As can be
seen from the photo, the white of the forehead extends to the rear of the
eye giving a V-like profile unlike the Saunders's tern.

According to the guidebook I'm using (Zimmerman), there only 4 records so
far from the coast and Naivasha. Does anyone have information as to whether
there have been further sightings and from where they have been
 made?

Best,
Martin
