<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" ><tr><td valign="top" style="font: inherit;">Thanks Brian. I have been keeping a look out for saunders's terns as well but none so far. The problem is that most of the birds are in non-breeding plumage. Luckily with the groups I have seen there have been some birds in breeding plumage.<br><br>The other exciting find is a roost of about 1,000 african skimmers. So far they have been using the site fairly consistently in varying numbers. Other than that I have been seeing small numbers of species that you would normally find at the coast such as Terek Sandpiper (1), Whimbrel (2) and Eurasian Curlew (3)...I also counted over 3,000 Great White Pelicans at Ferguson's Gulf. I'll send a list around once I am done.<br>Best,<br>Martin<br><br><br>--- On <b>Tue, 3/5/13, Brian Finch <i>&lt;birdfinch@gmail.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:<br><blockquote style="border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); margin-left: 5px;

Saunders Tern also occurs on Lake Turkana<br>have clouded past records. We now know that Little Terns are the bird<br>of the lakes, and Saunders is primarily coastal. I had one bird in<br>breeding plumage at Loyengelani two years ago at this time at dusk. I<br>have never been convinced that I have seen a Rift Valley Saunders, but<br>Little on
 Turkana, Baringo, Naivasha and Nakuru. Records are<br>increasing in Tanzania as well with small flocks wintering at Speke's<br>Bay on Lake Victoria. That said, whilst Saunder's inland may be<br>suspect, Littles do also move along the coast, but they are probably<br>overlooked for the best part.<br>What else did you have at Turkana this is a very special time of year<br>there, and you should have had some other exciting finds,<br>Best for now<br>Brian<br><br>On 3/5/13, Martin Mwema &lt;<a ymailto="mailto:m_mwema@yahoo.com" href="/mc/compose?to=m_mwema@yahoo.com">m_mwema@yahoo.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; Hello Birders,<br>&gt; I have attached photos of&nbsp; what I believe to be a Little Tern photographed<br>&gt; at Lake Turkana. There was a flock of about 80 of these birds. As can be<br>&gt; seen from the photo, the white of the forehead extends to the rear of the<br>&gt; eye giving a V-like profile unlike the Saunders's tern.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; According to
 the guidebook I'm using (Zimmerman), there only 4 records so<br>&gt; far from the coast and Naivasha.
