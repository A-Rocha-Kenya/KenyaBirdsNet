Dear All,

Please find below the response sent today to My Digital Earth who are
selling Apps of my Bird recordings. I think the issue is self
explanatory.....

For the attention of the Managing Director,
My Digital World.

Re. eBook Birds of East Africa.

Dear Sir,
Immediately on receipt of this communication, I insist that you remove
the eBook Birds of East Africa, from your catalogue and advise as
unavailable until further notice.

I am the sole author of the sounds that you are selling on this eBook,
and as far as I am concerned you have stolen this material and are
publishing my copywritten work illegally.

Bloomsbury have been seriously unprofessional in releasing this
material (that was entrusted to them), to you without any permission
from me, or even any notification whatsoever, to me.

You have been equally unprofessional in making this material available
without any notification to me. There has been no discussion as to the
royalties for the right to sell the property on my behalf, there has
been no discussion as to what the price is that I am asking for this
unique material, there has been no communication whatsoever between
your organisation and myself at any time apart from the initial phone
call when I told you that I could not help you, and you should discuss
the matter with Nigel Redman at Bloomsbury.

I have only learnt of the ready availability of my copywritten
material third hand, and part of what I have heard is that I have not
even received acknowledgement as the sole author of these recordings.
So there is little doubt that the material is as good as pirated.

If I have not heard from you within twenty-four hours, and if the
eBook is not removed from sale in the same period, a copy of this
letter will also be out in the public domain throughout East and
Southern Africa as fast as it takes to send an email.

I think we have to communicate and come to an amicable agreement in
the fastest possible time, so that you will be able to sell the
material legally.

It has taken nearly twenty years of extreme hard work to compile this
collection, and believe me I will do the utmost to protect my
interest, and at present it is certainly not being served.

Yours sincerely

Brian W Finch
