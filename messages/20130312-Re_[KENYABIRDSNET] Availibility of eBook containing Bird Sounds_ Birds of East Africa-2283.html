<FONT FACE="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><SPAN STYLE='font-size:14pt'>A technical question:<BR>
<BR>
Will the app work on a MacBook Pro laptop, or only on iPad and iPhone?<BR>

Dear All,<BR>
A progress report re the sound application. I have had further<BR>
conversations with My Digital World. The General Manager is friendly<BR>
with Safaricoms Group General Manager. They have arranged a special<BR>
line to be opened for a one-off transfer of the working copy of the<BR>
App. I have to go to Safaricom office in Nairobi tomorrow, leave my<BR>
Ipad, and collect it once the transfer is done. There is very high<BR>
security around Apps and I am impressed. Once I have it I can then go<BR>
through and troubleshoot and give it the quality control it has not<BR>
had. Once the product is in order, the amendments will be available as<BR>
a free update to all that have so far purchased the product. Please<BR>
bear with me.<BR>
All other contentious issues are moving ahead favourably, though no<BR>
word at all from Bloomsbury yet.<BR>
Best to all<BR>
Brian<BR>
