Hi all<div><br></div><div>It would be really great to get some nest records for Black Bishop into PHOWN (PHOtos of Weaver Nests, <a href="http://weavers.adu.org.za/phown.php">http://weavers.adu.org.za/phown.php</a>)<div>PHOWN is a Virtual Museum, citizen science project of the Animal Demography Unit, to collect and monitor breeding distributions and colony sizes of weaver birds globally.</div>
<div><br></div><div>If you have a photo of a Black Bishop nest (or any other weaver, for that matter), and you know the date (no matter how long ago) and place, please upload to PHOWN. Upload at <a href="http://vmus.adu.org.za">http://vmus.adu.org.za</a> (you need to register your email first).</div>
<div><br></div><div>The PHOWN database is growing at a steady rate, but lots of weaver species are not represented yet. You can browse species summaries at <a href="http://weavers.adu.org.za/phown_sp.php?Spp=51">http://weavers.adu.org.za/phown_sp.php?Spp=51</a> drop-down list.</div>

      <p>Dear All,<br>
This is a great find and a major extension in known range. Only the<br>
Black Bishops share the combination of black throat and forehead. The<br>
bird is the friederichseni “form” of Black Bishop. I did not know it<br>
extended to the Lake. I have seen it Seronera, Ndutu to Olduvai. What<br>
happens north of there I have no idea, but it sneaks into Kenya in<br>
north Natron and at the now defunct Shompole Lodge, the birds used to<br>
come and drink from the swimming pool which was quite a sight. They<br>
were seasonally common there. I have taken much video, which enables<br>
me to send grabs of the bird in flight. In Kenya from the Lake<br>
Victoria basin westwards we have ansorgei. This extends south to<br>
Rusinga Island, but doesn’t appear to get further south and although<br>
there is habitat it just seems to drop out.<br>
For me the important thing is that I do not believe these two birds<br>
are the same species, or even that closely related. A situation<br>
similar to Usambara Drongo, where things just do not make sense<br>
visually, for birds to be under the same specific umbrella.<br>
Friederichseni whilst it has to feed in grasses like the entire genus,<br>
displays from the tops of acacias and crotons etc. and is a bird of<br>
scrubland. Gierowi only ever exists in some form of grass, be it<br>
native or in gardens of Maize, Sorghum, Sugar Cane etc… but always in<br>
a grass even though it may use adjacent bushes for perching and<br>
singing.<br>
In Stevenson and Fanshawe the illustrations make the two look very<br>
similar, with friederichseni having the red extending a little further<br>
down the back, and gierowi with a tinge of yellow gradation from the<br>
red of the nape. This is not accurate as the attached images will<br>
show. The red continues in friederichseni to the rump, gierowi only<br>
has colour to the extreme of the upper back but the hind collar is<br>
bright yellow.<br>
Best to all<br>
Brian<br>
