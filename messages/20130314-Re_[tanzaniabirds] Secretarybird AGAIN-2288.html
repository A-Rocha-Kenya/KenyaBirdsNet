Dear All,
This is a bit of a sweeping statement, but I think in Kenya we are not
seeing a reduction in numbers and the species is still widespread.
Nairobi Park for instance has three breeding pairs one of which
fledged two young this week.  That said, I think there is no reason
for complacency, and whilst we do have a reasonable population we
should record all individuals, if there is a downtrend, we can monitor
from the start. Lets hope we never see that decline.
Best to all
Brian

HI

In northern Tanzania, I wouldn’t consider food supply a problem, you see
adults even on the outskirts of Arusha. I would imagine that outside of
protected areas one of the main problems is the vulnerability of the
nests
to people, mainly kids and possibly Pied Crows which continue to increase
and in our area mob everything!

many of you will recall that some of us put a hurried note together for
CITES on the plight of this bird a year or so ago.

following on from this Sally Hofmeyr is writing up what we know for
official publication.

we are asking ALL of YOU to

A. provide any undocumented records hidden in your note books.
B. thoughts, even anecdotal ones, on the situation in an area you are
familiar with.
C. where it no longer occurs but there are historical records ...WHY
might
it have disappeared ?

between us we have all the literature but any personal perspective would
be very much appreciated.

please write to your group so others see your comments as these often
trigger memories and at least nudge others to reply.

please cc your msg to Sally at <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:salhofmeyr@gmail.com">&lt;salhofmeyr@gmail.com&gt;</a>;

many thanks
