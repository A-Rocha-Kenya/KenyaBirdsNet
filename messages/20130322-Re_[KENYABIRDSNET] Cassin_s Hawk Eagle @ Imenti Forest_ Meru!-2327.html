Hi Titus,
Raptors are a very difficult group at any time, but in this instance
look at the feet, and compare them to any Accipiter and I am sure you
will change your thoughts,
Best for now
Brian

Dear Peter,

Thanks for this great shot.This looks like an immature accipiter  Looking at
the last picture to the left, long tail, spotted under tail coverts on the
1st and the 2nd picture, the dark mustache on the throat, suggest it should
be Norther Goshawk.

Regards,

Titus

      Dear All,
On a our way back 28 Feb 2013 from Meru National Park on a
productive raptor survey with the Raptor Working Group of Nature Kenya, we
decided to make a brief stopover at Imenti forest to look for some
interesting
birds that we might see. On a quick glance at the forest from the roadside
we
sighted a young brown raptor with some heavy streakings on the belly
against
the rufous breast  perched on the canopy.
We did not have a consensus pertaining to its real ID and so we decided to
take
a photo of it and share it with other raptor ‘fundis’. It was with great
excitement when Simon Thomset and Rob Davies confirmed to us that it was a
juv.
Cassin`s Hawk Eagle(attached above),which is extremely rare here! It`s
primarily a Central and West African forest raptor which unfortunatey does
not
appear in our Kenya fieldguides. However regional guides show its eastern
most
reach as the forest of extreme western Uganda . Its first documented
sighting is a specimen that was collected in Mt.Elgon in 1926. Its second
sighting
was in 2006 by Brian Finch. Have a look at the photo and share your opinion
with us.

Other observers included Darcy Ogada,Ben Mugambi and Shiv
Kapila.

Thanks to the Peregrine Fund for sponsoring the trip and
Ben`s Ecological Safaris for the logistical support.



Best regards,



Wairasho Peter
