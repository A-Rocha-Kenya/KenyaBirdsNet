OBSERVATIONS OF THE SELEMPO SPARROW AT SALA GATE,
TSAVO EAST NATIONAL PARK.


A year ago, Edwin Selempo was at Sala Gate with some clients, and when
looking through the House Sparrows present, noticed something very
different. There were House Sparrows, in amongst the House Sparrows
that had entirely rich chestnut-brown heads.
In January this year he showed them to David Fisher, they were still
in the same location and David managed a few images. These images were
then circulated to a few people for comment, and all agreed that there
was something very interesting about the Selempo Sparrow.
On the coast of Somalia, but in the northern hemisphere is the
nominate race of Somali Sparrow, unlike our colourful yellowish race
fulgens, these birds lack the yellow and instead show white cheeks and
no yellow on the underparts.
The conclusion amongst the few that were asked to comment was that
these were for the best part the first nominate Somali Sparrow for
East Africa, maybe unfairly it was mooted that they might be hybrid.

On 23rd March, Mike Davidson, Nigel Hunter and myself were heading off
to the coast for a few days, and were staying that night and the
return night in Satao Camp in the eastern part of Tsavo East. We
wanted to get some information on the birds as we passed through. They
were not at the entrance gate, but at the Artefact Duka only fifty
metres away. Here they fed on the ground with normal House Sparrows,
and the staff fed the birds and also provided a bird bath. They looked
content with their lot! We estimated that there were five male Selempo
Sparrows, and did not know what the females looked like or if they
would be separable from female House Sparrow. (One of the images with
a male shows a female with unmarked shoulders, that may be it).

We studied the birds, took images and video, and on the return journey
were able to show them to Fleur Ng’Weno. We made a very good contact
with a KWS fellow at the gate, who was most interested and wanted to
assist in trapping the birds for blood specimens. These details have
been sent to Colin Jackson who will handle the project. It will be
interesting to see how the dna also compares with their House Sparrow
friends, to see if there has been some dilution.

We looked carefully at the birds, and could not see any sign that they
were hybridising.
The males showed all chestnut heads, very bright white cheeks unlike
the dirty white of House Sparrow, the entire underparts instead of
being the dirty white of House Sparrow were an attractive soft grey.
We thought it better to call them Selempo Sparrow as Edwin deserves
all the credit for bringing attention to them, until we can confirm
that they are Somali Sparrow of the nominate race, which I personally
feel they are.

How nominate Somali Sparrow males differ from House Sparrow males.

S has entirely chestnut top to head continuous to base of bill.
H has entirely grey top to head from base of bill, chestnut only on
sides of head.

S adults show extensive black breast patch with scalloping down to breast.
H usually has more confined patch, most lacking scalloped effect.

S has pure white cheek patch sharply contrasting with soft grey underparts.
H has white cheeks and grey tinged underparts, but not contrasting.

S has no conspicuous white band across carpal.
H invariably shows obvious white band across carpal.

S has entirely rich rufous secondary coverts.
H shows the edges of  the secondary coverts rufous brown, most of
inner edge of feather black.

S has pale grey back with silvery grey and black streaks.
H shows rufous-brown back with cream and blackish streaking.

S Show rufous edging to primaries
H show creamy-brown edges to primaries.

The Selempo Sparrows at Sala Gate show every one of these nominate
castanopterus characters. There is no indication of these appearing in
the House Sparrows, but no two House Sparrows are alike, they are
always so highly variable.

Whilst dna testing will tell, I cannot see how they could ever be
freakish House Sparrows or hybrids with some other Kenyan Sparrow.

Now we come to the question of provenance. I have no explanation.
In Somalia this form occurs along the coast as far south as 1o North
but not even reaching Mogadishu (as far as is known).  Could it have
come as ship assisted, landed in Malindi as multiple individuals,
which seems so unlikely, then followed the road to Tsavo East.
Could there be little populations scattered in the bush that has
allowed for again multiple birds to arrive at Sala Gate. Is it
possible that they are out there and no-one has noticed them until
Edwin found them?

I would imagine that these questions won’t ever be answered, but there
is no denying that they are there.

Best to all,
Brian
