Hi Shailesh,
I think this bird is in very advanced breeding plumage, but I can't
recall seeing such yellow legs on a Greenshank before, and artists in
literature are showing the birds with green legs in breeding plumage.
Where did you git your reference that yellow legs are normal?
Best for now
Brian

Hello,
Thank you Brian for that yellow-legged Greenshank image that you took in
Tsavo East NP, in between Satao and Aruba Dam. I was reading in the
encyclopedia of european birds in which it tells that Greenshank legs are
yellowish in summer.

So do you think that the Greenshank is now in summer plumage and ready to
migrant to europe?
Regards,
Shailesh

Dear All,
Just completing processing the last of the images taken on the recent
week trip to the coast. One more bird of interest in Tsavo East NP, in
between Satao and Aruba Dam was this yellow-legged Greenshank, which
must be at the upper end of the scale for yellow legs in this species.
Best to all
Brian
