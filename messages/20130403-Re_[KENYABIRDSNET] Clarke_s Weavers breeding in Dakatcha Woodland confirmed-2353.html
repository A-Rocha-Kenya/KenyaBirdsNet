Dakatcha Woodland Conservation Group and Nature Kenya are happy to report
that Clarkeâ€™s Weavers are breeding in Dakatcha Woodland Important Bird
Area in March 2013.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The breeding grounds of this endemic and endangered bird have been a
mystery for many years. David Ngala and Don Turner saw adults feeding
flying young in Dakatcha Woodland in 1994, but the actual nesting site
had never been found. Nature Kenya has had a project to monitor the
weavers and raise community awareness in Dakatcha Woodland IBA since
2005, and I have visited Dakatcha Woodland with the local team regularly
since 2007. When Martin Odino found Weynsâ€™ Weaver in Kenya, we learned
that this Ugandan bird foraged in forest but nested in swamps. Since then
we have searched the wetlands of Dakatcha Woodland as well as the
Brachystegia woodland.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
On 6 January the team found a flock of Clarkeâ€™s Weavers in a seasonal
wetland of grass and sedge, but we could not see them either building or
feeding. Smaller monitoring teams found the weavers in the same wetland
in late January to early February and again in early March. Not wanting
to disturb the birds, we did not venture into the wetland.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Then on 22 March a team composed of Jonathan Mwachongo, Patrick Changawa,
Julius Mwambire, Japhet Garama, Kazungu Thuva, Samuel Kenga, Samson
Katisho, Peter Wario and myself, Fleur Ngâ€™weno, visited the area again.
There had been some showers of rain, and all the Brachystegia trees were
vibrantly green and in flower. At the wetland, however, our hearts sank;
the sedges had been cut for thatch. We collected a few empty nests on the
ground to take to the National Museums of Kenya.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The next day, 23 March 2013, we visited another seasonal wetland fairly
far away, and found a flock of Clarkeâ€™s Weavers flying in and out of
the wetland. Perhaps we had found another site! Our hopes were
re-kindled. (The next day, however, the weavers had left, and we noticed
that there was no water where the sedges were growing.)<br>
&nbsp;<br>
On the way back to the campsite, we passed a seasonal wetland where we
had stopped several times in other years. Should we check it again? Of
course! And we found a large flock of Clarkeâ€™s Weavers in the
sedges.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We observed the Clarkeâ€™s Weavers carefully from the shade of trees
bordering the wetland. There were several hundred, males and females,
actively flying back and forth across the wetland. Some males seemed to
be displaying, others just perching on the sedges. They were making their
buzzing, sizzling calls. Then we saw the brownish, rounded shapes of
nests. A few males flew in, carrying strips of building materials. One
male was seen weaving more sedge strips onto a nest. This was it! The
breeding site.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The next morning we arrived at 6:10 am and found the Clarkeâ€™s Weavers
already active, flying back and forth within the wetland and singing.
Frogs and toads were also calling. Then flocks of 60 to 100 birds began
to lift up from the wetland and fly up and away. We presumed they went to
feed in the forest. Seven flocks flew off in the next half hour, giving
us an estimate of about 550 birds. Many weavers could still be seen in
the wetland. We estimated the group to be about 700 birds – perhaps as
many as one thousand. We took phhotos and a video.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
A few men, women and children from nearby homesteads came to the wetland
to collect water. They were at the far end of the wetland from the weaver
site and did not seem to disturb the birds.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
On 26 March, we were joined by Mike Davidson, George Odera and Brian
Finch from Nature Kenya and Colin Jackson and Silas from A Rocha. They
brought telescopes for better viewing and took photos. The weavers were
still active, but less busy building; many of them sitting on top of the
nests. Brian Finch estimated some five hundred nests concentrated in the
small area of sedges within the grassland.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The breeding of Clarkeâ€™s Weavers in Dakatcha Woodland is thus
confirmed.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Dakatcha Woodland Conservation Group, with support from Nature Kenya, is
taking active steps to protect this first known breeding site.
Representatives will visit the area later this week to talk to the local
elders. They will also inform the representatives of the government in
the area. We hope that once the people living near the wetland realize
the importance of these birds â€“ found only in Kilifi County and nowhere
else in the world – they will takke steps to see the wetland is not
disturbed.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This finding will be published in greater detail, and with photos,
later.<br>
