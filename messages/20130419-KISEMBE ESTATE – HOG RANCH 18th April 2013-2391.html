KISEMBE ESTATE – HOG RANCH 18th April 2013

It’s getting late for migrants, but Rupert Watson and myself spent an
enjoyable four hours on Hog Ranch and a short time in his garden, on
Kisembe Estate.

In that time we recorded 89 species, with some common species just not
showing themselves.

Highlights were a Great Egret flying over, Long-crested Eagle, Lanner,
four separate territories of Emerald Cuckoo are on the estate, we also
had Klaas’ and Diederik, a single Mottled Swift,  the biggest
highlight in both senses of the word were a pair of Silvery-cheeked
Hornbills… a species not yet recorded in Nairobi National Park.
Although others have seen them on the Estate, this was a personal
first for me, a small movement of Barn Swallows, Rupert had a probable
Great Reed Warbler, but we lost it, three Red-backed and one Lesser
Grey Shrike.
