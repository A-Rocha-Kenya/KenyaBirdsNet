First thought nominate <i>Anthus hodgsoni </i>Olive-backed Pipit. But perhaps it is too heavily streaked above.<br><br>Clive Mann<br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On 28 April 2013 15:02, Brian Finch <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:birdfinch@gmail.com" target="_blank">birdfinch@gmail.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>

      <p>Dear All,<br>
<br>
On 20th April I was at Champagne Ridge Corner, Ngong Hills with Simon<br>
Ball, Nigel Hunter and Mike Davidson. We had stopped to see if there<br>
were any migrants using the valley, and had soon found a palearctic<br>
Red-rumped Swallow amongst Barn and emini Red-rumped Swallows. If<br>
accepted this will be only the second record of this race in East<br>
Africa. Whilst we were watching this bird and trying very<br>
unsuccessfully to get images of it, there was a Tree Pipit in a nearby<br>
bush which looked quite normal, and in a neighbouring bush a little<br>
further away was another Tree Pipit, except it was green! I took an<br>
image of this bird  with an idea of returning to it later, but we were<br>
still trying to get evidence on the rufula Red-rumped Swallow and in<br>
the meantime the pipit flew off!<br>
I have sent the image out to a few people and had some interesting<br>
feedback, and now spreading the net wider for arguments as to what the<br>
bird might be.<br>
Image attached, the ordinary Tree Pipit on the left, and the green<br>
Tree Pipit on the right.<br>
Best for now<br>
Brian<br>
