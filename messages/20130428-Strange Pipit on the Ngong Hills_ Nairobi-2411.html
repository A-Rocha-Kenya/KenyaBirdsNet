Dear All,

On 20th April I was at Champagne Ridge Corner, Ngong Hills with Simon
Ball, Nigel Hunter and Mike Davidson. We had stopped to see if there
were any migrants using the valley, and had soon found a palearctic
Red-rumped Swallow amongst Barn and emini Red-rumped Swallows. If
accepted this will be only the second record of this race in East
Africa. Whilst we were watching this bird and trying very
unsuccessfully to get images of it, there was a Tree Pipit in a nearby
bush which looked quite normal, and in a neighbouring bush a little
further away was another Tree Pipit, except it was green! I took an
image of this bird  with an idea of returning to it later, but we were
still trying to get evidence on the rufula Red-rumped Swallow and in
the meantime the pipit flew off!
I have sent the image out to a few people and had some interesting
feedback, and now spreading the net wider for arguments as to what the
bird might be.
Image attached, the ordinary Tree Pipit on the left, and the green
Tree Pipit on the right.
Best for now
Brian
