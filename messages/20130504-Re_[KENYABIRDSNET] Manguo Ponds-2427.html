Dear All,
I am afraid I can only echo Adams recommendation. He should consult
the internet and read the innumerable reports available. Maybe also he
should contact Nature Kenya for the contacts for local guides in the
best birding places. If he is not willing to pay the charge for  a
local guide, then the value of his Kenya Birding experience will fall
exponentially. Very strange that he should write to Paula.
Best for now
Brian

Hi Paula,

My best advice is for Mr Rockey is to use local guides at these sites at
every opportunity.

Unfortunately, I'm heading out of the door just now before a busy few days
but I'm sure that other members of the group will be very happy to
contribute contact details for local guides for each of these great birding
locations.

Best of luck with it all,

Adam

Dear all,

I just got this email and have to admit total ignorance on some of his
questions regarding birds he wants to see ... and thought you'd all be
better able to respond to William with advice/tips on his upcoming
safari?

Cheers
Paula



Hello,

Jeff Lincer told me you might have some advice for our planned trip to
Kenya
and Uganda this summer. Without hiring a long-term guide, my wife and I
will be traveling to Naivasha, Baringo, Kakamega, Bwindi, Kibale,
Budongo,
and Watamu by public transport. We plan on renting a car to visit the 3
Samburu reserves, the Masai Mara, and as an intro Lake Magadi and Nairobi
NP. As for lodging, we plan on camping the majority of the time.

Any suggestions for our DIY safari? Do you have any recommendations for
locating endemics like Sharpe's Longclaw, Williams's Lark, or Clarke's
Weaver?

Any advice is greatly appreciated. We're really excited to bird east
Africa!

Cheers,
-William Rockey

May Day greetings

The holiday was a good opportunity for Nature Kenya's Wednesday morning
birdwalk to drive up to Manguo Pond in Limuru. The water was expansive,
and
although migrants had left, there were many birds.

Highlights included:
Maccoa Duck (at least one male)
About 60 White-backed Ducks, including small ducklings
Fulvous Whistling Ducks allowing close approach
More than 12 Purple Swamphen, with brown juveniles and larger immatures
Red-knobbed Coots nesting (and large juveniles)
African Jacana with young
Whiskered Terns apparently nesting

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
