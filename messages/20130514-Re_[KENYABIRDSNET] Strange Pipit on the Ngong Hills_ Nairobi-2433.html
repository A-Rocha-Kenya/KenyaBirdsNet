Brian,<br><br>When I first became seriously interested in birds in 1950s there were birds that could not be identified - they were called &#39;hoodwinks&#39;. However, hubris has ruled, and we expect to be able to identify everything. Your pipit is a reminder that hoodwinks still exist.<br>

      <p>Dear All,<br>
<br>
Many, many thanks to all those who contributed to find an identity for<br>
the strange green Tree Pipit seen on the Ngong Hills, alongside a<br>
normal Tree Pipit.<br>
<br>
I have attached the thread of correspondence showing peoples arguments<br>
for and against the identity of the bird being an Olive-backed Pipit<br>
or Tree Pipit.<br>
<br>
It makes for a very interesting and educational read, and the final<br>
conclusion is that this was a very, very strange bird, and specific<br>
identity will always be a mystery.<br>
<br>
What I have personally learnt is; if there are two rarities around at<br>
the same time, make sure each receives fair attention! A green Tree<br>
Pipit might be just a green Tree Pipit. Not everything seen can be<br>
labelled (certainly something that I have already learnt from not<br>
being able to identify many Aquila Eagles).  All Tree Pipits in future<br>
will require more than a casual glance. Olive-backed Pipit is not an<br>
impossibility to appear in East Africa one day. That there are<br>
instances of wild hybridisation of Pipits, including three involving<br>
Tree Pipits (see attached details). That Killian’s method of colour<br>
sampling on the computer using the photo programmes eye-dropper tool<br>
is a brilliant idea, (providing the images were taken with identical<br>
settings etc). Finally I really don’t want to see an identical bird to<br>
this one again!<br>
<br>
Again many thanks for this educative trail,<br>
Brian<br>
