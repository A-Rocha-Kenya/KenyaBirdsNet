Hi Matt,
You are completely right, which is why I qualified conditions after
saying it was a good idea. You have to remove hundreds of variables to
justify the eye-dropper testing method, however if you have a bird in
the field that is part of a group, you should be able to compare
colour points on those individuals providing it is a high quality
image, and it was something I had never considered before.
Best for now
Brian

Rosemary,

Most species of bird show very little (almost none to our eyes) variation
except for age/sex/breeding plumage/wear, or geographical variation which
may be distinguished as a separate subspecies. A small number e.g. many *
Buteo*/<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Pernis<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, do show considerable individual variation. There is also
the problem of abnormalities such as albinism, leucism etc. etc.
When an individual such as Brian's pipit shows a plumage variation that is
outside the above then birders get 'fussed'.

As a new birder and an old geneticist, may I enquire why birders get so
fussed about genetic variation within species?

Brian,

When I first became seriously interested in birds in 1950s there were
birds that could not be identified - they were called 'hoodwinks'.
However,
hubris has ruled, and we expect to be able to identify everything. Your
pipit is a reminder that hoodwinks still exist.

Dear All,

Many, many thanks to all those who contributed to find an identity for
the strange green Tree Pipit seen on the Ngong Hills, alongside a
normal Tree Pipit.

I have attached the thread of correspondence showing peoples arguments
for and against the identity of the bird being an Olive-backed Pipit
or Tree Pipit.

It makes for a very interesting and educational read, and the final
conclusion is that this was a very, very strange bird, and specific
identity will always be a mystery.

What I have personally learnt is; if there are two rarities around at
the same time, make sure each receives fair attention! A green Tree
Pipit might be just a green Tree Pipit. Not everything seen can be
labelled (certainly something that I have already learnt from not
being able to identify many Aquila Eagles). All Tree Pipits in future
will require more than a casual glance. Olive-backed Pipit is not an
impossibility to appear in East Africa one day. That there are
instances of wild hybridisation of Pipits, including three involving
Tree Pipits (see attached details). That Killian’s method of colour
sampling on the computer using the photo programmes eye-dropper tool
is a brilliant idea, (providing the images were taken with identical
settings etc). Finally I really don’t want to see an identical bird to
this one again!

Again many thanks for this educative trail,
Brian
