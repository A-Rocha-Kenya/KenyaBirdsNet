    A Rocha Kenya is running a ringing training course at the end of
    this month and we have had some cancellations meaning there will be
    c.2 more spaces for anyone else who is interested in joining the
    course.<br>
    <br>
    It will be a 2-week course the dates being 27th May to June 7th.
    Anyone who is interested in doing this course should write to Andrew
    on <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E"
      href="mailto:andrew.kinzer@arocha.org">&lt;andrew.kinzer@arocha.org&gt;</a>
    for further details. It will be a residential course at the A Rocha
    Kenya centre in Watamu and will cover all the basics of ringing
    birds: putting up nets, extracting birds, identification, ringing
    the bird, ageing, taking biometrics and general care of birds in the
    hand together with more detailed input on ageing and moult. <br>
    <br>
    Those who participate will receive a certificate - but note this
    will <i>not</i> be a ringing permit. However the course will set
    you up with a firm foundation of ringing skills to build on. <br>
    <br>
    Applicants should be familiar with the identification in the field
    of commoner bird species and and ideally have handled at least 50
    birds already. In fact anyone who is already a ringer will probably
    benefit the most from this as opposed to someone new as we will have
    the chance to discuss in detail the more tricky components of bird
    ringing.<br>
    <br>
    The Afrotropical migrants are all back so the bushes are alive with
    Red-capped Robin Chats mimicking Crowned Eagles and Emerald Cuckoos,
    and there are flashes of blue as Pygmy Kingfisher shoot off through
    the forest. A great time of the year - and good to be ringing!<br>
