<div class="moz-text-flowed">Dear Ringers
<br>
<br>A few weeks ago I submitted a request for data on swallows, martins and
<br>swifts ringed in South Africa (message copied below). Thank you very
<br>much to all the people who responded and are allowing me to use their
<br>data. Every sample makes a contribution. The project is going so well
<br>that I have decided to expand it to looking at the variation in size of
<br>swallows, martins and swifts ringed anywhere in sub-Saharan Africa and 
associated islands.
<br>Please, if you are willing to allow me to use your data please e-mail it
<br>to me <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:stevenwe@vodamail.co.za">stevenwe@vodamail.co.za</a> or fax it to me on 086 556 3099.
<br>
<br>Kind regards

<br>Dear Ringers,
<br>
<br>I am busy with research into the variation in sizes of swallows, martins
<br>and swifts throughout their range in South Africa. If you are willing to
<br>share your data with me you will be acknowledged in any publications
<br>produced using the data. If you are willing to provide me with digital
<br>data please could you e-mail it to me <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:stevenwe@vodamail.co.za">stevenwe@vodamail.co.za</a> or
<br>analog (paper) data either post photocopies to me at the address given
<br>below or fax it to me on 086 556 3099. For the swallows, martins and
<br>swifts I would be happy to receive all the data you collect when ringing
<br>and not just the data you submit to SAFRING. In addition, if you have
<br>exact coordinates of the places you have ringed the swallows, martins or
<br>swifts at please provide these, if not then the degrees-minutes you
<br>submit to SAFRING will do.
<br>
<br>Kind regards
<br>
<br>Steven
