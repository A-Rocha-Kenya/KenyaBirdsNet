MAGADI ROAD 26th May 2013

Dear All,

On 26th May, Rupert Watson and myself decided it would be a nice day
for visiting the Magadi Road, and whilst the birding was exceptional,
there were two non-bird highlights, so I thought we would get these
out of the way first.

Just above the Ol Kejo bridge (still passable with some shoring on the
western side), we stumbled across an orchid. But this was an orchid
the likes of which I had never seen before. The flowers were very
bizarre and spectacular, and the flowering stem grew like a fountain
from a green pool which were the large round basal leaves that clung
to the ground. Using the Upland Flowers book, I was easily able to key
the plant out to Habenaria helicoplectrum. I cannot recommend this
book more highly for anyone with the love of the great outdoors, what
I did find strange whilst doing the investigation was that although a
guide, there is no attempt to give some indication of a species
relative abundance which should have been easily enough to use words
like common, rare, widespread, local etc., and in the explanation to
the abbreviations used to denote geographic distribution, the list is
strangely in no alphabetical order, and it requires going through the
whole section to find the abbreviation you are looking for.
Nevertheless what an incredible and not so inexpensive (for the
information contained) masterpiece.
I checked in Blundell for the plant, and it didn’t get a mention, and
so I tried the internet, and whilst many Habenaria are available,
there is nothing on this plant other than it’s name appearing on plant
species lists and a specimen in Kew.
So here attached is an image of the flowers for all their bizarreness
to be appreciated!

With all the greenery down the road, it is not surprising for the
first time in many years we are seeing the potential of a good
butterfly season coming up for June or July. There are a number of
nice species out now, and amongst them a photographed a “blue” that I
recognised as a Tarucus, but on getting back home and checking the
illustration in Larsen, it appears to be Tarucus theophrastus, the
only problem is, is that it is only listed from a few specimens from
Kacheliba! More investigation required it would seem. Any other
butterfly fundies out there that want to lend a hand please feel free.

Now the birds….

We started off at Corner Baridi and it was a bit, the Rift was light
cloud but clearing quite rapidly. There was little on the escarpment,
but a pair of Lyne’s Cisticolas were carrying insects to some
concealed young. There were a couple of Golden-winged Sunbirds as
well, but it was really quiet otherwise.
Our next stop was the place where we found the orchid, and the reason
being was that a Zanzibar Sombre Greenbul was singing from the side of
the road, so we had a short walk. The Greenbul was an extravert
singing from the very tops of bushes. This is my second along the road
itself, a previous being at the Icross turn-off. I would imagine that
this is the only place anywhere, where this species is actually in the
Great Rift Valley. Also here were a pair of White-headed Sawwings,
strange to see these two species together on this road. The birding
was extremely good and it had warmed to a pleasant morning and there
was much activity. A pair of African Hawk-Eagles were additionally
here, plus a stunning Paradise Whydah and Grey-headed Silverbill.

On the other side of the Ol Kejo many Ashy Cisticolas had broods, and
Rosy-patched Bush-shrikes called from the bush tops. At the 60km to
Magadi sign, where there is usually a pair of the special Ngong
Pringles Puffbacks they were not to be found, but we entered the dense
mainly Acacia mellifera dominated scrub and found active
Mouse-coloured Penduline-Tit, Tiny Cisticolas and Somali Buntings, and
flushed a Nightjar which by chance Rupert was able to pinpoint where
it had landed. This enabled the bird to be photographed and videoed
but is quite obviously a Dusky. Whilst a common bird around Nairobi, I
usually associate it as a grassland with scattered bushes species,
here it was just in dense scrub and a long way from the nearest open
area.  (Image attached).

Wherever we stopped we were seeing nice birds, shortly before the
Camel Road we found a mobbing party and in the middle of them was a
Spotted Eagle-Owl. Many birds were nesting, and there was a lot of
vocal activity. But with all this breeding, where on earth were the
Great Spotted, Jacobin, Levaillant’s, Black and African Cuckoos that
should have been here? Our only cuckoos were the less transitory
Red-chested, Diederick and Klaas’.

Before Ol Tepesi there was some breeding activity at the small dam,
the Lesser Masked Weavers appeared to be finished, but the Chestnut
Sparrows were still in the social-weavers nests. There was a noisy
Swahili Sparrow here at the northernmost outpost of its range. There
were many birds coming in to drink and parties of Red-billed Queleas
were actually singing in the scrub. (Not a species we hear often in
Kenya). A spectacular mixed swift party came in and drank just thirty
feet away, they consisted of Horus, Little, African Black and Mottled
(and we had seen Nyanza further up the road).</pre></div></body>
