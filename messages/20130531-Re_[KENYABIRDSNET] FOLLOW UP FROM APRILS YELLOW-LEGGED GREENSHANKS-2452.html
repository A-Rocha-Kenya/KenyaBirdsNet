<div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;;font-size:medium">I think some care is needed here - yellow and green are in the same area of the colour spectrum, and I believe that the Greenshank&#39;s legs have always been on the yellow side of green. A Google image search for Greenshank brings up a lot of images that one would describe as yellow-shanked rather than green-shanked - some of them quite strikingly so. </div>
<div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;;font-size:medium"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;;font-size:medium">Could this be natural variation, in the yellow to yellowish-green area of the spectrum? And it&#39;s hard also to eliminate observer bias - if you&#39;re looking at a bird called &quot;Greenshank&quot;, then you expect the legs to be green and don&#39;t give it much thought, unless someone happens to say, &quot;Hey those legs are yellow!&quot;</div>

      <p>Dear All,<br>
A follow up on the Yellow-legged Greenshank in Tsavo East in April,<br>
then another photographed at Bungoma, I wrote to South Africa,<br>
enquiring if they ever had ever found yellow-legged Greenshanks. It<br>
appeared that no-one had heard of such a thing. Adam Riley wrote to<br>
Hugh Chittenden, who said he had seen and photographed them twice. One<br>
in Kruger, and the other in Okavango. We now have four images of<br>
different birds, the interesting thing is, is that between the four<br>
photographs they seem to cover plumages from breeding to winter<br>
plumage. This strongly suggests that the leg-colour is not a result of<br>
breeding condition, but there might be Greenshanks out there that<br>
always have yellow legs. Maybe even a population!<br>
In the new RSA field-guide, they are now going to illustrate it!<br>
Best for now<br>
Brian<br>
