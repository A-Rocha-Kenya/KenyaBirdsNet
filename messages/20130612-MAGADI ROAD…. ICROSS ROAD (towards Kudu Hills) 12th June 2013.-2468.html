MAGADI ROAD…. ICROSS ROAD (towards Kudu Hills) 12th June 2013.

Dear All,
Adam Kennedy and myself met at Rupert Watson’s house at 6.30am on the
overcast, nunu-ing and cool morning of 12th June. Our intention being
to get out of the premature July-type gloom that has struck Nairobi.
We headed off down the Magadi Road, and after passing Corner Baridi,
things got far more pleasant, warmer and brighter although the sun did
not really make an emergence until about 10.00am.

We birded a little down the steep hill after Olepolos club, where
there was a nice patch of Leonotis that was attracting some hungry and
quite indifferent Bronze, Golden-winged, Beautiful, Scarlet-chested,
Marico and Variable Sunbirds. The Maricos glistened in colours that
had to be seen to be believed.

Then the remainder of the day was spent just birding along twenty
kilometres of the Icross Road as far as the dam to the right of the
road, getting close to the base of the vocanic plug-like hill of
Oldonyo Narok.

What a spectacularly birdy piece this turned out to be. All green and
lush, but nearly all fenced. However so much of the habitat was in
good stead behind the fences, and the birds could be seen from the
roadside. A few areas were unfenced that permitted walking around.

I have attached a list at the end of all the species that we recorded
along this road, and here just detailing the highlights.

Our first interesting find was right at the junction, where there was
a Bush Pipit singing its scratchy simple refrain from the top of an
isolated acacia. Then not too far up the road, we had a pair of
Short-tailed Larks right by the car. In beautiful crisp plumage one
bird (presumed male) was hammering at the ground, characteristically
digging holes in the whitish dusty soil at its feet, and successfully
finding titbits, whilst its mate was grabbing hold of beakfulls of
vegetation, (presumed female), and when she had a load, she flew off
and went to the other side of the road where there was rank grass and
bush, immediately followed by the male. Another local breeding record
after the nest at Olorgessailie a couple of months ago.
Continuing on a few more kilometres we were trying to locate the local
kiwanukae dark race of Black-faced Waxbill for Adam who had not seen
the species in Kenya. We were very successful, and seemed to encounter
them the rest of the day as well. Whilst here a Pringle’s Puffback
called, and we had very nice views of a foraging male. This of course
was the still undescribed silver-backed Ngong endemic, and not the
normal black-backed form.

We finally arrived at the little dam, fully enclosed with vegetation
all round including sedges growing around the rim and plenty of trees.
Although this habitat looked incredible for attracting something out
of the ordinary, apart from nesting Lesser Masked Weavers, there was
little else of note.

On the return we found three Two-banded Coursers, always nice to see.

We turned back from here at 3.30pm, birding slowly back to the Magadi
Road Junction, and having little problem with the traffic in Ongata
Rongai were back home around 6.00pm finding that the weather had
remained cold and gloomy and the power went down at 5.00pm, and as at
now as I write at 9.00am, no sign of it returning!
