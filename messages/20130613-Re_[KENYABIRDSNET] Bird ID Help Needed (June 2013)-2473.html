Dear Richard,
Thanks for sharing this with us. All of your photos are as you say
they are, Common Redshank, rare enough but what an incredible date,
Swamp Nightjar, you cannot mistake the extensive black cheeks, and of
course all white outer-tail feathers, Blue-breasted Bee-eater... where
exactly were they in Mumias? In that area they have never been seen
away from Nambale and with an immature too!
Great records here,
Best for now
Brian

Dear All,



I have currently been birding around the country with some friends and have
a few sightings that I would like to share and confirm with you all. Your
help would be greatly appreciated and I would welcome any and all comments.




On June the 2nd we found what we presume to be a Common Redshank at Lake
Nakuru National Park. Please find attached a picture of this bird. From the
field guide this bird is not common inland and certainly should not be here
in June. From the photo can anyone confirm that this is indeed a Common
Redshank?



On the 5th of June my friends and I ventured into the Kerio valley and we
were fortunate to find a Gambaga Flycatcher, two Chestnut-crowned
Sparrow-weavers and a Stripe-breasted Seedeater all in the same tree. While
we were watching these birds Boran Cistciola and White-crested Turaco's
were
calling in the valley below. For those of you that have not traveled to
this
part of the country it is spectacular and the birds are fantastic.



On the 6th of June we were in Kakamega Forest. Highlights were two
sightings
of African Shrike Flycatchers, an African Broadbill, and an unusually
obliging Black-billed Turaco that posed for a few shots. Please find one
attached.



The 7th of June was spent near Busia and Mumias. We unfortunately broke
down
in Mumias and spent three hours in sugar cane fields searching for any
birds
we could find. We happened across a few Bee-eaters that I'm guessing are
Blue-breasted Bee-eaters. Please find attached two images of these birds.
They were working the edge of the sugar cane fields and a marshy area
nearby. With the recent discussion on this forum surrounding Blue-breasted
Bee-eaters can anyone either confirm or refute my identification. I have
never seen this species in Kenya before and would love some feedback.



On the 10th of June we were driving between Talek and Keekerok in the Mara
Reserve. We were watching a Coqui Francolin walk down the road and into the
grass when suddenly a nightjar was flushed by the francolin. It landed on
the road and then scuttled into the grass. The brief look I had at the bird
grabbed my attention and we drove down the road towards where the bird
disappeared with cameras ready. It flushed as we drove by and we were able
to snap some shots of it before it dove back into the grass. Can anyone
confirm from the images attached that this is indeed a Swamp Nightjar. I
have never seen this species before and from the range map it appears to be
very rare in the Mara.



Other interesting sightings from the trip that you all might find
interesting were a brief encounter with a Brush-tailed Porcupine in
daylight
in Kakamega. A Forest Night Adder in Kakamega swallowing a frog on the
trail
and 4 African Wild Dogs hunting on the road between Lemek and Aitong.



Take Care everyone and I appreciate all help with identification in
advance.



Regards,



Stratton Hatfield
