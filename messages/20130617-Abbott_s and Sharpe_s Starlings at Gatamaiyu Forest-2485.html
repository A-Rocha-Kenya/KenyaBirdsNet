<BR>
Unseasonal rain in Nairobi (loudly predicted by a Red-chested Cuckoo on Wednesday) made Nature Kenya's Sunday Birdwatch participants hesitate about our choice of destination, but a phone call by Peter Wairasho informed us it was not raining in Gatamaiyu Forest.<BR>
<BR>
It <I>was </I>cool and misty, the light was poor and the tarmac road was potholed like a sieve, but the forest was alive with birds. There were termites and fruits for them to eat. We saw many of the characteristic forest birds, including both Abbott&#8217;s and Sharpe&#8217;s Starlings.<BR>
<BR>
Abbott&#8217;s Starlings were seen twice, first near the old nesting tree, and then in a Polyscias tree a short distance further. There were both black and white Abbott&#8217;s Starlings and several brown ones with paler, streaked bellies. <BR>
<BR>
In the poor light we were not sure whether the Polyscias tree had flowers or more likely ripening fruit, but it was absolutely dripping with birds &#8211; Abbott&#8217;s Starlings, Sharpe&#8217;s Starlings, Tullberg&#8217;s (Fine-banded) Woodpecker, Black-fronted Bush Shrike, Brown-capped Weaver and more.<BR>
<BR>
Wishing you good birding rain or shine, Fleur</SPAN></FONT>
