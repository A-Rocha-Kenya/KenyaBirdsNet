<div class="moz-text-flowed">About 10 days ago I heard what I could have sworn was a Carmine 
Bee-eater but thought I was imagining it so early. Then two days ago, 
yesterday and again just now we've had small flocks passing overhead 
going south. Seems very early for them to be moving...
<br>
<br>Also an Osprey seen both on Sunday 16th June and again yesterday. 
Presumably a non-breeding bird that didn't return to Europe?
<br>
<br>Sunbirds are all over in large numbers here - we've been catching many 
Amethyst and some Purple-banded neither of which are common at the A 
Rocha Kenya centre the rest of the year.
<br>
<br>An African Broadbill on the Gede Nature Trail of Arabuko-Sokoke Forest 
at the end of May is my first there. It was doing its 'brrrrrrrip!' 
display not far from where we were netting for the ringing course we ran 
but we didn't catch it!
<br>
<br>The other excitement in ASF that time was opening the nets before dawn 
on the 4th morning and looking for elephant footprints in case they'd 
been around in the night and instead seeing... lion footprints!! Two of 
the team had seen the tail of what they said was a cat disappearing into 
the forest in the headlights of the car as we first entered the forest - 
it must have been the owner of the footprints. Adds a different 
perspective on opening nets in dense forest in the dark...!!
