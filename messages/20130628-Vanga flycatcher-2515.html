<p>Yesterday 27, June while at Meru and about 4 km from Meru town at the village of Kagumoni which is cultivated area i heard the strong calling of phew pitchew from trees canopy of Meru oak tree. When i went to look i thought it was abbott's starling coz of the creamy- yellow eyes and black back all the way to breast while from under tail covert and the belly was white. </p>
<p>But the creast and a very short tail made think twice and check from the guide book which it turned out to be Black and white shrike flycatcher or Vanga flycatcher.</p>
<p>There is no joy like a joy of ticking of a new species of bird  which is not very common in Kenya on my check-list.</p>
<p>Good time birding.<br>
