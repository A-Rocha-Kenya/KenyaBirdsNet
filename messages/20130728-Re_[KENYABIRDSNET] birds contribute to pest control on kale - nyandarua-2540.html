Dear Kariuki,
This was a very interesting read, and a piece of research that was
badly lacking in Kenya.
With the Egyptians about to slaughter another 20 million of our
palearctic migrants, it will inevitably have an affect on crop
preservation, and as a result many Kenyans will go hungry! An issue
that will have to be taken up with them.
Best for now

Quantifying the contribution of birds to the control of arthropod pests on
kale, Brassica oleracea acephala, a key crop in East African highland
farmland

Bird exclusion experiments on kale (Brassica sp.) plants were undertaken to
quantify the extent to which foraging birds contributed to reducing the
densities and impact of invertebrate pests. During the dry season,
significantly higher leaf-area loss, aphid and thrips abundance were
recorded in bird-excluded compared with control plants, suggesting that
birds could make an important contribution to pest control. On average, per
week, during the dry season, exclusion of birds from kale plants led to both
a marked increase (130%) in the number of leaves infested with aphids and an
increase in leaf damage by pests (about three times greater than when birds
had access to the kale plants). These results suggest that, in the dry
season, foraging birds reduce the invertebrate pest load and hence the
amount of leaf damage in kale, and that this may, in turn, have an impact of
the market value of the crop. We recommend that measures to enhance avian
insectivory
 should be explored and encouraged in order to better take advantage of
birds in integrated pest management of kale and possibly other crops.
