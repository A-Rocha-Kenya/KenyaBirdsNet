Dear All,
I have spent a few hours going through the latest I.O.C. Checklist to
the Birds of the World, to see how this new arrangement affects our
Kenya Checklist.

In the details that follow, where two or more species are joined by an
“&amp;”, it means that we have all of these forms in Kenya, but they are
currently lumped.

Where it states “Separate From” this denotes that the first bird
mentioned is ours, but the species it is now split from is not in our
region, but they are currently lumped

Anything else that is substantial change is also mentioned,

If this were adopted it would bring major changes about to our current
checklist,

Best to all
Brian
