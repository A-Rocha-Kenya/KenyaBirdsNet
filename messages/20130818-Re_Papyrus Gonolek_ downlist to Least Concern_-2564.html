<div dir="ltr"><div>This is not good news to the kind of bird species that are dependent on papyrus. It may have started with the Gonoleks btu bearing in mind the fact that papyrus reeds are being highly extracted for basket making, other species that may need this habitat to survive are as well at risk. I have seen swamps that are dominated by papyrus reeds and even closer to major institutions yet no one has taken initiative to protect them. Marula swamp near University of Eldoret is one of them and it has been invaded that it is decreasing at an alarming rate. </div>
<div>Let&#39;s take this into our own hands, make it our own responsibility and do it out of passion. </div><div>LET&#39;S PROTECT OUR BIRDS&#39; HABITATS</div></div>
