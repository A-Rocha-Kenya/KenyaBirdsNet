Dear All,
This attitude is perfectly correct, we have to do everything to
protect our habitats to protect the birds themselves. Every habitat
needs a flagship species, and Papyrus Gonolek is a prime candidate. No
papyrus, no Papyrus Gonolek or other papyrus exclusive species.
It should under no circumstances be downlisted,
Best to all
Brian

This is not good news to the kind of bird species that are dependent on
papyrus. It may have started with the Gonoleks btu bearing in mind the fact
that papyrus reeds are being highly extracted for basket making, other
species that may need this habitat to survive are as well at risk. I have
seen swamps that are dominated by papyrus reeds and even closer to major
institutions yet no one has taken initiative to protect them. Marula swamp
near University of Eldoret is one of them and it has been invaded that it
is decreasing at an alarming rate.
Let's take this into our own hands, make it our own responsibility and do
it out of passion.
LET'S PROTECT OUR BIRDS' HABITATS
