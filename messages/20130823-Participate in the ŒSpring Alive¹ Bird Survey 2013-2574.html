Participate in the &#8216;Spring Alive&#8217; Bird Survey 2013<BR>
<BR>
&#8216;Spring Alive&#8217; is a bird watching survey coordinated by BirdLife International to track the arrival of five bird species: Barn Swallow, White Stork, Eurasian Bee eater, Common Swift, and Common Cuckoo in Europe and Africa. The birds migrate across continents each year and arrive in Africa in early September. <BR>
<BR>
The bird watching surveys are conducted in several African countries including Kenya. Participation is simple and can be great fun. All you need to do is to record the first sightings of any of the &#8216;Spring Alive&#8217; birds indicating the place, and time of the observation, species, estimated number and a brief description of the site (for example a wetland, open area, on top of a big tree etc). Send this information to office@naturekenya.org, copied to species@naturekenya.org. You can also send a text message to 0739200217, tweet @Nature_Kenya or post on our Facebook page @Nature-Kenya. <BR>
<BR>
Remember, only the first sightings should be recorded since the aim of the exercise is to gather data on the time of arrival of the birds in Africa. Information collected will be sent to BirdLife International. Thanks to your observations scientists at BirdLife will be able to analyze the results to track the arrival of migrants every year. <BR>
<BR>
The &#8216;Spring Alive&#8217; project is being conducted with support from the Mitsubishi Corporation Fund for Europe and Africa. For more information visit www.springalive.net<BR>
