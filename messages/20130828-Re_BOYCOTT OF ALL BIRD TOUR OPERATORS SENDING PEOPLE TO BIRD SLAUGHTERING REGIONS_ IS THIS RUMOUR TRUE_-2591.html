Hi Brian,

I submitted a reply to this post earlier but for some reason it hasn't shown up on the Forum.

I'm wondering if this delay is due to posts been screened by the Moderator or just heavy traffic on YahooGroups causing delays.

However, it's possible that the system is set to default replies to the Sender, rather than the Forum and I failed to notice this.  If you received my reply, please could I trouble you to post it back on the Forum?

Thanks in advance and best regards,

Nick

Dear All,
As I write millions more migrants are being slaughtered in Egypt, and
will not make it here to East Africa where without the natural
insecticide provided by these insectivores, crops will become infested
with insect pests and East Africans will go hungry.

It all seemed so gloomy but the latest piece of news is that Birdlife
International is going to draw up a list and name and shame all the
bird tour operators that continue advertising and leading bird tours
in Egypt, but in addition other bird slaughtering regions Cyprus,
Malta, Sardinia, Morocco, and others.

At present this is just a rumour, but if true it is a great move that
Birdlife will be sending this message, they must be congratulated for
taking this radical step, and we must support them in this endeavour.
They will of course be recommending a total boycott by concerned
birders for all companies continuing to operate in these countries.

Has anyone else heard about this, I really think it is a good move and
they must be congratulated for taking this approach. It will at least
make the whole issue of annual bird slaughters a world wide problem to
be rectified and not just regional as it is now. Lets hope that the
other major conservation groups all over the world follow suit.

Best to all
Brian
