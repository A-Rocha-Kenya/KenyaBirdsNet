Dear Mohamed,
I think it is easy money. There is no control, the birds are consumed
in the cities by many of the business community who have the means to
be able to pay for pleasure of biting off the heads of Blackcaps,
Google Egypt Bird Slaughter, then if your stomach can handle it, move
out to Morocco, Sardinia, Cyprus etc.

Best for now
Brian

Dear Brian,

What has prompted this slaughter, are there any reasons for this large scale
slaughter?

No matter how harmful it is, surely those who do it have something to gain
from this wanton destruction?

Dear All

Re: Birdsnet from Brian Finch: BOYCOTT ON ALL BIRD TOUR OPERATORS SENDING
PEOPLE TO BIRD SALUGHTERING REGIONS

If it is true this would indeed be a very good move by Birdlife.  I have
read so many really alarming reports of the slaughter which is going on.  We
certainly have far less migrants now than in years gone by and one wonders
if in a few years we are going to see any at all?

If a boycott could be encouraged by Birdlife Int.  it might just be a
wake-up call but in the countries where political mayhem is raging e.g.
Egypt where people are being shot right left and centre will anyone worry
about birds being shot?

Dear All,
As I write millions more migrants are being slaughtered in Egypt, and
will not make it here to East Africa where without the natural
insecticide provided by these insectivores, crops will become infested
with insect pests and East Africans will go hungry.

It all seemed so gloomy but the latest piece of news is that Birdlife
International is going to draw up a list and name and shame all the
bird tour operators that continue advertising and leading bird tours
in Egypt, but in addition other bird slaughtering regions Cyprus,
Malta, Sardinia, Morocco, and others.

At present this is just a rumour, but if true it is a great move that
Birdlife will be sending this message, they must be congratulated for
taking this radical step, and we must support them in this endeavour.
They will of course be recommending a total boycott by concerned
birders for all companies continuing to operate in these countries.

Has anyone else heard about this, I really think it is a good move and
they must be congratulated for taking this approach. It will at least
make the whole issue of annual bird slaughters a world wide problem to
be rectified and not just regional as it is now. Lets hope that the
other major conservation groups all over the world follow suit.

Best to all
Brian
