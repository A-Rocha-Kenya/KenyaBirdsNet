Having lived and birded in Egypt for 7 years during the 1990s, I agree
totally with these comments. All best, John Dawson

Hi Brian,

I haven't heard about this policy and would be rather surprised if it is
found to be true. I heard nothing mentioned about such a boycott at last
month's BirdLife World Congress in Canada and it would seem to run counter
to the organisation's policies to date.

Personally, I think this move could well be ineffective and actually
counter-productive.

Isn't one of the best way to persuade people to change their own behaviour,
or those of their fellow citizens, to actively engage with them and to
communicate face-to-face?

I anticipate that, in Egypt at least, the number of annual BirdTours
and Birdwatchers is miniscule when compared with other interest groups such
as sun-seekers, sightseers, divers, photographers, etc. etc.  If Birders
stop visiting the country would anyone actually notice? Let
alone consider changing their behaviors? And besides there won't be anyone
or anything to demonstrate to local people that there are
alternative ways of doing things.

I believe that a concerted campaign spearheaded by BirdLife but
utilising BirdTour Operators and their Clients would likely be far more
effective.  Developing hand-outs and other literature in both Arabic and
English containing carefully crafted messages about conservation and
sustainable use options would be a good start. Then BirdTours and their
Clients could use these leaflets to actively engage with anyone and everyone
they meet in the country.

My experience in Egypt is that people are highly inquisitive when they
see a Birdwatcher in the field, and they are always amazed to look through
binoculars or a scope. However, most visiting Birders (including myself) are
unable to communicate effectively in the local language so opportunities for
real engagement are almost always missed.

What if all BirdTour Operators committed to carrying say 500 leaflets
in their vehicles on every trip, and Clients were actively encouraged to
hand them out? Surely this is likely to be far more effective at tapping
into local people's interests and good sense? After all, the Bedouin tribes
were actaully practicing ecological sustainability thousands of years before
the concept was even recognised in the West!

Best regards,

Nick

Dear All,
As I write millions more migrants are being slaughtered in Egypt, and
will not make it here to East Africa where without the natural
insecticide provided by these insectivores, crops will become infested
with insect pests and East Africans will go hungry.

It all seemed so gloomy but the latest piece of news is that Birdlife
International is going to draw up a list and name and shame all the
bird tour operators that continue advertising and leading bird tours
in Egypt, but in addition other bird slaughtering regions Cyprus,
Malta, Sardinia, Morocco, and others.

At present this is just a rumour, but if true it is a great move that
Birdlife will be sending this message, they must be congratulated for
taking this radical step, and we must support them in this endeavour.
They will of course be recommending a total boycott by concerned
birders for all companies continuing to operate in these countries.

Has anyone else heard about this, I really think it is a good move and
they must be congratulated for taking this approach. It will at least
make the whole issue of annual bird slaughters a world wide problem to
be rectified and not just regional as it is now. Lets hope that the
other major conservation groups all over the world follow suit.

Best to all
Brian
