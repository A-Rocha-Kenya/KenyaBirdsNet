Dear All,
Yesterday I happened to glance out of the window into the Fever Tree
in the garden and noticed a small honeyguide. It was not dashing about
madly like Eastern Honeybird (our commonest and daily member of the
family), but flying to a perch, sitting still for a period and flying
to another perch and doing the same. I thought I had better get my
binoculars and have a look, as this was far from honeybird habits.
When I looked at it, I was amazed to see that the bird was a tiny
Pallid Honeyguide and no honeybird at all.
I watched it for a while, then thought I should get the camera which I
did, and when I returned it had already become a distant memory!
Best for now
Brian
