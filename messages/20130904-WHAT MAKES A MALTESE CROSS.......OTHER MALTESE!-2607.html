Dear All,
We haven’t really got our ball together yet, but when we do it must be
kept rolling until we have ended the annihilation of our migrants.
This is quite long, but please take time to read about what the
Maltese are trying to do with other Maltese shooting protected species
in Egypt, and how they are working with conservation bodies in Egypt.
This report is interesting as it gives an insight into the Egyptian
govenment and "responsible bodies," attitudes towards the matter.
However it also shows that we do have allies within these countries.

I would have liked to have attached a petition to have an Open Season
commence on Maltese Hunters, but we are still working out the finer
points of the document!

Best for now
Brian
