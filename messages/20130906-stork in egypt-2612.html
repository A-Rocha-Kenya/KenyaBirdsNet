Just a sidenote on something which keeps my country (Hungary) excited for a while now :))
So we have a satellite tracking program for several species, eg. Red-footed Falcon, Saker, Imperial Eagle and White Storks, which is our national bird, and we love them dearly. Now we had a stork captured in Egypt by a local, because he recognised the transmitter on its back, and tought its a spy, maybe from Israel :)) It took a week to recover and release the stork with some diplomatic effort, there was even a bit of tension between Egypt and Hungary. Some days ago the stork was released, and the latest news is just arrived to my mailbox...  it was shoot and eaten yesterday a bit further south near Assuan... now we try to get back the transmitter at least... Sick...

I think somebody should smuggle out the mummies of Tut and Ramses from Egyptian Museum asap, and deposit them in British Museum, otherwise they will be eaten very soon. 

The tracking website:
