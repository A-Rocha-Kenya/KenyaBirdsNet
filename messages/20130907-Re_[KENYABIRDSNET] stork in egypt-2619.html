That is a very sad tale, of a magnifivent and beneficial bird. In
sub-saharan Africa they are one of the great predators of Army Worm.
This is a moth caterpillar that periodically occurs in very
devastating plagues devouring a wide variety of crops, causing local
famine. Without these White Storks I guess we can see plagues of Army
Worm and resulting famine more frequently unless the Egyptian tide of
bird annihilation is turned.
Thanks for the tracking website, it will be interesting to see the
route the other birds take,
Best to all

Just a sidenote on something which keeps my country (Hungary) excited for a
while now :))
So we have a satellite tracking program for several species, eg. Red-footed
Falcon, Saker, Imperial Eagle and White Storks, which is our national bird,
and we love them dearly. Now we had a stork captured in Egypt by a local,
because he recognised the transmitter on its back, and tought its a spy,
maybe from Israel :)) It took a week to recover and release the stork with
some diplomatic effort, there was even a bit of tension between Egypt and
Hungary. Some days ago the stork was released, and the latest news is just
arrived to my mailbox...  it was shoot and eaten yesterday a bit further
south near Assuan... now we try to get back the transmitter at least...
Sick...

I think somebody should smuggle out the mummies of Tut and Ramses from
Egyptian Museum asap, and deposit them in British Museum, otherwise they
will be eaten very soon.

The tracking website:
