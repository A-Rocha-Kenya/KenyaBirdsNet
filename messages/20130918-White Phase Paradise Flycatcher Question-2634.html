<div dir="ltr">Hello All,<div>On a less political note, something that I have wondered about for some time is what is going on with Paradise Flycatcher evolution.  In the dry luggas that we walk in, in northern Kenya there is a high frequency of &#39;white phase paradise flycatchers&#39;. These white birds though are always males in my experience. I can&#39;t say that I have seen a &#39;white phase&#39; female (possibly I&#39;m just being un-observant?).  </div>
<div>Anyway,  I can&#39;t remember what the definition of a &#39;phase&#39; is but If only some males are white and the females remain always their normal orangy-red does that mean that the females of the white males are also &#39;white phase&#39;?</div>
<div>Also, I assume what we see with these flycatchers is the beginning of a speciation by sexual selection (?)  If this is so I also wonder if there has ever been records kept of the frequency of &#39;white phase paradise flycatchers&#39; over many years (do they appear in south africa?). It would be fascinating to know how quickly this process marches forward and if it will be dominant enough of gene to eventually also turn the females white.</div>
<div>Cheers,<br clear="all">
