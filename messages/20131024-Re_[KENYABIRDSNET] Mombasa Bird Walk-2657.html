    9:30am. Sitting in a meeting on our flat roof at the A Rocha Kenya
    centre in Watamu - just had the first Barn Swallows moving south
    here - I had two singles at Sabaki last week and one last month, but
    these are the first in any number. <br>
    <br>
    Also Blue-cheeked Bee-eaters are going through in small numbers most
    mornings this week.<br>

                Vipingo beach where I only saw a couple of Greenshanks,
                a pair of Common Sandpipers, one or two Whimbrels and a
                few scattered Grey Plovers plus a single Ringed Plover.&nbsp;
                This beach used to be covered in waders.&nbsp; The food chain
                may have something to do with it as there are literally
                dozens of people all collecting small things off the
                reef, all walking away with a half-filled bag.&nbsp; This is
                just on the outside of the Kurawitu restricted area
                where I am told that the controlled fishing has led to
                resurgence of fish stocks.</font></div>
