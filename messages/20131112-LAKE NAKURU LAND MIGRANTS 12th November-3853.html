Dear All,
Reviewing the last 20 signatories to the Egyptian protest today, no
less than 13 were Russian, which I find heart-warming as this is where
most of these migrants have their breeding ranges...... and biggest
disappointment as far as regional support still shows Tanzania well in
the lead with an apathetic (but the support of those four is much
appreciated) four signatures. (Here is a dictionary definition of
Apathetic..... showing or feeling no interest, enthusiasm, or
concern). Maybe they will change!

Land migrants in Nakuru today.... 3 Lesser Kestrels, 1 Eurasian Marsh
Harrier, 10 Common Buzzards, a flock of 40 Eurasian Bee-eaters, 1
Eurasian Roller, 1 Common Cuckoo, one each Whinchat, Isabelline,
Northern Wheatears and Red-tailed Shirke, 20 Yellow Wags, 10 Willow
Warblers a smattering of Barn Swallows. Not exactly impressive is it.
The Med murderers have made serious inroads into our birds. Please
keep on spreading the word

Come on Kenya, push the petition, try and find fresh ideas for
circulating the site and securing more valuable votes of support.

Following on from the discussion of the Lebanese hunter and his Golden
Oriole "trophies"...
I think Adam and James should apologise for just calling the man a
fool, what they should have said is a wealthy selfish egoistic
mentaily unstable cold blooded avicidal barbarian, but no fool, just
an elitist rich sob who decimates our birds purely for his own
personal, sick sadistic pleasure and must be stopped by whatever means
necessary. I am stunned that anyone would try and justify the actions
of this individual..... just an opinion!

Best to all
Brian
