<div class="moz-text-flowed">We've had a really great passage of mostly Blue-cheeked Bee-eaters over 
the past 2-3 weeks through Watamu with a few flocks of Euro Bee-eaters 
as well. Not so many Carmine but some reasonable numbers of 
White-throated which are always stunning to see!
<br>
<br>Two weeks ago we had 2 Honey Buzzards over Mwamba and one seen up at 
Gede from the road.
<br>
<br>Yesterday a Sprosser was ringed at Mwamba - our 5th ever and first in 
the southward migration - all the others have been in the northward 
migration which is normally better for passerine migrants on the coast. 
ALso had Spot Flys and a few Red-backed Shrikes and at Sabaki a week ago 
about 5 Northern Wheatears.
<br>
<br>Finally lots of Barn Swallows moving through and a handful of Sand 
Martins thrown in as well.
<br>
<br>Mad Pond Heron at Arabuko Swamp a week ago was also very nice and my 
first for a long time around our area - when ten years ago we used to 
see them very easily...
<br>
<br>A young Ayres' Hawk Eagle sat in a tree just along the beach from Mwamba 
was nice this past week as well. A pair of Martial Eagles over Arabuko 
Swamp was also very nice - where the Malindi Pipits were showing nicely 
the one day and when we went back a week later try and ring them... not 
a sign!
