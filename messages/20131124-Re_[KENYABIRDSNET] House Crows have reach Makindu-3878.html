<p><font color="#0f0f0f" size="3" face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong>Yes, you are so right--action needs to be taken and soon! It is also important to eliminate these crows from the Kenya coast, as they all originate mainly from Mombasa and thrive on uncollected garbage and the worsening situation there with multiple issues regarding governance. As Brian Finch once said, "Mombasa stinks" is so very true. The Makindu exercise cannot be enduring, if the source is not nipped in the bud!</strong></font>
</p>
<p><font color="#0f0f0f" size="3" face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong>I recall the old Cap 376 of the Wild Animals Protection Act for the Kenya Game Department.&nbsp;A separate one for Kenya National Parks was also available&nbsp;in the very early 1960's. Anyone aware of the new Wildlife Act and whether it includes protection of alien species? The old ordinance/s did not mention anything about introduced species. One was therefore free to use any means to destroy or eliminate any pest using whatever means, including a flame-thrower!</strong></font>
</p>
<p><font color="#0f0f0f" size="3" face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong>While it is prudent to seek help and consent from KWS, I know that they are at times not very helpful. A case in point was the outbreak of Dengue Fever in Mombasa caused by Vervet monkeys. A researcher from Chiromo's Primate Centre sought assistance from the KWS director at the coast to help eliminate Vervet monkeys from a residential area of Mombasa island. He also requested if that was not possible, then the monkeys should be trapped and relocated to an area away from humans. Sadly assistance was not forthcoming! The director's response was that he could not decide and had to&nbsp;get approval from Nairobi!

  <br />
  <br />We are talking to each other,. Is anyone talking to KWS at Kiboko or the management of the Sikh temple at Makindu?

  <br />Wishing you good birding, Fleur

          <br />Hi All,
          <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <br />I just received a call from Brian Finch who is on tour with clients.
          <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <br />He has just seen House Crows at the Sikh Temple in Makindu. This could be their penultimate bastion before reaching Nairobi so if anyone (especially the staff at the Museum) has the means to 'control' these birds, then please do now quickly.
          <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <br />Cheers for now
          <br />Adam
          <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <br /></span></font>
