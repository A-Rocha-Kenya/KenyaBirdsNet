Could somebody from the Museum or some obvious authority, please tell
Mwangi where House Crows come from, how they got here, what they have
done to native birds in Kenya, and what they will do if they get
inland, into all the cities and worse, all of the National Parks and
reserves. Concerning the comparison to the slaughtering of birds in
Egypt, q

Dear All,
I photographed the House Crow near the temple at Makindu a few hours
ago on the return journey from Tsavo. It is obviously liking it there,
and having negotiated the Tsavo Plain (thought to be a barrier for
spread from the coast), the rest of the country is now wide open to
invasion, Nairobi will start losing its birds very soon if something
is not done immediately.
Best for now

As bad as it might sound I don't support 'killing crow' initiatives.
When
will man learn to respect nature &amp; let it propagate itself in its own

Let nature take course!

Thanks.

Hi all

Someone MUST talk to someone in Authority in government.

We have taken our abt 1.2 million house crows in Tanzania using DRC1339
and traps.

Traps work ... crows DO NOT learn, we kill them before they can !!

One must kill them in the dark after birds outside have gone to roost.
leaving 2 birds in the trap to attract others the following day.

Our President has 10 working traps in State House. They have taken out
more than 100,000 crows in the past 4 years.

Fresh food and clean water every day is all it takes........ and a
certain amount of common sense !!!

stop talking abt it in Kenya and DO IT.
