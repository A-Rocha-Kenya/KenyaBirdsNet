<div class="moz-text-flowed">Dear Birders
<br>
<br>This news is very encouraging and we pray for the success of the Bonn edict 
and a possible implementation of a Quail breeding project although from what 
I have seen on the net birds are being targeted for other reasons than 
eating by the poor.&nbsp; Migrants at the coast this year (well around Mombasa 
anyway) are so few that I fear if the carnage continues there will be none 
at all next year.&nbsp; We await Brian's news of numbers in Tsavo which we hope 
will not be so dismal.

<br>
<br>
<br>Dear Nick,
<br>Thanks for highlighting the recently held Bonn Meeting regarding the
<br>unsustainable bird trapping in Egypt and Libya, and providing the site
<br>details.
<br>
<br>I listened to the video comments with much interest, (and urge all on
<br>the net to do likewise), by both Noor Noor and Marcus Koehler, and
<br>found the new initiative very encouraging, and thought Noor’s
<br>reporting very sincere and a good man to have steering the programme.
<br>
<br>Whilst he was giving details of Quail trapping as an annual means of
<br>sustenance and income as being important to the poorer Egyptians, I
<br>had a thought that if Quail are the major issue here, in Kenya they
<br>are farmed with relative ease and maybe Egyptians should also be aided
<br>in setting up commercial and domestic ventures. I couldn’t believe it
<br>when after the videos had finished that Adam had also suggested the
<br>same.&nbsp; It all seemed so obvious.
<br>
<br>Whilst the hoardes of harvested passerines are still termed as
<br>“by-catch”, I think there is little doubt that they are now targets
<br>sought out.
<br>
<br>However I find it all very encouraging that the issues are now getting
<br>the attention that they deserve, and that so many parties are getting
<br>together to find a common solution acceptable to all involved. Not
<br>sure that next years harvest should be just counted and not countered,
<br>if you could see the change that we see here with regards to the
<br>numbers of migrants reaching us, especially shrikes but also warblers,
<br>chats, wagtails etc., then you would also want more than just an
<br>accurate count of birds slaughtered in 2014 and 2015.
<br>
<br>I am off to Ngulia in Tsavo West tomorrow for three nights of migrant
<br>study, and will report on the findings.
<br>
<br>I was absolutely enthralled to see a flock of 15000 Amur Falcons come
<br>down to feed in Tsavo a couple of weeks ago, the Nagaland story is a
<br>pleasing solution that we would like to see repeated time and time
<br>again.
<br>
<br>Best for now, and thanks again,
<br>Brian

<br><blockquote type=cite>Hi Nick,
<br>
<br>Thanks very much for posting this important announcement and keeping the
<br>kenyabirdnet 'in the loop' about developments.
<br>
<br>I think that Mr. Noor Noor gives a very good presentation of the issues
<br>faced on both sides of the problem and he is clearly very passionate about
<br>finding a resolution. With the right level of support, from BLI and other
<br>parties, he could well be the chap that gets things done.
<br>
<br>It is unfortunate that the 2014-15 seasons will merely be 'monitored' to
<br>ascertain the numerical facts, however, and I can't help but feel that yet
<br>another full season of slaughter may be 'one season too many' for more 
than
<br>just a few species. From what we are seeing in Kenya, the numbers of
<br>migrants remain massively down on previous years, especially shrikes. Can
<br>one more year of 'by-catch' really be allowed/ sanctioned? Surely there is
<br>a will, and therefore a way, to monitor the catch without kiling all the
<br>birds next year? Can the bird-ringers of this world not get together and
<br>monitor the catch, paying their way to keep the locals 'sustained' until
<br>the previous year when more (or other) solutions can be found?
<br>
<br>One such solution is very simple and I have yet to hear it mentioned or
<br>addressed - Quail farming. Numerous species of quail are intensively 
farmed
<br>around the world and so if the Libyan and Egyptian people are catching
<br>these birds out of economic need, surely BLI and others can provide the
<br>know-how and finance to set the people up in aviculture?
<br>
<br>I'm sure that between us all, we can come up with more simple and 
effective
<br>ideas but how do we get these in front of the right people, Nick?
<br>
<br>Cheers for now,
<br>Adam

<br>Greetings Kenyan Birders,
<br>
<br>
<br>For those interested in the above issue, I urge you to follow this link
<br>to
<br>a BirdLife International report of a recent meeting held in Bonn, and
<br>hosted by colleagues at the AEWA Secretariat.
<br>
<br>
<br><a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.birdlife.org/africa/news/concern-over-migrant-birds-prompts-international-response">http://www.birdlife.org/africa/news/concern-over-migrant-birds-prompts-international-response</a>
<br>
<br>Included in the report is a video interview with Noor Noor, Executive
<br>Coordinator of Nature Conservation Egypt.&nbsp; Please do take time to listen
<br>to
<br>what Noor, and others have to say on the subject.
<br>
<br>It will be a complex and challenging task to address this problem,
<br>especially given the other pressures facing the two Governments at the
<br>current time.&nbsp; However, the meeting set the scene for important and
<br>ongoing
<br>international cooperation and support, which I believe provides real hope
<br>that a effective and long-term solutions can be found.
