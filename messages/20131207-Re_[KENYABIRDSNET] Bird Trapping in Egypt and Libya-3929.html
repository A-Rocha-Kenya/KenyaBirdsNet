Hello

Just had a brief discussion with Noor (Egypt) regarding quail farming. He informed me that already there is extensive quail farming in the country. However the demand for wild-caught quails is still driven by the traditional perception that only wild-caught birds can serve perceived enhancing purpose for which they are eaten. So even in the market someone would be looking for the 'thinner' wild caught birds rather than the 'fatter' domesticated birds.

Best regards
Kariuki

 Dear Birders
 
 This news is very encouraging and we pray for the success of
 the Bonn edict 
 and a possible implementation of a Quail breeding project
 although from what 
 I have seen on the net birds are being targeted for other
 reasons than 
 eating by the poor.  Migrants at the coast this year
 (well around Mombasa 
 anyway) are so few that I fear if the carnage continues
 there will be none 
 at all next year.  We await Brian's news of numbers in
 Tsavo which we hope 
 will not be so dismal.

 Subject: Re: [KENYABIRDSNET] Bird Trapping in Egypt and
 Libya
 
 
 Dear Nick,
 Thanks for highlighting the recently held Bonn Meeting
 regarding the
 unsustainable bird trapping in Egypt and Libya, and
 providing the site
 details.
 
 I listened to the video comments with much interest, (and
 urge all on
 the net to do likewise), by both Noor Noor and Marcus
 Koehler, and
 found the new initiative very encouraging, and thought
 Noor’s
 reporting very sincere and a good man to have steering the
 programme.
 
 Whilst he was giving details of Quail trapping as an annual
 means of
 sustenance and income as being important to the poorer
 Egyptians, I
 had a thought that if Quail are the major issue here, in
 Kenya they
 are farmed with relative ease and maybe Egyptians should
 also be aided
 in setting up commercial and domestic ventures. I couldn’t
 believe it
 when after the videos had finished that Adam had also
 suggested the
 same.  It all seemed so obvious.
 
 Whilst the hoardes of harvested passerines are still termed
 as
 “by-catch”, I think there is little doubt that they are
 now targets
 sought out.
 
 However I find it all very encouraging that the issues are
 now getting
 the attention that they deserve, and that so many parties
 are getting
 together to find a common solution acceptable to all
 involved. Not
 sure that next years harvest should be just counted and not
 countered,
 if you could see the change that we see here with regards to
 the
 numbers of migrants reaching us, especially shrikes but also
 warblers,
 chats, wagtails etc., then you would also want more than
 just an
 accurate count of birds slaughtered in 2014 and 2015.
 
 I am off to Ngulia in Tsavo West tomorrow for three nights
 of migrant
 study, and will report on the findings.
 
 I was absolutely enthralled to see a flock of 15000 Amur
 Falcons come
 down to feed in Tsavo a couple of weeks ago, the Nagaland
 story is a
 pleasing solution that we would like to see repeated time
 and time
 again.
 
 Best for now, and thanks again,
 Brian

 &gt; Hi Nick,
 &gt;
 &gt; Thanks very much for posting this important
 announcement and keeping the
 &gt; kenyabirdnet 'in the loop' about developments.
 &gt;
 &gt; I think that Mr. Noor Noor gives a very good
 presentation of the issues
 &gt; faced on both sides of the problem and he is clearly
 very passionate about
 &gt; finding a resolution. With the right level of support,
 from BLI and other
 &gt; parties, he could well be the chap that gets things
 done.
 &gt;
 &gt; It is unfortunate that the 2014-15 seasons will merely
 be 'monitored' to
 &gt; ascertain the numerical facts, however, and I can't
 help but feel that yet
 &gt; another full season of slaughter may be 'one season too
 many' for more 
 &gt; than
 &gt; just a few species. From what we are seeing in Kenya,
 the numbers of
 &gt; migrants remain massively down on previous years,
 especially shrikes. Can
 &gt; one more year of 'by-catch' really be allowed/
 sanctioned? Surely there is
 &gt; a will, and therefore a way, to monitor the catch
 without kiling all the
 &gt; birds next year? Can the bird-ringers of this world not
 get together and
 &gt; monitor the catch, paying their way to keep the locals
 'sustained' until
 &gt; the previous year when more (or other) solutions can be
 found?
 &gt;
 &gt; One such solution is very simple and I have yet to hear
 it mentioned or
 &gt; addressed - Quail farming. Numerous species of quail
 are intensively 
 &gt; farmed
 &gt; around the world and so if the Libyan and Egyptian
 people are catching
 &gt; these birds out of economic need, surely BLI and others
 can provide the
 &gt; know-how and finance to set the people up in
 aviculture?
 &gt;
 &gt; I'm sure that between us all, we can come up with more
 simple and 
 &gt; effective
 &gt; ideas but how do we get these in front of the right
 people, Nick?
 &gt;
 &gt; Cheers for now,
 &gt; Adam
 &gt;

 &gt;&gt; Greetings Kenyan Birders,
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; For those interested in the above issue, I urge you
 to follow this link
 &gt;&gt; to
 &gt;&gt; a BirdLife International report of a recent meeting
 held in Bonn, and
 &gt;&gt; hosted by colleagues at the AEWA Secretariat.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.birdlife.org/africa/news/concern-over-migrant-birds-prompts-international-response">http://www.birdlife.org/africa/news/concern-over-migrant-birds-prompts-international-response</a>
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; Included in the report is a video interview with
 Noor Noor, Executive
 &gt;&gt; Coordinator of Nature Conservation Egypt. 
 Please do take time to listen
 &gt;&gt; to
 &gt;&gt; what Noor, and others have to say on the subject.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; It will be a complex and challenging task to
 address this problem,
 &gt;&gt; especially given the other pressures facing the two
 Governments at the
 &gt;&gt; current time.  However, the meeting set the
 scene for important and
 &gt;&gt; ongoing
 &gt;&gt; international cooperation and support, which I
 believe provides real hope
 &gt;&gt; that a effective and long-term solutions can be
 found.
