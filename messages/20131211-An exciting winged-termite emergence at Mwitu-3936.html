<div dir="ltr"><div><div><div><div><div>Hi All,<br><br></div>During a rain storm over Mwitu Estate, Karen, yesterday afternoon, I noticed a commotion of birds gathering around an emergence of winged termites in the garden. <br>
<br></div>In the group, that were feeding from trees mainly 10m off the ground, I saw Red-chested Cuckoo, (Eastern) Black-headed Oriole, Cinnamon-chested Bee-eater, Northern Double-collared and Variable Sunbirds and many bulbuls, all feasting on the bounty. There were probably more species involved but I was then distracted by a reddish-tailed raptor that flew in to land above the group and as I went to inspect it, my attention was drawn away again by a characteristic &quot;ku-ku-ku&quot; call made by our local Bat Hawk whizzing overhead. It made about 8 passes over the emergence and although I didn&#39;t witness a catch, I assume that it too was catching the termites, like a Hobby. I don&#39;t believe that this prey item has been recorded before. Once the Bat Hawk had disappeared, I made my way over to the other raptor and found a Steppe Buzzard still perched where it had landed.<br>
</div><br></div>It was obviously a popular feast!<br><br></div>Cheers for now,<br>Adam<br></div>
