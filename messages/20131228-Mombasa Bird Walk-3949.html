<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Sat. 21st Dec. at Nguuni Sanctuary</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>A quick walk to the wetland did not produce much 
and even the woodland on the way up was unnaturally quiet,&nbsp; Lots of 
Northern Brownbuls and Barn Swallows with a few Northern Carmine Bee-eaters 
flying over the water.&nbsp; Migrant waders were very few, just a small group 
and far away so could only identify 2 Wood Sandpipers.&nbsp; African Darter, 
Reed Cormorant and a lone Open-Billed Stork, Sacred Ibis, Cattle Egrets, 
Woolly-necked Stork, Black-headed Heron&nbsp;and a pair of White-faced Whistling 
ducks were the main water birds.&nbsp; Large numbers of Water Thick-knees which 
breed all around this area.&nbsp; A drive up to the picnic site, just beating 
the arrival of the 'sundowner crowd' where a flock of White-throated bee-eaters 
flew overhead and there was a pair of Scarlet-chested sunbirds and a solitary 
Amethyst which we haven't seen in ages.&nbsp; A Black-chested Snake Eagle 
circled round and I saw my first Spotted Flycatcher of the season, in fact there 
were many of these little birds,&nbsp;hopefully they were eating some of the 
thousands of ticks at Nuguuni.&nbsp; Another migrant was a superb Red-backed 
Shrike.&nbsp; Three species of Kingfisher; Striped, Pied and Grey-headed.&nbsp; 
Lots of&nbsp; seed-eating birds but strangely no Zanzibar Bishops and not a 
single Bare-eyed Thrush,&nbsp;nearly always seen.&nbsp; A quick flash of a 
Lizard Buzzard and some superb Yellow-Throated Longclaws which obligingly 
perching on small bushes so all the walkers could get a good look.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>As it was the last walk of the year and to 
celebrate Xmas we spent our last half hour on the ramshackle verandah of the 
lakeside lookout eating Lumberjack cake and biscuits and enjoying a 
drink&nbsp;being rewarded with African Jacana, juvenile Allen's Gallinule, 
Little grebe, Little Bittern and a Common Squacco Heron walking on the lilys 
just in front of us with Grosbeak and Golden Palm Weavers coming in to 
roost.&nbsp; A great walk to end the year -&nbsp;a totqal of 46 species - a good 
number for not much over 2 hours.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Wishing you all 'Happy Birding' in 
2014</FONT></DIV>
