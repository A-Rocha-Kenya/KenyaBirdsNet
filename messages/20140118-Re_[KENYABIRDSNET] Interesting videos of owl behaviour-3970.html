Hi Kieran,

I can help you get your videos online

Dropbox is a fallback but not a great option - pls read below

The easiest is probably youtube - I am not sure if you have uploaded videos
ever

If not, just goto <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.youtube.com">www.youtube.com</a> and look in the top right corner - it
might show you are logged in if you use gmil on the same computer/browser.
If not, look for links on the top right, as in gmail, to sign in

Once signed in, on the top right will be a link to upload videos

And it will lead you from there on - even big videos

There is a 10-15 minute limit on the video you can upload - so play the
video file on your PC to see how long your video is

If your internet connection is not very fast and breaks down - you might
need to convert your videos to a smaller file size before you cna upload to
youtube. You might need to split up your video into 10-15 minute video
segments also

so the steps are:
- Is any single video file duration 10-15 mins
- If yes, sign into youtube and upload it. If it uploads - make sure the
video is "public" so thatthe link that you share can be viewed by all
- if youtube upload times out/breaks, you might need to convert the video
file

Lets take this one step at a time...

My email is <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:aveeshkumar@gmail.com">aveeshkumar@gmail.com</a>. My skype id is aveeshkumar - I am no
longer in Nairobi/Kenya

Cheers

Aveesh
