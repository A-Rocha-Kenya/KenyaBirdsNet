<div dir="ltr"><div><div><div><div>Hi Titus &amp; Adam,<br><br></div>I am VERY rusty when it comes to African Illadopsis species, but this photo shows a rather white throat, too white for Mountain, but on the other hand the rest of the underparts are too grey for a Brown or Pale-breasted. Perhaps it is Mountain with paler throat than usual. Any more photos?<br>
</div>I guess that when the higher part of Kakamega forest was destroyed in late 1970s (I think I earlier said 1980s, but I now think it was earlier than that) the Mountain Illadopsis was able to adapt to lower altitudes, which it had not been able to do, or perhaps didn&#39;t try, before. All very interesting.<br>
</div>Too long ago to expect any of my ringed birds to turn up - I last ringed there in 1975. Some of my ringed birds turned up as specimens in the Nat Hist Museum, Tring, although I had asked the collector not to take any ringed birds. He did not even bother to remove the rings! One was a Grey-chested!<br>

      <p></p><div dir="ltr"><div><div><div><div>Hi Clive,<br><br></div>Find attached an image of the illadopsis in question. You are not alone in thinking that Mountain doesn&#39;t occur at this site and I tend to agree with your supposition that these birds might be recent immigrants from other areas, which is understandable given the loss of forest habitat in the region over the past 30 years.<br>

<br></div>One minor corretion to Titus&#39; records is that Yellow-whiskered Greenbuls were caught rather than Yellow-throated. Rather modestly, he also omitted my lifer that he pulled from the net - Grey-chested Babbler (definitely not an Illadopsis!).<br>

      <p></p><div dir="ltr"><div><div><div><div>Hi Titus,<br><br></div>I was very interested to receive your account of ringing in Kakamega Forest. I once found a dead Gabon Viper there but never a Jameson&#39;s Mamba. I did have a Spitting Cobra get entangled in my mistnets in my house in Soroti when I was away. It died and was badly decomposed when I found it.<br>


<br></div>I ringed regularly there in the early 1970&#39;s and wrote up my results in <i>Ostrich</i> 1985. 56: 236-262.<br></div> I only found Mountain Illadopsis at one site which was higher than the Rest House area, and was in fact in Nandi District. This part of the forest was destroyed in the 1980s. I wondered if you could have been mistaken and perhaps it was Brown Illadopsis you caught. I suppose it is possible that Mountain has moved to a lower altitude.<br>
