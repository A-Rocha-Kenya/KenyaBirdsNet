<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Bird Walk&nbsp;on 18th Jan at Haller Park: South 
Quarry:</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>First bird was African Fish Eagle flying overhead 
but the quarry was pretty quiet.&nbsp; The ponds seem to be somewhat polluted 
and water birds were few.&nbsp; In fact a tidal puddle was more interesting with 
Three banded Plovers, Ringed Plover (unusual away from the beach), Little Stints 
and African Pied Wagtails.&nbsp; The only other migrant wader was a solitary 
Common Sandpiper at one of the ponds; a splendid Malachite Kingfisher did give 
us all a very good view.&nbsp; Purple Heron taking off was just a brief 
glimpse.&nbsp; As there was so little about and as we were being harassed by a 
very determined male Giraffe, tact seemed to be the better part of valour and so 
we adjourned to Haller Park.&nbsp; There we saw another 15 species which 
included Black Capped Night Heron, African Harrier Hawk, two more African Fish 
Eagles (one may have been the one seen earlier) Giant Kingfisher, another common 
Sand and an amazing 4 Black Herons who very obligingly did their umbrella 
fishing together right in the eye of Doris's camera.&nbsp; A total of 34 species 
in all.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Last week spending 5 days at Tiwi Beach was very 
happy to see for the first time in ages a good number of migrant waders.&nbsp; 
They all seemed to be in species groups:&nbsp; 60-70 Grey Plovers, 18 Whimbrels, 
large group of Great with a few Lesser Sand Plovers, a couple of Little Stints 
and 2 or 3 Ruddy Turnstones.&nbsp; Latter 2 groups I just saw once and then in 
ones and twos but the Plovers stayed together all the time and moved up and down 
the beach together; maybe they are preparing to migrate?&nbsp; Lots of large 
shoals of small fish jumping so a delight to watch the Lesser Creaster Terns 
feeding.&nbsp; Best birding I have had at the beach for ages.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Today was delighted to wake to the sound of Carmine 
Bee-eaters feeding over Tudor Creek, a very rare event.&nbsp; What better way to 
start the week!</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Did anyone manage to ID Doris's duck?&nbsp; Best 
guess I could come up with was Northern Shoveler.&nbsp; Would love to hear from 
some more expert birder.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Have heard there has been a sighting of an 
Albatross around Likoni and just got a text from a Shanzu resident that it has 
been seen there.&nbsp; He was IDing it as a 'Wandering" but according to book 
that seems unlikely.&nbsp; Anyone on Birdsnet at the Coast - please keep an eye 
open and a bino ready.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
