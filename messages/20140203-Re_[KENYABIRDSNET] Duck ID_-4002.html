<div class="moz-text-flowed">Hi Brian,
<br>
<br>Yes... Have also looked at it a bit more as well and whilst the first 
image has more the jizz of a White-backed, in fact the second image is 
less so and your comments on the detail of the plumage make a lot of sense!

<br><blockquote type=cite>Hi Colin,
<br>I must admit that I did not spend much time with the duck image, so I
<br>downloaded it again and had another look. I still came to the same
<br>thoughts though, that of a young White-faced Whistling Duck.
<br>My reasons were that on looking at Doris's images, a White-backed that
<br>age would be showing signs of tiger-banding on back and probably on
<br>the flanks. This bird shows a uniform back with no indication of any
<br>pattern forming, even the rump should be barred for White-backed.
<br>White-backed ducklings still show a white blaze at the base of the
<br>bill from an early age (younger than this bird) like adults, but there
<br>is no sign of this here. White-backed have pale underparts but with
<br>dark barring, but already the unmarked dark maroon breast of WFWD is
<br>present on this bird. The flanks show the start of the fine barring on
<br>each breast feather of WFWD, that at a distance look vermiculated,
<br>White-backs progress from uniform flanks to banded, but not
<br>vermiculated. On the image of the bird out of the water, you can see
<br>the pattern of WFWD more clearly.
<br>The images also give the impression of a bird having been diving, but
<br>young Whistling Ducks habitually dive for food but maybe less
<br>elegantly than a normal diving duck.
<br>That it why I still opt for the WFWD option,
<br>Best for now
