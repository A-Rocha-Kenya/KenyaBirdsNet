<div dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:12.571428298950195px">Dear friends,</span><div style="font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:12.571428298950195px"><br></div><div style="font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:12.571428298950195px">
I was horrified today to see that KWS have started fencing off a huge piece of the Nairobi National Park for the major expansion of the Nairobi Orphanage.  See attached photo. The fence follows the main road from the entrance all the way to the club house - which is almost to the ivory burn site.</div>
<div style="font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:12.571428298950195px"><br></div><div style="font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:12.571428298950195px">I am writing to request that you help me to demand an immediate halt these plans. I have identified the following arguments;  you may have others</div>
<div style="font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:12.571428298950195px"><br></div><div style="font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:12.571428298950195px">1. Expanding the orphanage violates the very original purpose of the orphanage - to home orphans and act as a half way house before they are released.  The orphanage was never intended as a zoo which is what it seems KWS wants to create. The Safari Walk on the other hand was created as a zoo - there is no need for two zoos in the same place in Nairobi. Moreover, wilderness in the National Park should not be sacrificed for the creation of or expansion of a zoo,  instead a wholesome education experience through visitation to the park should be promoted as it  is far more valuable.</div>
<div style="font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:12.571428298950195px"><br></div><div style="font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:12.571428298950195px">  </div><div style="font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:12.571428298950195px">
2. The area for expansion will require the destruction of a sizeable piece of Nairobi Park.  We are not aware of any EIA having been conducted, nor are we aware of any stakeholder consultation having taken place. As you know, FoNNaP which is 19 years old, has always defended the park and although our board meets regularly with the warden, there has been no consultation of these plans, and we have not been informed of these or any other plans for developments in the park. </div>
<div style="font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:12.571428298950195px"><br></div><div style="font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:12.571428298950195px">3. We believe that these developments are in violation of the management plan of the park which is already out of date having expired a few years ago. It is also therefore a violation of the new Act which requires parks to have management plans that are developed through a  stakeholder consultative process. </div>
<div style="font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:12.571428298950195px"><br></div><div style="font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:12.571428298950195px">4. The area of land that is being fenced off will result in the destruction of  highly endangered tropical highland forest including habitats for endangered add endangered species, as well as  species of concern including lions, jackals, leopard, Crowned eagle (one of the only 2 nesting pairs in Nairobi nests in these trees), Suni, duiker, black rhino and forest hog all live in this part of the forest.  I am sure there are also plants, birds and other animals that will also be threatened. By degrading this habitat and alienating it from the park the KWS will be violating the EMCA, and failure to consult the stakeholders is in violation of the constitution.   </div>
<div style="font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:12.571428298950195px"><div><br></div><div>I have written to the Director KWS, NEMA Director and the CS to respectfully request the immediate halt to the ongoing fencing of the park, as it is not too late to restore any  damage already caused.  </div>
<div><br></div><div>I have also asked for an investigation to be initiated into how this proposal was developed and passed without any stakeholder consultation or EIA. </div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Please help by sending your own letter to the Cabinet Secretary, KWS Director (<a href="mailto:Director@kws.org">Director@kws.org</a>) and NEMA DG  &lt;<a href="mailto:gmwahungu@gmail.com">gmwahungu@gmail.com</a>&gt;on this issue so that they can see how serious this is. </div>
