Dear Paula and all,
This is horrifying, and shows why we have to keep an eye on actions
taken by KWS in all sorts of their underhand manners, as you said in
your previous correspondence they are so secretive in what they do. Of
course what they do is completely illegal, and it's time that the
conservationist minded public were fully aware of the mishandling of
Nairobi National Park. It's so difficult nowadays to write anything
complementary about KWS in Nairobi, but I suppose there must be
something somewhere.
