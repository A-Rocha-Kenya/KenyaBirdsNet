<BR>
City Park does it again! A very interesting record of a Scops Owl.<BR>
<BR>
Bill Harvey, in his Annotated Checklist of the Birds of Nairobi, 1997, has a record of African Scops Owl in the Arboretum. <BR>
<BR>
An African Scops Owl was rescued from Sukari Dam in Kiambu last year by the waterbird counters, and nursed back to health by Zoe Gibbs.<BR>
<BR>
Personally, I&#8217;ve only seen one Scops Owl in Nairobi. Many years ago a tiny, elongated Scops Owl roosted in my Nairobi Hill garden for a week or so, and as it was in this season, I assumed it to be a Eurasian Scops Owl.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks to Kiprono Chesire and Friends of City Park for this challenging record! Fleur <BR>
<BR>
