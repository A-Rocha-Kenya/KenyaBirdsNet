Hi Tom,
I believe that the Oribi came from the Krugers Farm at Eldoret some
years ago when the habitat was under threat. Oribi have not been a
native to the area, but of course are found both in the west and the
east where they are common at Kipini on the coast.
At least they are a native Kenyan mammal which cannot be said for White Rhino,
Best for now

I don't believe that Oribi are native in the Nairobi. They are present in
Mara (although possibly not common) and  certainly common in Ruma NP. It is
far from clear to me why they were introduced at all since unlike the
exotic south African White Rhino they are not globally threatened

PS: We seem to see far less Black Rhino in in NNP these days. A few years
ago ten in a morning was not unusual. Does anyone else have the same
experience?

Are Oribi Ourebia ourebi also an 'introduced species' to Nairobi National
Park?  I thought that this species was brought into NNP from SW Kenya (i.e.,
O. o. cottoni).

I am not aware of any earlier records of Oribi for the Nairobi area.  Are
there any such records?

Dear Paula and all,
This is horrifying, and shows why we have to keep an eye on actions
taken by KWS in all sorts of their underhand manners, as you said in
your previous correspondence they are so secretive in what they do. Of
course what they do is completely illegal, and it's time that the
conservationist minded public were fully aware of the mishandling of
Nairobi National Park. It's so difficult nowadays to write anything
complementary about KWS in Nairobi, but I suppose there must be
something somewhere.
From my own standpoint the integrity of Nairobi National Park as a
reserve for native wildlife was breached when (and I am sure only for
a tourist attraction) White Rhinos were introduced to the Park. As
Kenya has never been the home for these beasts, (which I am very fond
of by the way), they have as little right to call NNP home as House
Crows in Mombasa, they are an exotic, never native to Kenya and should
not have been introduced into what up to then was a natural ecosystem
as far as mammalian species were concerned.
Had the White Rhinos not had been introduced, we would probably not
have had the associated problems that we have now, with them being a
magnet to poachers. They can only bring us trouble and the time is now
to relocate them in a safe area elsewhere.

Do you know that on Sunday, with Fleur and some visitors, we were
birding along the Cheetah Gate Road. We have always been exceedingly
suspicious of the great area of land along the Mbagathi in that little
visited SE corner, being fenced off. Whilst I don't think that
anything honest from KWS has satisfactorily explained the fencing of
this portion of the Park, now the road to Cheetah Gate has been
blocked with the electric fence continuing across the road from the
Cement Factory. This definitely looks like an Illegal Excision of a
large part of the Park to me, what do others feel?

Then of course there is the mystery fence at the back of Hyena Dam,
another Excision?, and what about the Pylons????
Best to all
Brian

Dear friends,

I was horrified today to see that KWS have started fencing off a huge
piece
of the Nairobi National Park for the major expansion of the Nairobi
Orphanage. See attached photo. The fence follows the main road from the
entrance all the way to the club house - which is almost to the ivory
burn
site.

I am writing to request that you help me to demand an immediate halt
these
plans. I have identified the following arguments; you may have others

1. Expanding the orphanage violates the very original purpose of the
orphanage - to home orphans and act as a half way house before they are
released. The orphanage was never intended as a zoo which is what it
seems
KWS wants to create. The Safari Walk on the other hand was created as a
zoo
- there is no need for two zoos in the same place in Nairobi. Moreover,
wilderness in the National Park should not be sacrificed for the creation
of or expansion of a zoo, instead a wholesome education experience
through
visitation to the park should be promoted as it is far more valuable.


2. The area for expansion will require the destruction of a sizeable
piece
of Nairobi Park. We are not aware of any EIA having been conducted, nor
are we aware of any stakeholder consultation having taken place. As you
know, FoNNaP which is 19 years old, has always defended the park and
although our board meets regularly with the warden, there has been no
consultation of these plans, and we have not been informed of these or
any
other plans for developments in the park.

3. We believe that these developments are in violation of the management
plan of the park which is already out of date having expired a few years
ago. It is also therefore a violation of the new Act which requires parks
to have management plans that are developed through a stakeholder
consultative process.

4. The area of land that is being fenced off will result in the
destruction
of highly endangered tropical highland forest including habitats for
endangered add endangered species, as well as species of concern
including
lions, jackals, leopard, Crowned eagle (one of the only 2 nesting pairs
in
Nairobi nests in these trees), Suni, duiker, black rhino and forest hog
all
live in this part of the forest. I am sure there are also plants, birds
and other animals that will also be threatened. By degrading this habitat
and alienating it from the park the KWS will be violating the EMCA, and
failure to consult the stakeholders is in violation of the constitution.

I have written to the Director KWS, NEMA Director and the CS to
respectfully request the immediate halt to the ongoing fencing of the
park,
as it is not too late to restore any damage already caused.

I have also asked for an investigation to be initiated into how this
proposal was developed and passed without any stakeholder consultation or
EIA.


Please help by sending your own letter to the Cabinet Secretary, KWS
Director (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:Director@kws.org">Director@kws.org</a>) and NEMA DG <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:gmwahungu@gmail.com">&lt;gmwahungu@gmail.com&gt;</a>on this
issue
so that they can see how serious this is.


Kind Regards
