<div dir="ltr">Good news, the NEMA boss just called me to tell me that after an inspection they issued a stop order as no EIA or stakeholder consultation has taken place. Hopefully this is a new opportunity to engage with and support KWS in improvements - afterall we are their customers and the rightful owners of the park. &nbsp;&nbsp;<div>

<div><font size="4">&quot;While Kenya has not been a White Rhino range state in the 
last two <br>hundred years; evidence from fossils and cave paintings in Kenya 
and <br>northern Tanzania suggests that the White Rhinoceros, presumably similar 
<br>to the northern race (C. s. cottoni), was widespread and a part of the 
<br>East African savanna fauna until 3,000 years ago or less (M. Leakey 
<br>pers. comm.), when it was probably displaced by pastoralists who could 
<br>easily kill such tame animals (Brett RA [ed] 1993). This is based on the 
<br>White Rhino subfossil documented by Maeve Leakey from 3,000 year from 
<br>Rift Valley (Lake Nakuru area). Thus at one stage Kenya was once a White 
<br>Rhino range state (subspecies unknown) and hence the White Rhino as a 
<br>species but not C. s. simum as a subspecies has probably been 
<br>reintroduced to Kenya (with the latter being an introduction of a 
<br>probable out of range subspecies). A recent report of a white rhino 
<br>hunting trophy from Kenya in an Austrian Museum still has to be 
<br>confirmed but merits further investigation.&quot;</font></div>

  <p>Hi Tom,<br>I believe that the Oribi came from the Krugers Farm at Eldoret 
  some<br>years ago when the habitat was under threat. Oribi have not been 
  a<br>native to the area, but of course are found both in the west and 
  the<br>east where they are common at Kipini on the coast.<br>At least they are

  Re: [KENYABIRDSNET] URGENT: Nairobi Park forest and wildlife<br>&gt; 
  threatened by expansion of Orphanage<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Dear 
  Paula and all,<br>&gt; This is horrifying, and shows why we have to keep an 
  eye on actions<br>&gt; taken by KWS in all sorts of their underhand manners, 
  as you said in<br>&gt; your previous correspondence they are so secretive in 
  what they do. Of<br>&gt; course what they do is completely illegal, and it&#39;s 
  time that the<br>&gt; conservationist minded public were fully aware of the 
  mishandling of<br>&gt; Nairobi National Park. It&#39;s so difficult nowadays to 
  write anything<br>&gt; complementary about KWS in Nairobi, but I suppose there 
  must be<br>&gt; something somewhere.<br>&gt; From my own standpoint the 
  integrity of Nairobi National Park as a<br>&gt; reserve for native wildlife 
  was breached when (and I am sure only for<br>&gt; a tourist attraction) White 
  Rhinos were introduced to the Park. As<br>&gt; Kenya has never been the home 
  for these beasts, (which I am very fond<br>&gt; of by the way), they have as 
  little right to call NNP home as House<br>&gt; Crows in Mombasa, they are an 
  exotic, never native to Kenya and should<br>&gt; not have been introduced into 
  what up to then was a natural ecosystem<br>&gt; as far as mammalian species 
  were concerned.<br>&gt; Had the White Rhinos not had been introduced, we would 
  probably not<br>&gt; have had the associated problems that we have now, with 
  them being a<br>&gt; magnet to poachers. They can only bring us trouble and 
  the time is now<br>&gt; to relocate them in a safe area 
  elsewhere.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Do you know that on Sunday, with Fleur and some 
  visitors, we were<br>&gt; birding along the Cheetah Gate Road. We have always 
  been exceedingly<br>&gt; suspicious of the great area of land along the 
  Mbagathi in that little<br>&gt; visited SE corner, being fenced off. Whilst I 
  don&#39;t think that<br>&gt; anything honest from KWS has satisfactorily explained 
  the fencing of<br>&gt; this portion of the Park, now the road to Cheetah Gate 
  has been<br>&gt; blocked with the electric fence continuing across the road 
  from the<br>&gt; Cement Factory. This definitely looks like an Illegal 
  Excision of a<br>&gt; large part of the Park to me, what do others 
  feel?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Then of course there is the mystery fence at the back of 
  Hyena Dam,<br>&gt; another Excision?, and what about the Pylons????<br>&gt; 
  Best to all<br>&gt; Brian<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On 2/3/14, Paula Kahumbu 
  &lt;<a href="mailto:pkahumbu@gmail.com" target="_blank">pkahumbu@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; Dear 
  friends,<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I was horrified today to see that KWS have 
  started fencing off a huge<br>&gt;&gt; piece<br>&gt;&gt; of the Nairobi 
  National Park for the major expansion of the Nairobi<br>&gt;&gt; Orphanage. 
  See attached photo. The fence follows the main road from the<br>&gt;&gt; 
  entrance all the way to the club house - which is almost to the 
  ivory<br>&gt;&gt; burn<br>&gt;&gt; site.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I am writing 
  to request that you help me to demand an immediate halt<br>&gt;&gt; 
  these<br>&gt;&gt; plans. I have identified the following arguments; you may 
  have others<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 1. Expanding the orphanage violates the 
  very original purpose of the<br>&gt;&gt; orphanage - to home orphans and act 
  as a half way house before they are<br>&gt;&gt; released. The orphanage was 
  never intended as a zoo which is what it<br>&gt;&gt; seems<br>&gt;&gt; KWS 
  wants to create. The Safari Walk on the other hand was created as 
  a<br>&gt;&gt; zoo<br>&gt;&gt; - there is no need for two zoos in the same 
  place in Nairobi. Moreover,<br>&gt;&gt; wilderness in the National Park should 
  not be sacrificed for the creation<br>&gt;&gt; of or expansion of a zoo, 
  instead a wholesome education experience<br>&gt;&gt; through<br>&gt;&gt; 
  visitation to the park should be promoted as it is far more 
  valuable.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 2. The area for expansion will 
  require the destruction of a sizeable<br>&gt;&gt; piece<br>&gt;&gt; of Nairobi 
  Park. We are not aware of any EIA having been conducted, nor<br>&gt;&gt; are 
  we aware of any stakeholder consultation having taken place. As 
  you<br>&gt;&gt; know, FoNNaP which is 19 years old, has always defended the 
  park and<br>&gt;&gt; although our board meets regularly with the warden, there 
  has been no<br>&gt;&gt; consultation of these plans, and we have not been 
  informed of these or<br>&gt;&gt; any<br>&gt;&gt; other plans for developments 
  in the park.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 3. We believe that these developments are 
  in violation of the management<br>&gt;&gt; plan of the park which is already 
  out of date having expired a few years<br>&gt;&gt; ago. It is also therefore a 
  violation of the new Act which requires parks<br>&gt;&gt; to have management 
  plans that are developed through a stakeholder<br>&gt;&gt; consultative 
  process.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 4. The area of land that is being fenced off 
  will result in the<br>&gt;&gt; destruction<br>&gt;&gt; of highly endangered 
  tropical highland forest including habitats for<br>&gt;&gt; endangered add 
  endangered species, as well as species of concern<br>&gt;&gt; 
  including<br>&gt;&gt; lions, jackals, leopard, Crowned eagle (one of the only 
  2 nesting pairs<br>&gt;&gt; in<br>&gt;&gt; Nairobi nests in these trees), 
  Suni, duiker, black rhino and forest hog<br>&gt;&gt; all<br>&gt;&gt; live in 
  this part of the forest. I am sure there are also plants, birds<br>&gt;&gt; 
  and other animals that will also be threatened. By degrading this 
  habitat<br>&gt;&gt; and alienating it from the park the KWS will be violating 
  the EMCA, and<br>&gt;&gt; failure to consult the stakeholders is in violation 
  of the constitution.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I have written to the Director 
  KWS, NEMA Director and the CS to<br>&gt;&gt; respectfully request the 
  immediate halt to the ongoing fencing of the<br>&gt;&gt; park,<br>&gt;&gt; as 
  it is not too late to restore any damage already 
  caused.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I have also asked for an investigation to be 
  initiated into how this<br>&gt;&gt; proposal was developed and passed without 
  any stakeholder consultation or<br>&gt;&gt; 
  EIA.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Please help by sending your own 
  letter to the Cabinet Secretary, KWS<br>&gt;&gt; Director (<a href="mailto:Director@kws.org" target="_blank">Director@kws.org</a>) 
  and NEMA DG &lt;<a href="mailto:gmwahungu@gmail.com" target="_blank">gmwahungu@gmail.com</a>&gt;on this<br>&gt;&gt; issue<br>&gt;&gt;
