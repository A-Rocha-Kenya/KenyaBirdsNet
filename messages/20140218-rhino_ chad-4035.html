"..A recent report of a white rhino hunting trophy from Kenya in an Austrian Museum still has to be 
confirmed but merits further investigation..."

Hi Tom, could you let me know a bit more about this trophy? Our aristocracy was quite the same (Austro-Hungary), and I know the hunting history here very much, so maybe it would recall something from my mind :))

On a different note I am just back from Chad, and I am sure there are some linkminded people in Kenya who might be interested in, it was one of my finest trips ever, its a heaven on Earth, a must for anyone who wants to see the old Africa at its best.

The Safaritalk link is here, my post is # 23
