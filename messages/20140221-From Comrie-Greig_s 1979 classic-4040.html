  face=Arial>--------------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>Leuthold 
  (1977) records several such instances of unsuccessful <BR>mammalian 
  translocation, which he attempts to explain in terms of <BR>behavioural 
  characteristics (lack of social cohesion, lack of <BR>familiarity with home 
  range, etc.). It is possible, however, that <BR>genetic factors played a part. 
  The cases recorded by Leuthold are: some <BR>Uganda kob translocated from 
  western Kenya to the Mara Game Reserve<BR>around 1963 have not been recorded 
  recently; a number of giraffe moved <BR>from western to north-central Kenya in 
  1967/8 dispersed and are now <BR>unaccounted for; some 35 roan antelope taken 
  to the Shimba Hills Reserve <BR>in 1969 decreased by 1974 to 12 and now lead a 
  'very tenuous existence'; <BR>the latter also applies to some Hunter's 
  hartebeest and Grevy's zebras <BR>introduced into Tsavo National Park in 1963. 
  Disappointments such as <BR>these should be more often recorded in print but 
  when it comes to <BR>failures, human nature is an effective censor.<BR><BR>It 
  is pleasing to record that the latest Grevy's zebra (Equus grevyz) 
  <BR>'rescue' operation in Kenya has been severely criticized (Reader 1979). 
  <BR>The translocation to Tsavo, beyond their natural range, is 
  <BR>scientifically unjustifiable, and has been attended by extensive 
  <BR>mortality. The professional game-catcher, Don Hunt, is quoted as<BR>saying 
  that there was not time for the scientific evaluation of the <BR>translocation 
  - 'We don't need scientists to tell us that zebras eat <BR>grass.' (Reader op. 
  cit.).<BR></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></FONT></BODY></HTML>
