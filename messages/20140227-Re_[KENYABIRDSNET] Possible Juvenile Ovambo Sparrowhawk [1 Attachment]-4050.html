Hi Mwema<br>
I think it's an imm Great Sparrowhawk for it has tear drop like markings
on the belly.<br>
I'd be happy to know whatever your bird is though.<br>
Cheers<br>

Hello Birders,<br>
I encountered this sparrowhawk two weeks ago at Wasini Island as it tried
to catch a chicken. I identified it as a Juvenile Ovambo Sparrowhawk
mainly due to the prominent eye stripe, dark eyes. I was not able to get
a good look at the toes. Can anyone confirm my id? I don't know if there
are many sightings of this species from the coast, it's definitely my
first at the coast.<br>
Best,<br>
Martin<br>
