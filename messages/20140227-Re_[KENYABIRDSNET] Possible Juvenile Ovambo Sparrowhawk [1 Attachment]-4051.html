Hi Martin,

Looks like Great Sparrowhawk to me. Get the impression of a huge
accipiter (I may be wrong). Likely female, Black Sparrowhawk because
of the mostly brown plumage on dorsal body. Also blotchy pattern
rather than streaks, 'arrowheads' (which I suppose you'd see in the
Ovampo). claw is tricky in field; many accipiters all seem 'baseball
glove configured' (long mid toe). Any views of the upper tail marking?
rows of white arrow-marks along the tail (not sure if at this stage
they'd be showng)?

Humble regards
Martin

Hello Birders,
I encountered this sparrowhawk two weeks ago at Wasini Island as it tried to
catch a chicken. I identified it as a Juvenile Ovambo Sparrowhawk mainly due
to the prominent eye stripe, dark eyes. I was not able to get a good look at
the toes. Can anyone confirm my id? I don't know if there are many sightings
of this species from the coast, it's definitely my first at the coast.

Best,
Martin
