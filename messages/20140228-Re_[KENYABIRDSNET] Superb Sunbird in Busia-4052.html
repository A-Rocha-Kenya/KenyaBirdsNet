Hi Chege,
And a very Happy New Year to you. The Mumias Piapiacs are still on the
rubbish tip?
In the past before the wholesale destruction of the habitat, I used to
see Superb Sunbird at Mungatsi with some regularity. The last Superb I
have seen in Kenya is at Alupe where there is still a lot of habitat
suitable for them, but that sighting was four years ago, and I don't
think there has been one recorded in Kenya since.
Best for now
Brian

Hi all
Just to report that while guiding for Exotic Birding on 1 Dec at
river Mungatsi we had a male Superb Sunbird. The dark maroon on the
belly to side running down the flanks were quite visible especially
when the bird came out in the light. We had him for about a dozen
minutes and occasionally he came out to the sunlight otherwise bigger
portion of the time spent watching him, he fed right inside the tree
bushes where canopy seemed thick. Frequently he raised a blue crest
kind off at the back from the top of the nape reminding me the old
punk hairstyle. Non of us had brought the camera on the walk but at
lunch having picnic i went back to the same place and spend about
30min in search but in vain.

Same day we had 2 Piapiacs at Mumias and the previous day we had a
Black-billed Turaco in Kakamega Forest

Cheers and best wishes for the year 2014
chege
