Hi Brian <br>
Nice to hear from you and thanks for your notes on the sunbird. <br>
Yes the Piapiacs are still in the rubbish is in Mumia.....just around the
town opposite the the Mumias Sugar Company's main gate. They were two
though.<br><br>
Great spotting of the Lesser Jacanas. Two year ago they had chicks in
Molo and in fact now seen twice with chicks. Then the open farm past your
jacana dam last year in August had a Red-chested Flufftail<br>
Good day <br>

And a very Happy New Year to you. The Mumias Piapiacs are still on
the<br>
rubbish tip?<br>
In the past before the wholesale destruction of the habitat, I used
to<br>
see Superb Sunbird at Mungatsi with some regularity. The last Superb
I<br>
have seen in Kenya is at Alupe where there is still a lot of habitat<br>
suitable for them, but that sighting was four years ago, and I don't<br>
think there has been one recorded in Kenya since.<br>
Best for now<br>

&gt; Hi all<br>
&gt; Just to report that while guiding for Exotic Birding on 1 Dec
at<br>
&gt; river Mungatsi we had a male Superb Sunbird. The dark maroon on
the<br>
&gt; belly to side running down the flanks were quite visible
especially<br>
&gt; when the bird came out in the light. We had him for about a
dozen<br>
&gt; minutes and occasionally he came out to the sunlight otherwise
bigger<br>
&gt; portion of the time spent watching him, he fed right inside the
tree<br>
&gt; bushes where canopy seemed thick. Frequently he raised a blue
crest<br>
&gt; kind off at the back from the top of the nape reminding me the
old<br>
&gt; punk hairstyle. Non of us had brought the camera on the walk but
at<br>
&gt; lunch having picnic i went back to the same place and spend
about<br>
&gt; 30min in search but in vain.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Same day we had 2 Piapiacs at Mumias and the previous day we had
a<br>
&gt; Black-billed Turaco in Kakamega Forest<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Cheers and best wishes for the year 2014<br>
