Dear Brian,<div><br><div>A depressing and distressing video in equal measure, but thanks for sharing it.</div><div><br></div><div>In many countries where White Storks breed they are welcomed by farmers and villagers alike. &nbsp;Local communities often consider it as a sign of good luck for Storks to breed close-by, and takes steps to protect them, &nbsp;Some even erect nesting platforms to attract them.</div><div><br></div><div>It is regrettable that a relatively small number of mis-guided people in certain countries, particularly along flyways in the Mediterranean region (but elsewhere too) choose to act is such a selfish and irresponsible manner. &nbsp;This most sickening thing is that there is absolutely no justification for such destructive shooting. &nbsp;In many cases, it is carried out solely for so-called &#39;fun&#39;.</div><div><br></div><div>Those involved with avian species within CMS (www.cms.int) are deeply concerned about the threat to migratory birds from illegal shooting and trapping. &nbsp;It is an issue that will be raised at the forthcoming 11th Conference of Parties to CMS later in the year. &nbsp;120 countries have now ratified CMS and we will be seeking their governments to do more to address this serious problem.</div><div><br></div><div>The EC Birds Directive has been in place for almost 35 years, yet there remains a significant problem in certain countries within the European Union. &nbsp;This demonstrates the scale of the challenge. &nbsp;However, such knowledge must simply harden our resolve to do more to develop and facilitate alliances between governments, NGOs and other stakeholders to address the problem. &nbsp;We must also actively engage with responsible hunting organisations and encourage them to assert peer pressure and to promote the introduction of basic ethical standards everywhere.</div><div><br></div><div>In a world of increasingly urbanised human populations, we must seize every opportunity to enlighten people about the eco-system benefits and the intrinsic value of birds and other species. &nbsp;Every voice counts and has the capacity to positively influence others.</div><div><br></div><div>Like Brian, let&#39;s all keep speaking up for wildlife - we really can&#39;t live without it.</div><div><br></div><div>Best regards,</div><div><br></div><div>NPW</div><div><br></div></div></body>
