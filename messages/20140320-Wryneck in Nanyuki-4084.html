<p dir="ltr">Saw a red throated wryneck on the grounds of Cape chestnut should anyone want to try to see her / him. Had a mountain greenbul also at our place at burguret which was a first for our list there. <br>
On the subject of storks I forgot to report the incredible numbers I saw during the 10 to 4 Mt bike race. Thousands roosting in the ngare ndare and foraging in the wheat by day. I hope their stay with our brothers in Lebanon goes ok but I must say i still dismay after seeing videos like the one Bryan shared. Cheers jamie</p>
