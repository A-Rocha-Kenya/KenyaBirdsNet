Dear Martin,
This is a fantastic record, not because it is a Beaudouin's but
because it is an immature Beaudouin's. Two years ago at this exact
time, I had a dependent juvenile with an adult at Nambale. There were
two adults in the area, and presumably constituted a pair. The fact
that a begging young was with one of them meant that it was locally
bred, and constituted the first time ever in Eastern Africa, and the
immature the first to be found in Eastern Africa.
Now your bird is in first plumage, my bird from two years ago has
probably changed considerably in plumage by now, and I think that this
is strongly suggestive that Beaudouin's has bred in the area again.
Well done for identifying a plumage that is incorrect in most of the
bird literature,
Best for now
Brian

This is today's record. C. beaudouini certainly turning up more frequently
than C. pectoralis at Bunyala Rice Scheme, western kenya.
(NB: Even my older,-not so old; from 2011- poorer images on closer
examination are disappontingly then again excitingly more of beaudouini
than pectoralis)

Humble regards
