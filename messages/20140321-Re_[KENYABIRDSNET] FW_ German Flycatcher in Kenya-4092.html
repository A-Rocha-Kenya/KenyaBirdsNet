Hi Titus,
This is very interesting. The people to know of any other indication
that Spotted Flycatchers from Europe come to Kenya, and maybe beyond
would be David Pearson and Graeme Backhurst. You should contact them
direct with this info and see if they can show any more evidence that
this has occurred before. I think that although the species is due
back in Europe within the next few weeks, the bulk of the Spotted
Flycatchers from south are yet to pass through, and will peak late
March early April,
Best for now
Brian

Hello,

Titus, thank you for the information about the Spotted (German) Flycatcher
in Kenya. Did you get in touch with the German ringing group? And with the
ring number they would know when it was ringed and at what age.

As you know Spotted Flycatchers in the UK are often seen. You can also send
this information to RSPB and BTO.

Happy birding.

Shailesh

Dear all,

While working on Guineafowls on Mpala Ranch in Laikipia, We captured two
Spotted Flycatchers in the same mist net. With careful look we realized
that
one had a ring on its leg. It was a German Ring Number 9N04470, Helgoland,
Germany. After releasing the birds, they remained in the same area the rest
of the day, and captured 3 times in the day.  The fact that it is March and
migrants are expected back in Europe in a few weeks time, both the birds
had
hardly enough fat deposits ready to head back home. GPS reading, UTM, 26 25
18,  43 0 47 156 EURO South. at an altitude of 1695 m above sea level.

Kind regards,

Titus
