That's always a nice bird to see Titus, look forward to your full

Laikipia!
Best for now

Saw a red throated wryneck on the grounds of Cape chestnut should anyone
want to try to see her / him. Had a mountain greenbul also at our place at
burguret which was a first for our list there.
On the subject of storks I forgot to report the incredible numbers I saw
during the 10 to 4 Mt bike race. Thousands roosting in the ngare ndare and
foraging in the wheat by day. I hope their stay with our brothers in Lebanon
goes ok but I must say i still dismay after seeing videos like the one Bryan
shared. Cheers jamie
