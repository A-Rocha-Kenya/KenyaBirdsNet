 cranes on friday while on their way to the dam for a night. sawaiti on the other site did not give us any flamingo but other birds like ducks, cranes, egrets, plovers and a few warder plenty. both site were great for birds.<br><br>Regards <br>Chesire Dominic<br></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
