Thanks Clive,
I will ask Itai if there are actual faces on the originals, and then
we can make them more famous! There is a Lebanon Hunters web-site
which when I get some time I will go into and see if I can find the
orginal images there,
Best for now
Brian

Agreed, but we are dealing with something we have no control over.
Presumably the perpetrators ensure their faces are blurred out, or am I
wrong? Certainly when you see such atrocities from other countries the
perpetrators seem very proud to show their faces.

Dear All,
Apologies to Itai, but I stole the latest Lebanese White Stork
atrocities off his Facebook.

My point is this, what is the legality that prevents the actual image
of the person committing the crime from being shown in images. Why
does it have to be blurred when the culprit is caught red (bloody)
handed?

It seems wrong to show them a courtousy they don't deserve. If the
persons image is shown, and they try to sue for some reason, then this
will bring the horror further out into the limelight.

Best for now

Brian
