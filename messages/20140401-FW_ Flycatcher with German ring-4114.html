Dear All,<BR>
Two weeks ago I reported Spotted Flycatcher ringed with german ring. This was captured immediately the net was set in the morning. Point of CORRECTION, it was African Grey Flycatcher With a GERMAN RING. Even though it was that much early in the morning, I was carried away by the ring and paid less attention( Attention To Details). i know what horror it has been to my fellow birders and apologize. What a lesson. I think this is the second time I have found foreign ring &nbsp;on Mpala. I am sure other have experienced same, may at the place or other places. The first was an American ring some 6 years ago. The better part of that was that it had only a numbers but the country. We shared this with the BC and agreed that there will a communication especially at different sites that receive researchers working on birds. I think as Colin is working on permitting issues, it is time to have some policies which can always check on this problem and others.<BR>
<BR>
Thank you so much Graeme and others.<BR>
<BR>
ATD in birding always.<BR>

Dear Fleur and Brian,<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for passing this on Fleur.<BR>
<BR>
Just a few points: the bird concerned was actually an African Grey Flycatcher which had been ringed, using a German Helgoland ring, on 20.01.2008 at Impala Ranch. Bernard [Amakiobe] was given this info on 24 March by Gerhard Nikolaus who kindly obtained it from the Helgoland scheme in Wilhelmshaven.<BR>
<BR>
The ring being inscribed Helgoland does not necessarily mean that a bird wearing such a ring was ringed on the island! Most birds with Nairobi rings were not ringed in Nairobi . . .<BR>
<BR>
What a pity all this incorrect information was circulated so widely.<BR>
<BR>
I have purposelessly not copied this letter to all and sundry nor to kenyabirdsnet; it's now up to Titus to set the record straight. &nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
It is exceedingly bad manners to use foreign rings without permission in a country with its own ringing scheme. [Stockholm rings have been used at Ngulia since 1990, but with the approval of the ringing organizer and the Swedish ringing centre.]<BR>
<BR>
Best wishes,<BR>
<BR>
Graeme<BR>
