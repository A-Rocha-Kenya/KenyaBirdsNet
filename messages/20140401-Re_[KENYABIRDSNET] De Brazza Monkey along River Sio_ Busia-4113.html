Dear George,
They are still at Nambale on the Sio, including some really impressive
males. I have seen them also west of Mungatsi in the past but the
habitat is gone. You might also be interested in that there is still a
population of Patas at the research station at Alupe.
Best for now
Brian

I
have a student who plans to carry out her thesis work on cryptic De Brazza
monkey  along River Sio, around Mungatsi
area and in Busia generally. The student basically wants to understand the
current population status of this small sub-population and edge effects,
other threats, (loss of riparian vegetation and other habitats,
hunting, culture etc) and community attitudes towards its conservation.

I
remember seeing this species a few years ago at Mungatsi. Has anyone of you
seen it recently and anywhere within the  Busia grasslands area. Any
documentation on the species from that area is also welcome. Please share
with
us.
<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:eshiamwatagw@yahoo.co.uk">eshiamwatagw@yahoo.co.uk</a>  and the student is <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:ojujud@yahoo.com">ojujud@yahoo.com</a>

Kindly
let us know.

Thank
you.
