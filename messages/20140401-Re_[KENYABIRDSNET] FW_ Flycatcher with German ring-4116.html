Thanks very much for this Titus. Foreigners using their own rings on
our birds here is certainly not permissible,except maybe with the
exception of colour rings in population studies.

Very grateful for the information now put to right, although the
original story of a Spotted Flycatcher from Germany would have been
far more interesting!

Very best for now
Brian

But at least we know that the gemans don't know how to spell heligoland!

Subject: Re: Flycatcher with German ring

Dear All,
Two weeks ago I reported Spotted Flycatcher ringed with german ring. This
was captured immediately the net was set in the morning. Point of
CORRECTION, it was African Grey Flycatcher With a GERMAN RING. Even though
it was that much early in the morning, I was carried away by the ring and
paid less attention( Attention To Details). i know what horror it has been
to my fellow birders and apologize. What a lesson. I think this is the
second time I have found foreign ring  on Mpala. I am sure other have
experienced same, may at the place or other places. The first was an
American ring some 6 years ago. The better part of that was that it had
only
a numbers but the country. We shared this with the BC and agreed that there
will a communication especially at different sites that receive researchers
working on birds. I think as Colin is working on permitting issues, it is
time to have some policies which can always check on this problem and
others.

Thank you so much Graeme and others.

ATD in birding always.

Titus

Flycatcher with German ring

Dear Fleur and Brian,

Thanks for passing this on Fleur.

Just a few points: the bird concerned was actually an African Grey
Flycatcher which had been ringed, using a German Helgoland ring, on
20.01.2008 at Impala Ranch. Bernard [Amakiobe] was given this info on 24
March by Gerhard Nikolaus who kindly obtained it from the Helgoland scheme
in Wilhelmshaven.

The ring being inscribed Helgoland does not necessarily mean that a bird
wearing such a ring was ringed on the island! Most birds with Nairobi rings
were not ringed in Nairobi . . .

What a pity all this incorrect information was circulated so widely.

I have purposelessly not copied this letter to all and sundry nor to
kenyabirdsnet; it's now up to Titus to set the record straight.

It is exceedingly bad manners to use foreign rings without permission in a
country with its own ringing scheme. [Stockholm rings have been used at
Ngulia since 1990, but with the approval of the ringing organizer and the
Swedish ringing centre.]

Best wishes,

Graeme
