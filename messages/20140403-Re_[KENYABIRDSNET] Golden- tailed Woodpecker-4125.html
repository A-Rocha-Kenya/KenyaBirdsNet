Dear Mwangi,
This is another fantastic find. It has such a distinctive loud and
frequent call, that I cannot see that it has been living in Nairobi
undetected.

Unlike the Karen Blixen Museum bird (I have only seen the adult
female), this Racecourse bird is an immature, so the markings are less
distinct but they are there. (I have seen Peter Ushers photo of the
bird).

So exciting and so very unexpected. Also good to hear that the juv
Crowned Eagle is in a healthy state,

Best for now
Brian

Dear All, During yesterday's Nature Kenya Wednesday Bird walk  at Ngong Race
course we saw the above mentioned Bird,we had a very good view and the call
was very distinct,
 Another exciting sighting was the Juvenile Crowned Eagle perching next to
its nest.


 Enjoy Birding,
 Mwangi.
