<p>And this is only because we are sticking to the species concept instead of evolutionary significant units, see for example on white-eyes</p>

They are very far from each other and separated by what is euphemistically named the "mixed maize farming system" (to me a farming system would assume some level of sustainability.) There cannot be any gene flow with their west-african colleagues across its very wide range. These things will not move even if you set fire to the forest and they will eventually disappear as fragmentation and unmanagement continue. </p>

<div class="y_msg_container">Dear All;    Tom Butynski has raised an important point regarding <br />&gt; species that have very restricted ranges, in some cases known from <br />&gt; only a single National Park or other protected or semi-protected <br />&gt; area.  This applies to all three countries, and I feel that where we <br />&gt; have that situation, if the populations of those restricted species <br />&gt; is considered stable, then they might best be considered Vulnerable, <br />&gt; and only when we see those populations actually decreasing would they <br />&gt; qualify for the Endangered category.  All the species that Tom <br />&gt; listed from Uganda would I feel best be considered Vulnerable for the <br />&gt; time being.  The same applies to several Kenya and Tanzania species <br />&gt; that have very restricted ranges, but those that I have listed do <br />&gt; already qualify for the Globally Endangered Category by Birdlife <br />&gt; International, so they had to be included.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; For details of those species that at the time I placed in Categories <br />&gt; A-E for the three East African countries please refer to my article <br />&gt; in Scopus 32 (2013) pp 27-34. I did list all species that have been <br />&gt; extirpated from the three EA countries ( Category D).<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Tom also raises the question of Saker Falcon which is treated by <br />&gt; BirdLife as a Globally Endangered species, but which is only a <br />&gt; vagrant to us, and the three East African countries are not <br />&gt; considered a regular wintering area.  That is why for migratory <br />&gt; species I only included Madagascar Squacco Heron, Basra Reed Watbler <br />&gt; and Spotted Ground Thrush all of which winter almost exclusively with <br />&gt; us.  For the time species I have not considered any vagrant species <br />&gt; for the endangered list simply as it would take attention away from <br />&gt; those resident ones that need our urgent attention  (I'm not really <br />&gt; sure what we in East Africa can do to help the Saker Falcon).<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Please keep the questions coming and keep the debate alive.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Thanks and best wishes<br />&gt; Don<br />&gt; -- <br />&gt; <br />&gt; <br />&gt;</div>
