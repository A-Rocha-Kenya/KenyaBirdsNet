NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 28th APRIL 2014

Dear All,
On 28th April, Heather Elkins, Jennifer Oduori, Karen Plumbe and
myself, met up at Langata Gate to Nairobi National Park at 6.30am. We
were soon processed and headed into the Park. It had been a clear
night, but with a very heavy dew, and was a beautiful blue-sky sunny
morning, although clouded mid-morning and once this cleared became a
very warm day.

Firstly we took the left turn for the glade and continued on to the
dam. There were seven Crowned Cranes here dancing and cavorting, and
an African Jacana still present and the Little Grebe minus its hippo
throne. The marsh caused by the construction of the road still had a
few Wood Sandpipers, and amongst the forest birds was a noisy Emerald
Cuckoo. At the Langata Dam was another African Jacana, which was also
a long stayer, and the third today was the longest resident of all, at
Eland Hollow.
Passing Nagalomon Dam it was very quiet, there were three Darters but
that was all, apart from a pair of Spotted Thick-knees on the drift.

Ivory Burning Site still held on to an Olivaceous Warbler in the
Acacia gerardii, and Brown Parisoma was also present. Along the back
road to the new swamp it was quiet but we had out first of eight
Willow Warblers, there were plenty of Red-collared and Jacksonâ€™s
Widowbirds, and White-winged Widowbirds have arrived back and are
suddenly all over the Park. The swamp had African Water Rails and
eight Wood Sandpipers whilst a Black Crake there had a chick.</pre></div></body>
