      <p>Greetings birders<br>
<br>
In April a two-week bird survey was carried out in Boni and Dodori National<br>
Reserves and the Awer Community Conservancy between them, in the extreme<br>
eastern corner of Kenya. The expedition was led by John Musina of the<br>
National Museums of Kenya, sponsored by the Zoological Society of London,<br>
and coordinated by World Wide Fund for Nature, in partnership with National<br>
Museums of Kenya, Kenya Wildlife Service, Northern Rangelands Trust, A Rocha<br>
Kenya and Nature Kenya.<br>
 <br>
The Boni and Dodori National Reserves and Awer Community Conservancy<br>
comprise diverse habitats, ranging from coastal forest, dense thicket and<br>
acacia woodland to a scenic mosaic of palm savanna, grassland and groves of<br>
trees and shrubs. Small seasonal and semi-permanent wetlands dot the sandy<br>
landscape, and now, in the rainy season, much of the area is likely to<br>
become extensively flooded. African Fish Eagles turned up in nearly every<br>
habitat in April, presumably anticipating the rains.<br>
 <br>
Boni-Dodori is proposed as an Important Bird Area, as it shelters<br>
populations of threatened bird species as well as 16 of the 30 species of<br>
the East African Coast biome. The threatened birds seen in April include -<br>
Near-threatened: Southern Banded Snake Eagle, Bateleur, Crowned Eagle,<br>
Martial Eagle, Fischer¹s Turaco, Plain-backed Sunbird, Malindi Pipit and<br>
Eurasian Roller. Vulnerable: Lappet-faced and White-headed Vultures.<br>
Endangered: Basra Reed Warblers on migration.<br>
<br>
Birding highlights included seeing the brilliant all-red Juba race of the<br>
Red-headed Weaver building a nest in the village, and many males of the<br>
white-bellied race of the Variable Sunbird feeding on Combretum flowers;<br>
comparing Northern Brownbuls and Terrestrial Brownbuls caught in mist nets;<br>
and watching Amur Falcons, Eurasian Hobbies and Eurasian Rollers flying<br>
north in large numbers.<br>
 <br>
Over 225 species of birds were seen, heard or caught in mist-nets, ringed<br>
and released. These included characteristic coastal forest birds such as<br>
Forest Batis, Tiny Greenbul and Red-tailed Ant Thrush. The mystery of the<br>
Red-naped Bush Shrike with no (or hardly any) red nape was investigated;<br>
three birds were caught and photos, measurements and tissue samples taken.<br>
<br>
This new IBA, however, is already under threat. There is a land rush,<br>
because of the area¹s proximity to the LAPSSET project. Oil and gas deposits<br>
have been found offshore, in the area of Kiangwe. A wide new road is being<br>
cleared through the Dodori National Reserve.<br>
 <br>
To protect their land and resources, the Awer (Boni) people set up the Awer<br>
Community Conservancy with help from the Northern Rangelands Trust. WWF is<br>
working with the Awer people on livelihood improvement and habitat<br>
conservation. The Awer people, NGOs and government conservation agencies,<br>
however, now face an uphill struggle to mitigate the threats that come with<br>
the land rush.<br>
<br>
Wishing you good birding, Fleur<br>
 <br>
