NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 6th May 2014


Dear All,
On 6th May, Heather Elkins, Adam Kennedy and myself met up at the Main
Gate to Nairobi National Park about 6.45am, and Karen Plumbe kindly
provided the transport for our full day in the Park.

It had not rained overnight, but the roads were terrible with jams on
both Magadi Road and Langata Road, causing our late arrival. We
entered the gate and went to KWS Mess, primarily for Suni for Adam, as
it turned out as a very rare event, there were no signs of Suni, and
no birds of interest apart from a pair of Pale Flycatchers. Ivory
Burning Site was equally uninteresting, there was an Emerald Cuckoo en
route, and a strange sight here was a Suni!!!!

By now it was very overcast and dull, and starting to sprinkle, it
continued like this on and off for much of the day, clearing
mid-afternoon, and there was a heavy downpour as we left Eland Hollow.

In the drift at Nagalomon Dam were a pair of Spotted Thicknees, whilst
at the dam were another three. Also here there were two Darters, a
Squacco Heron, Yellow-billed Duck, a female Little Sparrowhawk flew
through, a single Swamphen fed along the edge, but the prize was a
female Painted-snipe.
