    <div class="moz-cite-prefix">Dear Adam<br>
      <br>
      This is my first posting on KenyaBirdNet, but I would like to
      encourage you to be a more open about this. I dabble on the edge
      of science and do a lot of investigating into African birds,
      including looking a museum specimens, and unfortunately there is
      nothing nearly as good and useful for sorting out complex issues
      as specimens, especially when collected together with DNA from
      known individuals. Photos are not suitable for capturing all the
      nuances of bird plumage, and its impossible to take photos in a
      controlled enough situation to to make proper comparisons later. <br>
      <br>
      The vast majority of forest birds that are particularly confusing
      and interesting - illadopsis, greenbuls, sunbirds and such like -
      are in fact rather common and even taking a couple of hundred of
      each species spread across several sites in Tanzania is not going
      to really going to drive any species closer to extinction. Birds
      are continually replacing themselves through reproduction and
      where there are vacant territories in suitable habitat they will
      be replaced quite quickly. I think the vast majority of
      populations of montane forest birds are habitat-limited rather
      than limited by the removal of individual birds. Of course there
      is a handful of very rare species (Dapple-throat, perhaps some
      Alethes, Long-billed Forest Warbler, etc) where sampling for
      scientific purposes might actually affect populations, but these
      are very much the exception. In this case - certainly for
      Endangered and Critically Endangered species - I think there would
      need to be very special justification for collecting any
      individuals.<br>
      <br>
      Also, I think it is important to remember that the work the Jon
      Fjeldsa and colleagues has been doing has opened up our
      understanding of the diversification of forest birds in this
      region and is the basis for sound conservation. You might feel
      that enough sampling has been done, but Tanzania's mountains are
      so complex and varied that really there is a long way still to go
      before a complete picture exists. Without a complete picture we
      cannot know where our conservation priorities lie.<br>
      <br>
      In this day and age there is a little bit of over-reaction to any
      form of killing. When its done in a planned manner with specific
      questions in mind I think we generally stand to gain from the
      exercise. Personally I'm useless at killing and of course I don't
      like the idea of it, but I think it takes courage and clear
      thinking to knowingly kill. I doubt Jon or his colleagues enjoy
      killing, but they know the advantages it has.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, I don't think you can equate killing a few thousand birds
      used to answer specific questions from which we all stand to
      benefit, with killing hundreds of thousands of birds in a mass
      slaughter.<br>
      <br>
      Kind regards<br>
      Michael Mills<br>

                    My query stems from first-hand reports from genuine
                    conservationists working in Tanzania who have been
                    appalled to see the many boxes of specimens killed
                    by you, Bowie, Kiure,<i> et al.</i> over the years.
                    How can we ever hope to tackle the devastating bird
                    slaughter in Malta and the Middle East while
                    enquiring minds like yours are clearing the East
                    African forests of its threatened avifauna? <br>
                    <br>
                    Unless you have no objection to the bird slaughter
                    in the Mediterranean, surely this is nothing short
                    of double standards on your part?<br>

                                                so maybe another
