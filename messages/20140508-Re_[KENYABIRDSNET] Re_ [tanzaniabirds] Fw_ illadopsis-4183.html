<p class="MsoNormal">Dear Mike,</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Many thanks for your considered mail which raises some very
interesting points, many of which I wholly agree with you on. Please bear in
mind that the email below includes my personal feelings on the matter of such
bird collection and is by no means meant to be an attack upon you or your own
stance. <br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Firstly, I agree that the collection of birds in the past
has advanced our knowledge and understanding immensely and there may, in
future, be a particular requirement for one or two specimens to be collected of
a particular species in the future. However, I think that even you may shocked
and even alarmed at the level of collecting from these forests. The only way
that we can truly know the scale of this is to ask the Professor to provide
information on the number of individuals of each species that he has collected
from Tanzania over the years. I am sure that he has nothing to hide or be
ashamed of so let us take a look at the figures that I am “over-reacting”
about. That said, if you think that you can look into a crate of 200+ Cabanis’s
Greenbul, taken from a small geographical area, and think “Yep, I’m OK with
that” then I really do think that is a great shame. The fact that this is a
locally common bird does not justify such excessive removal. I would be very
interested to know what considerable advances in our knowledge and
understanding of the species, and its place within its habitat, have been
garnered through collection that <u>could not</u> have been garnered through field
observation, photographic images and feather collection.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Secondly, I mostly agree with your comment about the removal
of the birds from the forest and their subsequent replacement by the same
species. However, this is based on current levels of understanding and it would
show typical human arrogance to claim this to be fact, sit back and allow such
collection efforts to take place. The only fact that we can be sure of is that
we do not know what the impacts of such bird removal will be. History has shown
us that when even very abundant and obviously fecund birds are killed at
levels, beyond an unknown threshold, that extinctions, both local and global,
can and do occur. Again, once we see the numbers from the Professor, we’ll be
able to better decide if the numbers are ‘acceptable’ and maybe even &#39;agreeable&#39;.<br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I’ll move on to a few areas where I disagree with your
comments. You write “Photos are not suitable for capturing all the nuances of
bird plumage, and it’s impossible to take photos in a controlled enough
situation to make proper comparisons later.” I am wondering if you could
outline what these nuances could include as I am sure that just about every
conceivable nuance can be captured through imagery. If it meant using
‘forensic’-type methods in the field, so be it but it can be achieved. This is
more about the time it takes to ‘process’ a bird in the field – see below.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">You write; “I think it takes courage and clear thinking to
knowingly kill” I’m sorry Mike but really? I cannot help but think that it
takes far more intelligence and a greater level of humanity to develop ways of
studying birds and other animals without the need for killing. Killing is easy
and almost effortless and that is why the practice continues. It takes far more
time, patience and skill to acquire detailed images from the field and to
remove the necessary feathers from a bird for sampling at a later date. I have
seen this performed in the field and know that it can be done and, more
important, IS BEING DONE by those who choose to adopt a more holistic approach
to bird science. My biggest argument here is that the practice is archaic and
not necessary for the advancement of bird science.<br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Further, you write that Fjeldsa <i>et al</i>. have “opened up our
understanding of the diversification of forest birds in this region and is the basis
for sound conservation.” Here, you make it sound as though we should be
grateful to the Professor and his team and that we somehow owe him a debt for
killing so many birds on our behalf. Again I ask, what could not have been
learnt from field observation and DNA sampling of feathers, not to mention
vocalisations?</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Finally, you write “I don&#39;t think you can equate killing a
few thousand birds used to answer specific questions from which we all stand to
benefit, with killing hundreds of thousands of birds in a mass slaughter.”
Personally, from my own morality point of view, I do equate them alike but I do
not expect everyone to feel the same way. The Japanese slaughtered whales in
the name of science after all; this statement is not missing the point but is open to interpretation. I genuinely accept that we all have a different
stance on matters of morality and I think that you, the Professor and I are all
located at different points of the scale. I do not profess that mine is right
or better, it is just different but certainly not unique.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I do consider myself open-minded Mike and the aim of my
original mail was merely to highlight the unpalatable side of the Professor’s work
and bring the details out in the open for all to see and make up their own
minds. But I’ll leave you with one final thought; would it not be nicer to
learn something new about a species in the field without the need for killing
it?</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">With humble regards,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Adam</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>

    <div>Dear Adam<br>
      <br>
      This is my first posting on KenyaBirdNet, but I would like to
      encourage you to be a more open about this. I dabble on the edge
      of science and do a lot of investigating into African birds,
      including looking a museum specimens, and unfortunately there is
      nothing nearly as good and useful for sorting out complex issues
      as specimens, especially when collected together with DNA from
      known individuals. Photos are not suitable for capturing all the
      nuances of bird plumage, and its impossible to take photos in a
      controlled enough situation to to make proper comparisons later. <br>
      <br>
      The vast majority of forest birds that are particularly confusing
      and interesting - illadopsis, greenbuls, sunbirds and such like -
      are in fact rather common and even taking a couple of hundred of
      each species spread across several sites in Tanzania is not going
      to really going to drive any species closer to extinction. Birds
      are continually replacing themselves through reproduction and
      where there are vacant territories in suitable habitat they will
      be replaced quite quickly. I think the vast majority of
      populations of montane forest birds are habitat-limited rather
      than limited by the removal of individual birds. Of course there
      is a handful of very rare species (Dapple-throat, perhaps some
      Alethes, Long-billed Forest Warbler, etc) where sampling for
      scientific purposes might actually affect populations, but these
      are very much the exception. In this case - certainly for
      Endangered and Critically Endangered species - I think there would
      need to be very special justification for collecting any
      individuals.<br>
      <br>
      Also, I think it is important to remember that the work the Jon
      Fjeldsa and colleagues has been doing has opened up our
      understanding of the diversification of forest birds in this
      region and is the basis for sound conservation. You might feel
      that enough sampling has been done, but Tanzania&#39;s mountains are
      so complex and varied that really there is a long way still to go
      before a complete picture exists. Without a complete picture we
      cannot know where our conservation priorities lie.<br>
      <br>
      In this day and age there is a little bit of over-reaction to any
      form of killing. When its done in a planned manner with specific
      questions in mind I think we generally stand to gain from the
      exercise. Personally I&#39;m useless at killing and of course I don&#39;t
      like the idea of it, but I think it takes courage and clear
      thinking to knowingly kill. I doubt Jon or his colleagues enjoy
      killing, but they know the advantages it has.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, I don&#39;t think you can equate killing a few thousand birds
      used to answer specific questions from which we all stand to
      benefit, with killing hundreds of thousands of birds in a mass
      slaughter.<br>
      <br>
      Kind regards<br>

                    My query stems from first-hand reports from genuine
                    conservationists working in Tanzania who have been
                    appalled to see the many boxes of specimens killed

                    How can we ever hope to tackle the devastating bird

                    Unless you have no objection to the bird slaughter
