Dear All,
Because I was getting way out of my depth in the Lovebird issue, I
wrote to a professional Evolutionary Biologist in the US, sending him
all of the files and correspondence relevant to this issue.


I have now received his very interesting response to the documentation
supplied….


From Jay McEntee 29th May 2014
Hi Brian,
I'm very sorry for the delay. …..
I can give you a general assessment of how I would view the
circumstances according to
the evidence you've gathered, but I'm sure I haven't yet absorbed all
of the details, so
hopefully I won't be too wrong about some of it.
