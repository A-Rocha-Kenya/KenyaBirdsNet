Dear All,
Can I just say that these figures could be the most important sets on
the entire African continent, that will show the component species
status changes that will prove that the Arab and Mediterranean bird
slaughters are having on these visitors to Africa, that have to cross
the killing fields twice a year.
There cannot be anywhere in Africa that has such a long history of
study in a specific site, coupled with the fact that it is in Africas
most important and voluminous sub-saharan passerine migration area. It
will be a must for many arguments about the necessity of species
conservation in many future papers,
Best to all
Brian

Dear Itai

We've just produced a report and summarised history of the ringing at
Ngulia
over 40 years as a Scopus Special Supplement and have the copies here in
UK.
This includes full details, with maps, of all recoveries, analyses of
biometric data, and a varied selection of photographs. This is available at
the special price of 12 Euros (includes postage) to Ngulia participants
from
Europe. But I don't know the best means of payment for folk in Israel where
I'm sure a few will be interested.

A few copies will be available by next month at 1000/- from NatureKenya and
more will reach there in August. Perhaps you could advertise this on
Kenyabirdsnet.

All the best
David
