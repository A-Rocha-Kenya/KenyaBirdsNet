Thanks for this Peter, I think I know exactly where you mean. There
are some nice unwatched hills in there, I think you can get through to
the Machakos-Wote road? It will be very interesting to see if you find
any more there.
Best for now

Dear Brian and James,

From Mombasa road you turn left immediately you get to Salama town then
drive about
15km. We started hiking from Mukaa High School heading eastwards,that is
where I spotted the AP Flycatcher.
You will be kept company by several Augur Buzzards hovering above you,not to
mention the scenic landscape which is just amazing!

Regards,

Peter Wairasho

Thanks for this James it will be very nice to see the images. But I
wonder where the birds down here are originating from, it's difficult
to conceive that they would wander down here from Ethiopia, but
stranger things have happened.
Best for now

Dear Peter and Brian,

The race ferreti, is common and widespread here in Ethiopia, especially,
in
the SW. I will check through my pics and attach some for your perusal and
records too.

Happy birding always,
JKN

Brian - BTW, I have been birding with two guests (Alister and Claire) out
here and they will coming to bird with soon in Kenya. Enjoy their company!

Dear Peter,
This is an exciting find, it is the race ferreti. I have only seen the
bird as you describe twice, and both were in Nairobi NP. They are
otherwise unreported, and this is the most beautiful of all the
Paradise Flycatcher forms. Stevenson and Fanshawe do not mention the
race at all, and have no illustration. Zimmermann &amp; Turner seen to
have something askew, as they do mention ferreti, and even say it is
widespread in our region however in the description they mention white
on the wing, but nothing of that long white tail that you saw. So I
think it is a bit mixed up in the literature and needs some revision.
Where exactly are the Kilome Hills?
Best for now
Brian

Hi Birders!

Over the weekend I was hiking in Kilome hills where I observed
one African Paradise Flycatcher with two morphs i.e rufous and white.
It looked like the common rufous morph with the glossy black head,blue
eye
wattle,
greyish part below and the mantle was rufous. However the wings and the
long
tail were
all in pure white morph. Unfortunately I did'n carry my camera with me
for
the photo though.
Could it be a resultant of interbreeding and is it confined to a
particular
region perhaps?

Peter Wairasho
