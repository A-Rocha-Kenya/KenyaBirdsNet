    On the coast in Watamu we have the all white bird quite commonly
    (ringed several at the A Rocha Kenya centre and also in
    Arabuko-Sokoke). I have never seen a white female - has anyone else?
    I have also found immature birds moulting from red to white and
    believe that only males are ever all white and that they start off
    life as red juveniles. I was also surprised to see a fully white
    male at St Andrew's Turi, near Molo, this last weekend. Paradise
    Flys are about the only birds that are regularly in the eucalyptus
    plantations - which is where this bird was. Stunning... as is the <i>ferreti</i>!

            <p>Dear Clive,<br>
              I would have thought that if they were a phase, then we
              would see so<br>
              much more of them, and they are a real rarity in Kenya,
              hence not<br>
              being illustrated in the regional guides.<br>
              As regards to the all white birds, these are northern dry
              birds, where<br>
              they are exclusive, whilst red birds are in moister
              habitats. Where<br>
              the white bird is not found, as in southern Kenya uplands,
              but also<br>
              Magadi Road for some reason, it is all red. However we do
              get the very<br>
              rare superb all white bird turning up in Nairobi NP from
              time to time.<br>
              But ferreti I have only ever seen twice in Kenya, both in
              NNP, whilst<br>
              in Ethiopia it is a dominant form in some areas. You would
              expect it<br>
              to be reported from our northern borderlands, but as far
              as I can make<br>
              out, they are all normal whites.<br>
              I am posting the Nakuru bird I stumbled across in the
              internet,<br>
              correctly labelled,<br>
              Best for now<br>

              &gt; It's quite possible that white birds are not morphs

              &gt;&gt; Dear Peter, James and all,<br>
              &gt;&gt; Just to show what a spectacular bird ferreti is,
              attached are images I<br>
              &gt;&gt; found on the net from Ethiopia. Whilst I was
              ferreting around for this<br>
              &gt;&gt; bird (pun intended) I found an image of a bird
              taken in Nakuru!!!<br>
              &gt;&gt; Now although the guides have sadly omitted the
              bird, now you know what<br>
              &gt;&gt; you are on the lookout for!<br>
              &gt;&gt; Best for now<br>
