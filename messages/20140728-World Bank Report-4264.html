'environmentally disastrous' | Environment | theguardian.com &nbsp;| </U><FONT 
color=#323232><U>Friday 25 July 2014 14.01 BST<BR></U></FONT></B><BR><U>Radical 
plans by the World Bank to relax the conditions on which it lends up to $50bn 
(£29bn) a year to developing countries have been condemned as potentially 
disastrous for the environment and likely to weaken protection of indigenous 
peoples and the poor.<BR>&nbsp;<BR><FONT color=#20007f>A leaked draft of the 
bank's proposed new "safeguard policies"</FONT>, seen by the Guardian, suggests 
that existing environmental and social protection will be gutted to allow 
logging and mining in even the most ecologically sensitive areas, and that 
indigenous peoples will not have to be consulted before major projects like palm 
oil plantations or large dams palm go ahead on land which they traditionally 
occupy.<BR><BR>Under the proposed new "light touch" rules, the result of a two 
year consultation within the bank, borrowers will be allowed to opt out of 
signing up to employment safeguards, existing protection for biodiversity will 
be shredded, countries will be al- lowed to assess themselves, and harmful 
projects are much more likely to occur, ac- cording to World Bank watchdog 
groups including the <FONT color=#20007f>Bank Information Centre (BIC)</FONT>, 
the Ulu Foundation and the <FONT color=#20007f>International Trade Union 
Confederation</FONT>.<BR><BR>Stephanie Fried, director of the Ulu Foundation, 
said the leaked draft undermines World Bank president Jim Yong Kim, who has 
stated several times that existing safeguards would not be diluted as a result 
of the review.<BR><BR>"Despite Kim's promise .... this plan reveals a shocking 
attempt to eviscerate protections for the poor while giving a green light for 
the destruction of forests and the natural environment," she 
said.<BR><BR>According to the groups, the bank is proposing to gut most of the 
usual requirements to assess impacts on people and the environment when a 
project is being developed, leaving it up to governments and staff to use their 
own discretion, in a clear attempt to avoid responsibility and 
accountability.<BR><BR>"The leaked proposal reveals a significant weakening of 
existing standards. They are not only at odds with the bank's stated goals of 
ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity, but lowers the bar for 
the international community," said Nezir Sinani, climate change coordinator at 
the BIC.<BR><BR>The draft uses stronger language on indigenous peoples' rights 
but Sinani said it was undermined by a proposed loophole for governments to opt 
out of applying the bank's policy on indigenous peoples, jeopardising the rights 
of hunter-gatherer com- munities such as the pygmies of the Congo 
rainforest.<BR><BR>"Most shockingly, the draft framework provides an opt-out 
option for governments who do not wish to provide essential land and natural 
resource rights protections to indigenous peoples within their states. If this 
were adopted, it would represent a wink and a nod by the World Bank to 
governments that they should not feel compelled to respect international human 
rights law," said BIC.<BR><BR>"[If these proposals are passed] workers in World 
Bank-funded projects will be devoid of even the most basic protections. The bank 
risks creating a chaotic mishmash of varying labour standards requirements, with 
the World Bank's far weaker than others," said Peter Bakvis, director of ITUC in 
Washington.<BR><BR>A spokesman for the World Bank said the new policies would 
support sustainable development. "The World Bank’s safeguard policies are at the 
center of our efforts to protect people and the environment and to achieve our 
goals to end extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity in a sustainable 
manner in our partner countries.<BR><BR>"We are currently in the process of 
reviewing and updating our safeguard policies to deliver efficiently on the twin 
goals and to support more sustainable use of resources, promote social 
inclusion, discourage discrimination, help address new development challenges 
and be mindful of the economic burdens development can place on future 
generations," he said.<BR><BR>The World Bank group, which includes the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the 
International finance corporation (IFC) is the world's largest development 
institution, with Britain its largest donor.<BR><BR>Strong safeguards and 
conditions on its loans and guarantees were put in place after a series of 
environmentally destructive projects in the 1980s and 1990s such as the Narmada 
dam in India and the resettlement of hundreds of thousands of people to make way 
for palm plantations in Indonesia.<BR><BR>The leaked copy of the new policies 
will be discussed by the bank's board next week. It is understood that a vote 
will be taken on whether to send the draft for public comment.<BR><BR>Earlier 
this month, leaked comments on the draft by 12 of the bank's most senior 
employees, <FONT color=#20007f>revealed disquiet that the proposed new 
safeguards would lead to an increase in "problem projects"</FONT>.<BR><BR>Ana 
Revenga, the bank's vice-president for poverty reduction, warned in those 
comments: "It might appear [from the draft policies] that the bank is interested 
in lending more, hence lowering standards ... [It] would likely entail an 
increase in the number of problem projects and cancellations."<BR><BR></U><FONT
