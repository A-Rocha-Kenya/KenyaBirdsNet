Greetings Birders

Sheena Orr, Bettina Ng'weno, Makanda Kioko and I spent an amazing five days
in Nariokotome, Todonyang' and Lobur in North Turkana on August 11-15. Our
kind hosts were the Missionary Community of Saint Paul the Apostle.

Brian Finch had alerted us that Todonyang' was the place where the Egyptian
Plover had been seen ....in 1971(!) according to Zimmerman, Turner and
Pearson. Despite the low probabilities, finding the Egyptian Plover became
one of our goals and the source of many jokes. Against all odds, find it we
did!...but on the banks of the Omo River just over the border in Ethiopia,
not in Kenya.

The bird I most hoped to see was the Black Crowned Crane. We saw storks,
herons, egrets, pelicans, ibises and spoonbills among the Typha reeds that
fringe the lake at the northern end, but no cranes. Then on the last day we
reached the area between the Kenya border and the mission at Todonyang' just
after sunset. As we drove back, flock after flock of Black Crowned Cranes
flew up from the reeds to roost in the acacia trees along the road. There
must have been at least 40 of the beautiful birds.

Other highlights included Egyptian Vulture and Fox Kestrel at Lobur, Pygmy
Sunbird near the shore about 30 km south of Todonyang, and flocks of
Chestnut-backed Sparrow Larks (as well as flocks of Chestnut-headed Sparrow
Larks) in several areas. Crested Larks, of course, were everywhere. We are
compiling more detailed lists that we will send to Kenya Bird Map.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
