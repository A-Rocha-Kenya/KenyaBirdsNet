<FONT FACE="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><SPAN STYLE='font-size:12pt'>Hi Ben<BR>
<BR>
Yes, male Black Cuckooshrikes in Nairobi are usually all black, although we&#8217;ve just seen one with yellow shoulders at Uhuru Gardens and the Nairobi Safari Walk. The orange gape is often not visible.<BR>
<BR>
The cuckoo in your garden is likely to be a young Red-chested Cuckoo.<BR>
<BR>
Hope you will get a reply re the nightjar!<BR>
<BR>
Best wishes, Fleur<BR>

I would be grateful if somebody could confirm the identity of the two birds and comment on my Black Cuckoo-shrike observation.<BR>
<BR>
My first query is a nightjar seen in the Mara, roosting on a hippo path beside a river with quite thick vegetation and trees at the beginning of August this year. &nbsp;When the bird flew it revealed white sides to the tail and also strong white markings on the wings although it all happened so quickly that I could not be certain of what was where. &nbsp;I think it was a square-tailed nightjar but my photo does not seem to fit with the images in the bird guides that I have looked in.<BR>
<BR>
My second query is a Cuckoo - I suspect that it is a female Common Cuckoo but again my observations and images do not seem to fit with the bird guides, and also I don't think it ought to be in Nairobi yet ! &nbsp;I have seen it for the first time on Saturday 30 th August in Rosslyn, Nairobi feasting on fat hairy caterpillars.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, also in my Rosslyn garden, I am seeing what I am sure is a black Cuckoo-shrike but it has no other colours or markings at all. &nbsp;No yellow gape or shoulder but it is associating with another bird that looks like a female BCS. &nbsp;Is this unusual - I see there was a thread earlier about BCS but I was uncertain if they were referring to just the lack of a yellow shoulder or also no yellow gape.<BR>
<BR>
If this is the wrong group to be referring this type of question please feel free to redirect me to the correct place.<BR>
<BR>
regards<BR>
<BR>
Ben<BR>
