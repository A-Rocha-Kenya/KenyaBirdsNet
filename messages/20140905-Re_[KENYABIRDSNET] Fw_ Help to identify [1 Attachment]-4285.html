Dear George,
Your bird certainly looks like a Steppe, but this is really early. I
tried to enlarge your image, to see if it isn't a Tawny with strange
pale gape feathering, as it seems to go back even further than a
Steppe, but it was not clear enough,
Best for now
Brian

Hello.Hope that everything is well.
Kindly request if anybody can help to identify this
partcular species of eagle nesting near the spekes weaver
birds colony. Found at Nakuru National park last Month.
Again the relationship among the bird of prey and
weavers.
Its among the large big brown eagle but was
afraid to say Steppe eagle coz of the big gape that extends
to the back of the eye but i do know that they are paleartic
migrant.
Your help will be highly appreciated.
Warm regards to all and best birding
times.
George.
