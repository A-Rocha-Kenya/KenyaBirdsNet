Dear All,
Apart from regular Eurasian Bee-eater passage and the odd Willow
Warbler, no other migrant land birds are being reported in Kenya. Itâ€™s
October, and no Wheatears?

This is what was at Lake Bogoria on 24th September 2012. If this were
a normal arrival time, migrant numbers over the last seven days should
have been increasing exponentially but where are they?

24TH SEPTEMBER 2012 LAKE BOGORIA.. Whinchat, 2 Isabelline Wheatear,
also 300+ Yellow Wagtails, 15+ Northern Wheatears, 4 Willow Warblers,
numerous Sand Martins and Barn Swallows and a Eurasian Hoopoe.

We are now in the six week period when Lesser Striped Swallows
mysteriously disappear from Nairobi, so any records for the next six
weeks in the Nairobi area should be reported, and also if they are
regularly in your area for most of the year, their absence should also
be confirmed.

Best for now
Brian
