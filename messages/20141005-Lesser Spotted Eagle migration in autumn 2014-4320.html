<B><U>www.Satellite-Telemetry.de</B></U> is the website of the World Working Group on Birds of Prey (WWGBP, <B>www.raptors-international.org</B>) where some of the results of satellite telemetry studies are presented. Results published so far can be found on the homepage www.Raptor-Research.de, where many papers can be downloaded as PDF documents. For reasons of time, only the course of migration of the Lesser Spotted Eagle, in cooperation with the BirdLife Germany federal office, is dealt with here, with a very rough presentation of the course of migration. In order to show this online in as near as possible to real time, only one fix per day will be used, although many more than 100 fixes are received daily from some birds. <BR>
<BR>
As for a breakdown of the Lesser Spotted Eagles that we track during autumn migration in 2014 please visit <B><U>www.Satellite-Telemetry.de</B></U> (English and German texts). There is also a short report on the past course of migration.  The birds are individually designated by their transmitter number and in most cases they have also been given a name. <BR>
<BR>
Migration within Germany is not shown, in order to guarantee the anonymity of the eyrie sites of this extremely rare species. <BR>
