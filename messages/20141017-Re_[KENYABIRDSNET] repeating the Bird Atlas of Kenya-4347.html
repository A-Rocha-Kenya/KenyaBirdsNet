        have already heard of the Kenya Bird Map project that is
        repeating and updating the Bird Atlas of Kenya (Lewis &amp;
        Pomeroy 1989) - as mentioned in my email cc&#39;d to the group re
        the recent Bat Hawk record in Nairobi regarding submitting it.
        This email is to give a more general introduction to the project
        and an invitation for you to get involved.<u></u><u></u></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;color:black">If you do <i>any</i>
        birding in Kenya, even if it is simply your garden or when on
        holiday, then please do join us in this very stimulating project
        that has critical value for bird conservation in Kenya. Check it
        out: <a href="http://kenyabirdmap.adu.org.za/" target="_blank">http://kenyabirdmap.adu.org.za/</a><u></u><u></u></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;color:black">. <br>
      </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;color:black"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;color:black">The most basic
          information about a bird species that is needed for its
          conservation is its distribution. </span>35 years have passed
        since the fieldwork for the first / only Bird Atlas of Kenya
        published in 1989. There have been huge changes in habitat
        across the country as well<span> a </span>as

        a host of other pressures on bird populations but no-one really
        knows to what extent this has affected distributions and
        abundance of our species. We have an idea about some of the more
        noticeable species - Egyptian Vultures have all but disappeared,
        House Sparrows have spread from Mombasa to almost every urban
        centre across the country - but we have very very little actual
        data to show even these, and changes in less obvious species
        will have gone unnoticed. <u></u><u></u></span> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;color:black">This project will
        allow us to document and describe these changes using an
        internet-based system that means records are mapped live as they
        are submitted. The project works as a classic &#39;atlas&#39; in that
        the country is divided into a grid of squares and the aim is to
        visit every square - ideally many times - and produce a species
        list for it. This provides an online, constantly updating
        distribution map of every species in Kenya. Even better, a
        simple but robust and stimulating protocol of listing the birds
        in the order you see them and recording how many you see in each
        hour of birding means the data can be used for an index of
        abundance to track population change - are the numbers
        increasing or decreasing? Records of individual birds or short
        lists are also useful for simple distribution maps. <br>
      </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">In the first atlas, the atlas squares were half
      a degree square. Now we are working on a 5 minute by 5 minute
      square which are called &#39;pentads&#39;. The atlas is linked with Google
      Maps meaning you can locate pentads and work out their boundaries,
      note land marks and look for new islands of habitat within a
      pentad that might hold different species by zooming in on the
      satellite image. A graph of reporting rate against date shows
      trends in seasonality for species and in due course it will be
      possible to overlay a current distribution of a species with that
      of the first bird atlas to show any changes that might have
      happened.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The key to success in this project is getting
      as many people as possible involved and contributing. Please join
      us!<br>
      <span style="font-size:12.0pt;color:black"><u></u><u></u></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;color:black">The National Museums
        of Kenya, A Rocha Kenya, Tropical Biology Association and Nature
        Kenya have come together under the Bird Committee of the EANHS
        in association with the Animal Demography Unit of the University
        of Cape Town to launch the initiative and make it happen. The
        aim is to have the data freely available and as useful as
        possible to anyone who might want to use it. An office has been
        opened linked to the Ornithology Section, NMK and you can get
        more information from them by writing to
        <a href="mailto:kenyabirdmap@naturekenya.org" target="_blank">&lt;kenyabirdmap@naturekenya.org&gt;</a>. <u></u><u></u></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;color:black">&quot;Why another online
        bird record database?&quot; you may ask - surely we should just use
        eBird or one of the other similar projects. In many ways yes,
        and in fact we hope to be able to link data from such projects
        to the Kenya Bird Map, but the major drawback of a
        non-grid-system based protocol is that you will find birders
        submit data from the &#39;hot spots&#39; - those sites which are popular
        birding sites, which are known for certain species etc and as a
        result you get little or probably no data from the &#39;cold spots&#39;
        that actually might have important unknown populations of
        species and also which are integral to contributing to our
        overall understanding and knowledge of national bird
        populations, their status and trends. Furthermore, the simple
        but very robust protocol on data collection </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;color:black"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;color:black">(effectively a timed
          species count rather </span></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;color:black"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;color:black"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;color:black">than simply a
            species list from a certain geolocation on a given date</span>)
          of the </span>Kenya Bird Map adds significant value to the
        data when it comes to analysis and using it. However we
        certainly plan to link with such projects and see how data can
        be shared for the benefit of conserving our birds. In time it
        will be possible to select a map that shows the change between a
        species distribution at the time of the first atlas compared to
        its current distribution. Migration patterns will be possible to
        &quot;see&quot; happening and a species distribution will be identifiable
        as &#39;core&#39; areas and marginal areas for the species depending on
        reporting rate for a species. <br>
      </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Once again I&#39;ll reiterate our need for people
      to get involved in this citizen science project - if you can&#39;t
      yourself but know anyone who would be interested, please point
      them to the website. Registration is easy and free and also allows
      you to contribute to another excellent project, the Virtual Museum
      for Africa - mapping a wide number of taxa using digital images
      linked to a location and date. <br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">We shall post updates on kenyabirdsnet as the
      project continues. To date we have had over 15,000 records
      submitted and 135 pentads covered in pretty much just eight
      months. We do need help with some issues such as vetting - so if
      you are interested and able to assist, please let me know. But
      overall, please do get involved and submit records of birds and
      get others to join in. A smart phone app will hopefully be
      available before long to simplify the process as well.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">I believe this is going to be an extremely
      important tool for our use in bird conservation in Kenya in the
      years to come - I look forward to having many more join us with
      it!<br>
