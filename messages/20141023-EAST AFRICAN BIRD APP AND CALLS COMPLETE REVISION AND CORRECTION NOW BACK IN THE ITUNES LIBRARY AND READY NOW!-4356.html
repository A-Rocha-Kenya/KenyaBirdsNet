Deal All,
I have just this very moment heard from John Fanshawe, who said that
Apple have got our completely revised East African App available on
the ITunes library now.

All those who have the App from the original version, will be notified
that the update is ready for a free download.

I have also attached a image I just took this evening of Eurasian
Bee-eaters in our back paddock, sunning themselves in very low sun
(the first for four days I think), it shows colours you don't usually
see on bee-eaters electric being one of them!

best to all
Brian
