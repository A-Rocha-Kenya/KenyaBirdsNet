<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Dear All</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>I was at Sagala last Thursday (11th) and Lois (the 
family member who is now in charge) told me she has about 6 bandas ready for 
use.&nbsp; The pool was definitely empty and although the viewing platform is OK 
the water hole is overgrown and empty.&nbsp; Unless magic has happened in a 
week. . . .&nbsp; . </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>There is noone more eager than me to get back to 
Sagala and Lois said she would inform me when things were indeed fully up and 
running.&nbsp; Food has to ordered and there is no bar at present.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Birds are still beautiful and many of them, far 
more than now exist around Taita Hills Lodge!&nbsp; As I got out of my car the 
first bird I heard was a Red-chested Cuckoo (always there Dec/Jan) a Klaas 
Cuckoo and a Diedrik.&nbsp; The garden (where I had a picnic lunch) was full of 
Paradise Flycatchers, lots white phase males and one or two brown phase.&nbsp; 
Vitelline masked Weavers were nesting on several trees, Black-throated Barbets 
called and Golden-breasted Starlings flew into the tree tops plus a multitude of 
others.&nbsp; I didn't have much energy to walk round the garden after driving 
for 3 hours on the Msa-Nbi road which is probably in a worse state than I have 
ever seen it, especially on the up side.&nbsp; Hopefully 'they' (whoever they 
are these days) will get around to repairing it so I can get up to Sagala again 
with less stress.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Happy Xmas birdng to all of you.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>P.S. At Maktau station I saw all three mousebirds 
Speckled, Blue-naped and White-headed!&nbsp; Also a beautiful Irania, a bird 
which I last saw about 10 years ago guess where?&nbsp; Sagala.</FONT></DIV>

  <DIV>Hi Everybody,</DIV>
  <DIV><BR></DIV>
  <DIV>not sure whether this is already "common" knowledge amongst bird 
  watchers: </DIV>
  <DIV><BR></DIV>
  <DIV>Sagala Lodge (<A

  &nbsp;is open for business again. Bungalows renovated incl. the viewing 
  platform in the lodge compound &amp; swimmingpool is ready for use too. </DIV>
