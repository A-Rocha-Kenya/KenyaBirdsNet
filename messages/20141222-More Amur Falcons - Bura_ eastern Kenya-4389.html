<div dir="ltr"><p class="MsoNormal">Hello everyone,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">On the 17<sup>th</sup> Dec 2014, on a fairly overcast late
morning while working in Bura Irrigation plantation (an area known as village
8), a hovering form caught my attention. That it was overcast, there was no
precise telling of the colour of the form. My immediate thought was a kestrel
then viewing through my binoculars, I noticed the pale face &amp; nearly
deceptive ‘black helmet ‘and in just a glimpse, given a quick twisting of the
head by the falcon, I thought I picked a white cheek and throat. But the bird’s
size (&amp; I believe the hovering) was just wrong for a Peregrine as I shifted
the identity in my mind. Then opportunity presented itself again as she turned
in my direction &amp; aaah! No extensive black moustache and the crissum region
was definitely darker (certainly chestnut from the photo).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Meanwhile, a second, then a third up to the 19<sup>th</sup>
showed up from roughly north easterly direction hovering and plunging into the
fallow farmland to pick on insects/rodents. Meanwhile, 2 probably already
satiated (or just breaking) birds perched on nearby power lines. Following
these observations, I had the opportunity for this photo shoot- cloudy
conditions notwithstanding. Amur Falcons they were!</p>
