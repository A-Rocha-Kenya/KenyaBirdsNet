    Hi Brian,<br>
    <br>
    Hope you  had a good Christmas! Am working on the ABC records again
    so am going through all the Kenyabirdsnet submissions from the past
    6 months carefully and thought I'd comment on your Pygmy Kingfisher
    record in NNP in July - from our ringing and retrapping them in
    Watamu, the young birds can change their bill colour to almost fully
    red well before they lose the brighter azure blue of the juv plumage
    on the back which when moulting would certainly give the mottled
    look that you saw. Having said that, bill colour isn't much to go by
    because we have also retrapped adult birds over a year later with
    bills that still have quite a lot of black in them - it's clearly
    quite variable.<br>
    <br>
    If you (or anyone else reading this) have any other records from the
    past 6 months that are not posted in kenyabirdsnet already, do let
    me have them in the next couple of days - thanks!<br>
    <br>
    Best,<br>
    <br>
    Colin<br>

              NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 30th July 2014<br>
              <br>
              Dear All,<br>
              Because of some disruption caused by the public holiday on
              Tuesday, it<br>
              was decided that we would visit the Park on Wednesday this
              week.<br>
              <br>
              The morning started dull and cold, and stayed that way
              until 4.30pm<br>
              when the sun came out and for a short while and it became
              warmer.<br>
              There was evidence of rain in the south-east, where dam
              levels had<br>
              once again risen, but otherwise it was dry.<br>
              <br>
              There was evidence of incursions from several species
              today,<br>
              presumably as a result of surrounding drought. There were
              many<br>
              Blue-naped Mousebirds, particularly in the north, three
              Lilac-breasted<br>
              Rollers were the first seen in the Park for a couple of
              years, and the<br>
              first multiple records for ten. Common Quailfinch were all
              through the<br>
              grasslands in small parties, more so in the south, and
              African<br>
              Silverbills were encountered in four different localities,
              in groups<br>
              of five to seven.<br>
              <br>
              Karen Plumbe kindly escorted the group around the Park,
              there was<br>
              Heather Elkin, Jennifer Oduori and myself, and we met up
              at Langata<br>
              Gate at 6.40am having had no traffic on Magadi Road. As
              Simon was at<br>
              the gate, it was very cheerful and efficient service and
              we were soon<br>
              on our way.<br>
              <br>
              Just in case the Caracals were about (but they weren’t),
              we took the<br>
              glade track soon after entering and followed a circuit all
              the way<br>
              round to Kisembe bridge back on the main road. A Little
              Grebe on the<br>
              Hippo-Grebe pond was the only thing of note, it was all
              extremely<br>
              quiet. When we checked the Langata Gate dam, again not a
              bird but<br>
              excitement was soon shown, as in the top of a dead branch
              on the other<br>
              side was the first Olive Pigeon for some fifteen years.
              Driving on, in<br>
              a few kilometres we found another pair of posing Olive
              Pigeons, and<br>
              five cavorting Green Pigeons that were displaying and
              mating. On<br>
              Forest Edge Dam was a Madagascar Pond Heron.<br>
              <br>
              Nagalomon Dam showed some activity, which included five
              Darters and a<br>
              pair of Swamphens. There were two Spotted Thick-knees on
              the Drift.<br>
              Whilst there was not much at Ivory Burning Site, an adult
              Gymnogene<br>
              was hunting over the area, a surprise there were a pair of<br>
              Hildebrandt’s Starlings, the first time in this part of
              the Park.<br>
              Taking the back road to the new swamp did not prove too
              birdy, but the<br>
              swamp itself held a couple of African Spoonbills, adult
              and large<br>
              immature African Water Rails, male, female and immature
              female<br>
              Painted-snipe, a Long-toed Plover, adults of two Ruff, one
              male had<br>
              not lost much of it’s breeding plumage (see image), six
              Wood and two<br>
              Green Sandpipers. In the sedges there were a number of
              Red-collared<br>
              Widowbirds that had grown long tails yet again. Also a
              pair of Greater<br>
              Blue-eared Starlings were present.<br>
              <br>
              There was a working party of slashers, cutting grass and
              vegetation<br>
              all the way from the new flats down to the new swamp. It
              was being cut<br>
              like a bush airstrip, this is on the inside of the
              Greenline fence,<br>
              and the question has to be asked why, and it continues
              parallel with<br>
              the road on the other side of the swamp as well. Is this
              for a<br>
              railway-line? It is so sad that everything that KWS does
              now, we view<br>
              with suspicion and much distrust.<br>
              <br>
              Retracing around to Hyena Dam, there was a sub-adult
              Bateleur and a<br>
              group of a dozen Wattled Starlings. Just below the
              causeway were a<br>
              pair of Spotted Thick-knees, not recorded from here
              before. Hyena Dam<br>
              entertained us with a Little Grebe, another Darter, and an
              immature<br>
              Purple Heron whilst we sat there, but the bird that wins
              the most<br>
              entertaining of the day was an adult female Little Bittern
              hunting in<br>
              the typha, we watched it for well over fifteen minutes as
              it clambered<br>
              around with flicking tail and flashing wings, but all we
              saw it catch<br>
              was a small tilapia. At one point it was next to an
              African Jacana,<br>
              which was quite a bit larger than it (see images).
              Following the<br>
              feeder creek back to the new swamp, there were Water Rails
              calling<br>
              from four places, another African Jacana, the pair of
              Long-toed<br>
              Plovers were back together, there were very many
              Three-banded Plovers<br>
              along this stretch.<br>
              <br>
              Another piece of entertainment was provided by the
              Yellow-billed<br>
              Kites. One had what looked like a yellow plastic streamer
              about five<br>
              feet long. It was flying around with this, when another
              kite appeared<br>
              and the passed the streamer, not in the middle as might be
              expected,<br>
              but at the very tip the original bird was holding it by.
              This happened<br>
              four times, and they were obviously having fun with this,
              before<br>
              landing with it in a tree.<br>
              <br>
              We could not find anything on the run-off, other than a
              pair of the<br>
              only Banded Martins seen today, and continued to Mbuni
              Picnic Site. On<br>
              the way we passed the Martial Eagle sitting tightly on the
              nest,<br>
              whilst at Mbuni, the Tawny Eagle now revealed a half grown
              chick,<br>
              still all white but the wings were dark brown. The second
              adult came<br>
              in whilst we were there. A Namaqua Dove flew through, but
              neither<br>
              Karen Primary School nor Eland Hollow Dams had any birds.<br>
              <br>
              Setting off across the grasslands for the south-east
              corner there was<br>
              a group of some fifteen Mottled Swift, and a few normal
              Red-rumped<br>
              Swallow with them, but also there was one of these birds
              resembling<br>
              West African Swallow with all white rump and broad white
              collar. Sadly<br>
              it disappeared before we could see it well. A little
              further there was<br>
              a sub-adult Black-chested Snake-Eagle.<br>
              <br>
              The murrum pits had the incongruous sight of a Hippo that
              just did not<br>
              have much depth in which to hide. Just seven vultures in
              the area, all<br>
              White-backed apart from single Ruppell’s and Lappet-faced.
              The Athi<br>
              Basin was quiet apart from the concentrations of game, our
              one and<br>
              only Secretarybird for the day was here. Athi Dam had so
              much water,<br>
              that the reduced area for feeding means less attraction to
              the birds,<br>
              there was a single Yellow-billed Stork, two African
              Spoonbills, four<br>
              Spur-winged and just two Kittlitz’s Plovers, and adult
              Little Stint,<br>
              Ruff and two Common Sandpipers. There was a Black-crowned
              Night-Heron<br>
              roosting on the Causeway.<br>
              <br>
              &gt;From here we headed to the Hippo Pools road. There
              were a group of<br>
              Zebra near the road, and as they cantered Jennifer saw
              that they had<br>
              flushed a nightjar, expecting it to be Dusky we were
              delighted to find<br>
              it was an adult male Slender-tailed (images attached), and
              it just sat<br>
              in the ditch and after admiring it for a while we left it
              still there.<br>
              Historically in the days when there was not the mad rush
              to get out of<br>
              the Park before 6.00pm, I had seen them flying over the
              grassland at<br>
              dusk along the Mbagathi River, but not for at least ten
              years, so this<br>
              was a great find. As we drove along the road, with hordes
              of Marabous<br>
              coming in to roost, we found Gabar Goshawk, Long-crested
              Eagle, a<br>
              Green Sandpiper on a pool, and the first Chestnut Sparrow
              for a while.<br>
              It was a male in fairly good plumage. Maybe the most
              interesting was a<br>
              Pygmy Kingfisher. It showed the makings of an immature of
              our race<br>
              picta (all white cheek patch), with rather washed out face
              and breast<br>
              colouring, back blotchy blue rather than uniform, black
              whisker mark,<br>
              but it had an entirely red bill of an adult (see images).<br>
              <br>
              It was now a rather hurried traverse to get back to the
              north, passing<br>
              Leopard Cliffs we had a pair of Pangani Longclaws, and at
              Kingfisher<br>
              was an adult Bateleur. Langata Gate dam was delightful
              with birds<br>
              coming in to drink, and a Great Egret for the day, it was
              hard to pull<br>
              ourselves away from the activity for the pre 6.00pm
              departure before<br>
              our Smart Cards were blocked, we made it though.<br>
              <br>
              There were four scattered pairs of Crowned Cranes, though
              no sign of<br>
              any nesting, and about eight Black-shouldered Kites were
              encountered.<br>
              <br>
              Some nice mammals, driving on the edge of the Kisembe
              forest in the<br>
              morning we encountered 11 Suni, of which seven encounters
              were single<br>
              animals, there was also a Bushbuck here with new twins. A
              nice male<br>
              Bohor Reedbuck at Hyena Dam, plenty of Hippos in
              Nagalomon, Hyena and<br>
              Athi Dams, and the strange one in the murrum pits above
              Athi Basin,<br>
              Black Rhino at Mbuni, and a pair of Whites above Athi
              basin where<br>
              there were three Lions, an Egyptian Mongoose on the forest
              edge and<br>
              finally a Serval near the Maasai Gate turn-off.<br>
              <br>
              A fantastic day even if the sun did delay its appearance
              until it was<br>
              time to leave!<br>
              <br>
              Best for now<br>
