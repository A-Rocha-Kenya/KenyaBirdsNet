<div dir="ltr">Hi Fleur, thanks for these comments. On the subject of Scarce Swifts, I had the following conversation with James Bradley, who lived in the Loresho area for many years and maintains a list for the location, in September 2012. Of course swifts can be very difficult, and I could be totally wrong about the identification, but it was an intriguing sighting. I take the point Fleur that the white rump of the White-rumped Swift can be difficult to see, especially in overcast conditions, but I scanned the flock for quite a long time and could not find a white rump at all. With best regards, JD<div><br></div><div>














<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Dear James, </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">An interesting sighting over my home in
Loresho this morning – a flock of about 15-20 small, darkish swifts with a very
pointed tail, deeply forked when opened, and with slightly paler throats. The
flock was silent, and was over my house for close to half an hour (though the
overcast sky made it frustratingly difficult to get a very clear view). </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I would say with some confidence that they
were Scarce Swifts, with which I was familiar during the time I lived in
Tigoni. They had no white on the rump, and were too dark and slim to be Palm
Swifts. The smallish size and deeply forked tail rules out most other things.
The only query I would have is the size of the flock, which is unusual for
Scarce Swifts, which are usually more solitary, though I can’t think what else
they might be. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace:none"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT">Good to hear from you and thanks for
passing on this sighting. From your description they sound like Scarce Swift
and a very nice record for Nairobi. Interestingly, I was corresponding with Don
Turner about this species a while ago and he had the following to say …</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace:none"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace:none"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT;color:rgb(251,0,0)">&quot;Scarce Swift is
even more of an enigma.  In southern Africa (Malawi &amp; Zimbabwe) it is
very much an intra-African migrant Oct - April and some of these almost
certainly reach southern Tanzania, but how far north they come is
unknown.  Kenya and n. Tanzania birds may be largely resident, but records
are low for the May-September period, while records from South Sudan and
Ethiopia are only May-Sept.  Does this suggest that our birds move north
during the cold season, or do they go south ??</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace:none"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace:none"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT">Your observation would appear to fit
well with birds on passage from Ethiopia (perhaps even Kenya) southwards and
the fact that you had a good number together also suggests migrants. I&#39;ll
forward your sighting on to him as I know he will be interested.</span></p>

<br>
Great to see the Karen Bird Walk going strong!<br>
<br>
Good point below about overlooked birds, such as Brown-backed Woodpecker which is common in leafy gardens and other forested habitats in Nairobi.<br>
<br>
But Scarce Swift? I don’t think we get Scarce Swift in Nairobi. It might be confused with White-rumped Swift, whose white rump is often difficult to see.<br>
<br>
Wishing you all good birding, Fleur<br>

Hi Patrick &amp; Mike, <br>
<br>
Thanks for those comments. Patrick, I agree that the Brown-backed Woodpecker is fairly common throughout the forested areas of Karen, and elsewhere in Nairobi.<br>
<br>
To expand on my comments about it being more common around Nairobi than is supposed, I think it is one of a group of species that can be underreported because it has some resemblance to a similar species that is more common - in this case, the Cardinal Woodpecker - and it takes a certain level of awareness by even experienced birders to sort them out. <br>
<br>
Others in this category could include Thick-billed Seedeater (Streaky Seedeater), Red-faced Cisticola (Singing Cisticola), Scarce Swift (Palm Swift), Collared Sunbird (Variable Sunbird), and Slender-billed Greenbul (various canopy warblers). <br>
<br>
An interesting point for discussion!!<br>
<br>
All best, JD<br>

Karen club is always a great place for bird walks and it sounds like you saw many of the usuals.<br>
<br>
To add further to the brown backed woodpecker sightings, we live on Westwood park road not far from the dukas and we always have them in the fig trees in our garden. A very common species for us so I would suspect they are fairly common throughout forested areas of Karen?<br>

Interesting about the Brown-backed Woodpecker .  It is quite often seen on the Wednesday bird walk i Ngong forest , so no reason why it should not be on the course !<br>
