Wow John,
This is very impressive, it should be a bird reserve that tolerates golfers!
Best for now

*Karen Country Club bird walk, 23 January 2015*



On a glorious, sunny, mild morning, myself, Alastair Campbell, Karen
Plumbe, Sarah Chiles and Barb Schlegel set off to explore the avian
delights of Karen Country Club. The first sighting was a Silvery-cheeked
Hornbill, and other “big birds” were to follow.



The wetlands were alive with birds, and it was hard to know where to look
next. We had clear views of Tropical Boubou, Rueppell’s Robin Chat, Willow
Warbler and African Citril, and a good sighting of a Grey-headed Kingfisher
was soon followed by a Giant Kingfisher flying across the reedbeds. Two
Grey Crowned Cranes flew past emitting their distinctive call. The
highlight, though, was an immature Purple Heron, the first sighting of that
species for Karen Club.



At the dams, the usual Reed Cormorant, Common Sandpiper and Three-banded
Plovers were joined by three Black-winged Stilts, which treated us to a
flying display, and a single Green Sandpiper, the first of the season at
that site. And intriguingly, there were two Yellow-billed Ducks sitting
next to each other in perfect light, at the same angle to the sun, one with
an obvious green speculum and the other with an obvious blue speculum. I am
convinced there are real differences out there, and not just tricks of the
light.



On our walk, a number of the “usuals” were strangely absent – no
Yellow-whiskered Greenbul, or Hamerkop, or Great Cormorant, or barbets, or
Streaky Seedeater. But we did get excellent views of a flock of 20+ Rock
Martins mixed with some Plain Martins, as well as Hartlaub’s Turaco, Cape
Robin Chat and Pale Flycatcher.



The total of 48 species was very satisfying, and we thoroughly deserved our
bacon and egg baps washed down with coffee.
