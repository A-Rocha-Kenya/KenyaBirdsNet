NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 19th February 2015

Dear All,
On 19th February Rupert Watson and myself had a day in Nairobi
National Park. We arrived at Langata Gate, and found not only the
customer services person at the gate, but he made us feel so welcome
and was very professional in expediting our entry. There had been the
recent rain, but it was all fast disappearing with little trace left.

Our first stop was at the marshy vlei near the Galleria junction, it
held some forty Wood Sandpipers, and four Green. Apart from this six
Yellow Wagtails with Black Stork and Great Sparrowhawk flying over.
There was nothing at all on Hippogrebe Dam and we continued along the
Kisembe River where there were two confiding Black Storks, one being a
browner bird.</pre></div></body>
