Hi Darcy,
Scaly Francolins are resident in rank lantana growth on the KARI
compound, on the left just down from Blue Posts,
best for now

Hi all,
Late this afternoon I glanced out the window to see a Scaly Francolin waddle
by followed almost immediately by a pair of Egyptian mongoose.  They quickly
went out of sight.  About a minute later the francolin passed by in the
opposite direction minus the mongoose.  I was rather surprised to find this
species in the garden of my (new) house.  For those of you who knew my old
house, we've moved closer to town and now live in Del Monte's Imani
compound, which is a much larger compound and has a tiny piece of indigenous
forest along a tributary to the Chania river.  I guess this is why this
species is still around here, as otherwise we are so close to Thika town and
surrounded by pineapples.
Cheers, Darcy
