<p><span>Hi everyone</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>Just out of interest - I saw my first summer migrants to the UK yesterday (bearing in mind I am living in London so less likely to see most migrants here). Two chiff chaffs battling it out with their voices in a tiny patch of woodland near Twickenham stadium. Their call is a good sign that spring is well on its way! I was surprised to see them in such an isolated pocket of habitat.</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>Looking forward to a week of birding in Kenya over the Easter period.</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>Kieran</span></p></body>
