Greetings birders

Migrants are moving through Nairobi. At Uhuru Gardens National Monument
today 22 April, Nature Kenya's Wednesday Morning Birdwalk observed Lesser
Grey Shrike, Red-backed Shrike, Isabelline Shrike, Willow Warbler and Common
Whitethroat.

The grasslands of Uhuru Gardens were teeming with birds ­ low-flying swifts
and swallows, and Red-collared, White-winged and Jackson's Widowbirds
staking out their territories in the growing grass. "Spring" flowers were
out: White gladiolus, brilliant blue and orange Commelinas, white rock
violets. 

Near the fig and poison arrow trees covered in fruits, we noted two very
different individuals of White-headed Barbet. One bird was snowy white, with
black only on the beak, wings, and a small triangle at the top of the back.
The other individual had a dark back, brown lines on the white tail and a
blackish throat.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
