Hi Dave,
I have thoroughly enjoyed this exchange, but I am fascinated as to how
you are going to get the tooth sample to the good doctor!
Best for now
Brian

Hi Dave and All,

I'm not sure if the orthodontist is aware but crocodilians have both
permanent and deciduous teeth. That may explain why some teeth (older) may
be permanently discoloured and others (deciduous) appear fresher.

Either way, this is a fascinating conversation.

Cheers for now,
Adam

Interesting! The first photo looks liked mottled enamel/floursis seen in
human teeth .... in the second photo however, some teeth are still white
.... in humans that feature is seen when there is a 'developmental
disturbance' e.g. an illness/infection during that period of enamel
mineralization (example of intrinsic staining)....and I suspect that
there
is evidence of calculus surface deposits in the second photo (example of
extrinsic staining)....



Tetracycline is also a cause of intrinsic staining..... an analysis of
the
first photo tooth sample would be interesting .... in the second
photo...the croc needs 'to improve' his tooth brushing.

Dave,



Great shot!



I am copying this email to my friend and dentist Dr Dipak Chudasama who
may be able to provide some input.



My suspicion is of high fluoride levels, but then again, I may be wrong.



How are you doing?

I spent some time at the hyena dam recently and noticed that the crocs
had
brown teeth. The attached images are of 2 different crocs and I also saw
a
third with brown teeth. Any ideas anyone.
