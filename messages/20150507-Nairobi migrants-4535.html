Greetings birders

Visited Nairobi National Park on April 30th with Sheena Orr, Ben Allen and
Jennifer Oduori. Northern migrants were still on their way, although in
small numbers ­ Common Greenshank,  Wood Sandpiper, Little Stint;
Red-backed, Isabelline and Lesser Grey Shrikes; Barn Swallow and Willow
Warbler. Also two White Storks at Athi Basin dam that appeared to be in poor
condition.

A southern migrant, Madagascar Bee-eater, and an intra-African or Indian
migrant, Jacobin (black-and-white) Cuckoo, had arrived. The local widowbirds
­ White-winged, Red-collared and Jackson's Widowbirds ­ were displaying in
the grasslands. 

The wild white gladiolus was flowering everywhere. Following the recent
discussion, we noted that the crocodiles at Hyena Dam had brown teeth
whereas the crocodiles at Athi Basin Dam had white teeth; and several
leopard tortoises has recently been released near Nagolomon Dam

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
