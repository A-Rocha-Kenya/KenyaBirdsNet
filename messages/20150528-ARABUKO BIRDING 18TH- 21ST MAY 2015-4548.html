Hi Birdes i am back to bird at Arabuko and had a good time on revising my birding site. all this i was to prepare for a photographer who has accumulated birds photos. Mr Jacques Pittaloud his driver Matthew and professional guide Sammy Mugo.<br>During my finding of the special six on the day one before they arrived i managed to get Amani Sun bird, Sokoke pipit and East coast akalat where i used my knowledge of mimic of sound at my past sighting which ihad used before i went to Tana Delta working in DFID project which ended on end April. day two i went to search the roosting of sokoke scorps owl this is when i asked directions for the previous findings from Davide Ngala, i was very happy to find the sokoke scops Owls at a day roosting 9.45am and this was exciting to me as i had to 12 km in the forest.this same day my guest arrived at Arabuko visitors at 4.30 pm being fromTaitahills at morning looking Taita white eye taita apalis and others and i had to take them to see Scops owl before it was dark for photographing.<br>Day three we spend the whole day in the Arabuko forest searching more birds and Clarcke&#39;s Weaver was a dream we did not see even one, though we had that at Dakatcha were hundreds.<br>Day four we had short morning birding in arabuko again and we saw the Turaco but no photo taken.our birding was only recorded when a bird is photographed more we see but not counted.<br>Enjoy birding<br><p><span><br class="yui-cursor"></span></p></body>
