  <P><SPAN>Hi All</SPAN></P>
  <P><SPAN><BR></SPAN></P>
  <P>We went down to the Olkirimatian Group Conservancy last week for a few 
  nights. The area is looking beautiful as they have had quite a bit of rain. 
  The birdlife is brilliant when it is like this, especially the numbers of 
  breeding weavers, bishops and quelea. The white Throated bee-eaters and 
  cuckoos (African, Black, Black and White, Diderik) were also numerous and 
  calling lots. I would really recommend everyone heading down the Magadi road 
  over the next week or two (be warned the road is awful and all the seasonal 
  rivers were flooded over the road when we drove back on saturday) to witness 
  the breeding spectacle of the weavers - in particular chestnut weavers - and 
  also the large numbers of chestnut sparrows too.</P>
  <P><BR></P>
  <P>The Maasai leave the conservation area when the rains are around as it is 
  left as a 'grass-bank' for dry periods. We therefore had the place to 
  ourselves and were surrounded by lions on our first night, one loan male we 
  found on a night drive - it's an exciting place and so easy to visit. The 
  plains game is abundant and tame and we even saw two elephants.</P>
  <P><BR></P>
  <P>The most interesting bird species for us was a pair of Long-taled 
  Cisticolas. Zimmerman, Turner and Pearson don't mention this area as an area 
  in which they are found so thought it might be of interest to some of you. 
  They were busy birds and moved on quickly.</P>
  <P><BR></P>
  <P>Also I wanted to write sooner to mention a short visit I made to the tea 
  estates in Nandi over Easter. I saw a few nice species in the remnant forest 
  patches including Luhder's Bush-shrike, Mackinnon's Fiscal, Black-throated 
  Wattle-Eye and I managed on two occasions to whistle to a White-Spotted 
  Flufftail and attract it to within a metre of me (I had to sit dead still and 
  be patient but was well worth it!).</P>
  <P><BR></P>
  <P>Look forward to more birding when I'm back in December.</P>
  <P><BR></P>
  <P>Kieran</P>
