      <p>Greetings birders<br>
<br>
Nature Kenya&#39;s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk had winners at the Racecourse<br>
today.<br>
<br>
As soon as we arrived, there was an eye-level view of a Red-chested Cuckoo<br>
and a pair of Black Cuckooshrikes. Birds continued to fill the Trema, Ficus<br>
and Senna trees in front of us, adding up to 44 species in the first hour<br>
and 50 metres, and 67 for the morning (two and a half hours and a bit of a<br>
walk). The big winners, however, were:<br>
<br>
1. Golden-tailed Woodpecker, only the fourth sighting for Nairobi. Brian<br>
Finch notes about their distribution &quot;Closest east is Kibwezi and closest<br>
west is Mara&quot;. But there it was in a forest tree, possibly a Diospyros, a<br>
female with dark forehead and red nape, twice as big as the nearby<br>
Brown-backed Woodpecker, with long streaks on the breast, a greenish back<br>
and a golden tail. We heard its raptor-like call several times. Our last<br>
sighting of this enigmatic bird was at the same place one and a half years<br>
ago.<br>
<br>
2. Bronze-naped Pigeons, altitudinal migrants from the highland forests<br>
visiting Nairobi during the cold season. There were at least two females and<br>
one male, and all participants got at least one good view.<br>
<br>
3. Yellow White-eye? The Trema tree hosted a pair of Montane White-eyes and<br>
several other white-eyes, yellow all over, but with a medium-sized eye-ring<br>
clearly cut by a dark line. It seems to fit Brian Finch&#39;s recent discovery<br>
of Yellow White-eyes in southwestern Nairobi, together with Montane and<br>
Abyssinian White-eyes.<br>
<br>
Wishing you good birding, Fleur<br>
<br>
