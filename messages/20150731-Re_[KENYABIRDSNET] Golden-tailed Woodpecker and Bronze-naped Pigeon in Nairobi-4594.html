    Thanks for this Paula. Very interesting to hear of Leakey's
    observation on monitoring changes in bird ranges - this is in fact <i>exactly</i>
    what the Kenya Bird Map project is able to do and will be used for -
    looking at changes in bird ranges and distribution as well as
    looking at and understanding the effect of climate change. The
    protocol being used will allow us to look at this quite
    specifically. A number of papers have already been published on the
    South African data which follows the same protocol as we do
    including work that shows that Barn Swallows are arriving c.5 days
    later and leaving c.5 days sooner from their non-breeding grounds
    that is very suggestive of a climate change effect.<br>
    <br>
    HOWEVER what we need is many more people who know anything about
    birds to join us and contribute to the atlas project. It is a hugely
    stimulating activity to be involved with, a lot of fun, and
    something that you know you are contributing to a very effective
    conservation project. A smart phone app has been developed for it
    and is just about to go public - a free app that will allow you to
    gather data on the go and will tell you which atlas square you're in
    and warn you when you are leaving it and entering another.. but even
    just using the google maps satellite images to locate your atlas
    square is very interesting and effective.<br>
    <br>
    If you or anyone else reading this, therefore, are keen to get
    involved or know someone who might be, please do register / suggest
    they register and join us.<br>
    <br>
    Thanks!<br>
    <br>

                          <p>Greetings birders<br>
                            <br>
                            Nature Kenya's Wednesday Morning Birdwalk
                            had winners at the Racecourse<br>
                            today.<br>
                            <br>
                            As soon as we arrived, there was an
                            eye-level view of a Red-chested Cuckoo<br>
                            and a pair of Black Cuckooshrikes. Birds
                            continued to fill the Trema, Ficus<br>
                            and Senna trees in front of us, adding up to
                            44 species in the first hour<br>
                            and 50 metres, and 67 for the morning (two
                            and a half hours and a bit of a<br>
                            walk). The big winners, however, were:<br>
                            <br>
                            1. Golden-tailed Woodpecker, only the fourth
                            sighting for Nairobi. Brian<br>
                            Finch notes about their distribution
                            "Closest east is Kibwezi and closest<br>
                            west is Mara". But there it was in a forest
                            tree, possibly a Diospyros, a<br>
                            female with dark forehead and red nape,
                            twice as big as the nearby<br>
                            Brown-backed Woodpecker, with long streaks
                            on the breast, a greenish back<br>
                            and a golden tail. We heard its raptor-like
                            call several times. Our last<br>
                            sighting of this enigmatic bird was at the
                            same place one and a half years<br>
                            ago.<br>
                            <br>
                            2. Bronze-naped Pigeons, altitudinal
                            migrants from the highland forests<br>
                            visiting Nairobi during the cold season.
                            There were at least two females and<br>
                            one male, and all participants got at least
                            one good view.<br>
                            <br>
                            3. Yellow White-eye? The Trema tree hosted a
                            pair of Montane White-eyes and<br>
                            several other white-eyes, yellow all over,
                            but with a medium-sized eye-ring<br>
                            clearly cut by a dark line. It seems to fit
                            Brian Finch's recent discovery<br>
                            of Yellow White-eyes in southwestern
                            Nairobi, together with Montane and<br>
                            Abyssinian White-eyes.<br>
                            <br>
                            Wishing you good birding, Fleur<br>
