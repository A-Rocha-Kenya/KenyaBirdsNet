Greetings Birders


It was quality rather than quantity on Nature Kenya's Wednesday Morning
Birdwalk to the Nairobi Arboretum on August 5:


We had good views of two Turaco species: the resident Hartlaub's Turaco (at
least two, perhaps four individuals) and the unusual Purple-crested Turaco,
who has been resident in the Arboretum for the past three years.


Also good views of Silvery-cheeked Hornbill, Black Cuckooshrike and several
brilliant male African Paradise Flycatchers.


The Arboretum itself had been battered and littered by last weekend's freak
hailstorm. There were fallen trees, broken branches, shredded leaves, and
the riverbanks were wall-to-wall plastic bags, all from the recent storms.
We met the Forester, who was busy trying to organize repairs to the damage.


Wishing you good birding, Fleur
