Dear Jonathan,
Madagascar Plover is not likely to make Kenya, I think you probably
mean Pratincole?
Best wishes
Brian

Hi birders i am back to Tana and hope to give out my sightings time to
time.
i and my two friends have been to the delta by boat from northern side of
the rive, Onkolde harbor,
The birds population has real reduce as the land has been so dry from over
grazing and water level has real reduced.
list of few
Goliath heron, African spoonbill ,spur-winged plover, wool necked stork,
yellow bill stork,fish eagle,and Madagascar plover were arround with few
Northen carmine bee eaters.
the list has common birds and time we visited was brief and hot.
Thank you
Jonathan
