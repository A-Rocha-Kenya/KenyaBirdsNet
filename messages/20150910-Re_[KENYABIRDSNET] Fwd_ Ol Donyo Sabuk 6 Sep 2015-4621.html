Dear Darcy,
I am in Madagascar at present and for the next three weeks. I was
fascinated by your Ol Donyio Sabuk report. and intrigued by your
white-eye. Birds in the Montane/Kikuyu groups when on mountain islands
seem to take on a racial identity or speciate. Britton gives no
mention of the species on such an isolated mountain, the range of our
more familiar kikuyuenis being a continuous distribution from Mt Kenya
to Nairobi highlands. No-where in this range is it isolated and I am
wondering if anyone has ever looked at the Ol Doniyo birds before
because there cannot be an interchange with the main distribution and
the birds should be isolated and evolving an identity. Do you have any
more images?
Very best
Brian

Hi all,

I was up Ol Donyo Sabuk yesterday.  Being hopelessly dry in Thika, I was
hoping the mountain would produce more birds.

It certainly wasn't my best day up there, but I managed some nice birds.  I
finally managed to get some photographs of the brown-capped weavers, which
I usually see, but always in terrible light and with a strained neck.
Yesterday I was very lucky to photograph both the male and the female. They
were both doing their nuthatch-like feeding style of probing under the
lichens as they scooted up and around a tall tree.

I also managed this rather distant photo of a montane white-eye.  As
further support that despite the top of this mountain being only c. 2100m
the forests at the top support montane species.

Other non-montane species were groups of cabinis's greenbul, and singles of
augur buzzard, yellow-rumped tinkerbird, brown-crowned tchagra.

On the mammal side of things, I did manage to see and photograph a troop of
colobus monkeys.  While seeing them there wasn't surprising, I can't recall
ever having run into them before on the mountain.
Others were syke's monkeys and baboons heard from afar, and dwarf mongoose.

While Ol Donyo is not the easiest park to see birds, it has a lovely bit of
forest at the top and apart from some semi-drunk hikers I didn't encounter
anyone else.  Karibu Thika!

Cheers, Darcy
