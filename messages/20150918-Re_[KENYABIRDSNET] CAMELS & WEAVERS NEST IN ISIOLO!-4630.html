    Hi John and others<br>
    <br>
    Very interesting record! Please write it up for Scopus or
    Ornithological Observations (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://oo.adu.org.za/">http://oo.adu.org.za/</a>).<br>
    <br>
    There are 2 records of elephants eating weaver nests for the grass.<br>
    <br>
    Steyn P 2000 Snack attack. Africa - Birds &amp; Birding 5(2):17<br>
    Here Peter Steyn comments on a photo taken in Zimbabwe of an
    elephant feeding on White-browed Sparrow-weaver nests during a
    drought.<br>
    <br>
    Earlé R 1974 Sappige Happies. Northern Transvaal Ornithological
    Society Newsletter 14:4<br>
    Here an elephant ate 30-40 nests of the Cape Weaver in Addo, some
    may have had eggs or chicks - the elephant would probably hardly
    notice these. This article is in Afrikaans.<br>

                Isiolo town being small in size its bird life is amazing
                from dry land species to big raptors soaring in clear
                sky on  hot dusty days. The variety of habitats attracts
                different species of birds, from shrub land,rocky &amp;
                patches of grasslands. One of the spectacular views of
                birds I ever saw was Eastern Paradise Whydah, Pin-tailed
                Whydah,Steel-blue Whydah and a big flock of Red-billed
                Quelea on their bright plumage on the same tree. Bat
                hawks making fast hunts before dark will also add your

                Due to lack of enough rain for vegetation during dry
                season somali herders from as far as Moyale travels with
                their camel in to Isiolo-meru area in search of
                vegetation, they go purchasing Euphombia tirucalli
                planted around homesteads by Ameru community members.
                The purchase act as a source of income when there is no
                crops in their farms.</div>

                recording birds in a company of a local guide we saw a
                herd of about 250 camels the biggest I had never seen
                before. Using my binoculars I noticed two of them were
                doing something strange on a dry leafless Acacia
                tortilis, at a close range I noticed that they were
                actually enjoying White-browed Sparrow Weaver's nests,
                hurriedly picked my phone to capture the moment but
                wasn't enough! Had a brief conversation with herder who
                mentioned that the big herbivores will go for the nests
                whenever they have an opportunity. What happens to eggs
                and the chics inside the nests??</div>
