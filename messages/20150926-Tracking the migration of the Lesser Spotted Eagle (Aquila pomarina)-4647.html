Dear all,

 
 <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.Satellite-Telemetry.de">www.Satellite-Telemetry.de</a> is the website of the World Working Group on Birds of Prey (WWGBP) where some of the results of our satellite telemetry studies are presented. Now we have started again to show the autumn migration 2015 of our raptors marked with satellite tags. 
 
              
              For reasons of time, only the course of migration of the Lesser Spotted Eagle (Aquila pomarina), in cooperation with the BirdLife Germany federal office (NABU), is dealt with here, with a very rough presentation of the course of migration. In order to show this online in as near as possible to real time, only one fix per day is used, although many more than 100 fixes are received daily from some birds.               
                           
                            
                           
              Migration within Germany is not shown, in order to guarantee the anonymity of the eyrie sites of this extremely rare species.            
             
             
 The breakdown of the Lesser Spotted Eagles (breeding success etc. in 2015) beeing tracked during autumn migration in 2015 will be updated. There is a short report on the past course of migration.             
                           
                            
                           
              The birds are individually designated by their transmitter number and in most cases they have also been given names, some of them by the eyrie monitor.             
             
             
                           
             
 Best wishes,
 
 WWGBP
