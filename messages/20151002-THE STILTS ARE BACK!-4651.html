Dear All,
Having been in Madagascar all September, and arriving back last night,
I was unpacking at 12.30am when a noisy group of stilts flew over.
Apparently they also flew over a few days ago when the moon was full.
I expect they will be daily from now on, and I bet when they leave the
mystery of their daily passage will remain that way!
I was in the paddock at 6.30am but it was quiet. A party of 18
Eurasian Bee-eaters were about, and whilst I am writing there is a
happy Willow Warbler singing from the flowering xanthophloea outside.
Best to all
Brian
