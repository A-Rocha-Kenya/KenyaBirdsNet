Dear All,
I have just heard from Nik Borrow that when he was leading his last
group and staying at Simba Lodge in Buffalo Springs he found all
chestnut crowned Somali Sparrow types, that showed the greyish
underparts of House Sparrows. This is both interesting and at the same
time disconcerting news. Everyone should now pay special attention to
House Sparrows, especially in the remoter areas as more might come to
light. It's possible that House/Somali Sparrows are increasing in
Somalia and the urge to wander in the genes of House Sparrow is
responsible for the spread putting our northern yellow Somali Sparrows
at risk,
Best for now
Brian
