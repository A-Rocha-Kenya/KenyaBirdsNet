Even though I am a human nutritionist, I have always found animal behaviour to be quite intriguing. Here is an excerpt from Galen's article that relates to the Elephant-Shrew's relationship with the robin-chat (and perhaps by extension the spotted thrush too). And to think this was written in 1973 and still observed in 2015 is something...</div><div dir="ltr" id="yiv1409410071yui_3_16_0_1_1445939298262_5388"><br id="yui_3_16_0_1_1445939298262_6681"></div><div dir="ltr" id="yiv1409410071yui_3_16_0_1_1445939298262_5388"><i id="yui_3_16_0_1_1445939298262_6700">'While the elephant-shrew feeds on what it has found in
the holes it is often intently watched by a red-capped
robin-chat perched nearby. When the elephant-shrew finally finishes and moves on, the small orange and gray bird hops
in and carefully picks out any small invertebrates that have not been eaten (since the elephant-shrew is a sloppy eater) it
may pick up bits and pieces left behind. The robin-chat also hawks insects flushed by the elephant-shrew as it forages
through the leaf litter. It is not uncommon to see an elephant shrew moving along and close behind it in the under growth, a robin-chat hopping from branch to branch waiting for
an opportunity to snoop down and snap an insect out of the air. This relationship between bird and mammal, which is similar to
that of the cattle egret and cow, is possibly one-sided, for no
apparent advantage or disadvantage is gained by the elephant shrew
from having the robin-chat foraging along with it. During
the rainy season the elephant-shrews are followed and plagued
by a tight cloud of a dozen or mole mosquitoes. It may be that
the robin-chat also hawks some of these insects, although without evidence this is only speculation'</i><br></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
