Dear All,

Since the rain with the first good shower on 23rd, then a wet night on
29th, I have kept records of birds in the paddock between
6.20am-8.30am, on 20th-29th, but times varying within that period. I
have no idea what there has been the rest of the day other than what I
hear.

Here are the more interesting observations and migrant status.

23rd Goliath Heron
This was a shock flying up the valley, and no doubt in NNP within a
minute of being lost to view. I have only ever seen two individuals in
the Park, and maybe none for over a dozen years. They are very, very
rare in Nairobi district.

Bat-Hawk every day bar 21st, 28th &amp; 29th
Hopefully nesting in IUCN.

Harrier sp 21st  25th
Both females and unidentified, and both circling south.

24th Eurasian Buzzard
The first of the season, a dark bird, none since.

27th Eurasian Hobby
The first of the season flying south, none since.

20th Mottled Swift
A solitary bird and the first for many months.

Common Swift on several dates, up to fifteen feeding overhead.

24th Pallid Swift
This was a time not to have a non-functioning camera. The bird came
over low and in no hurry, with the binoculars the extensive white
throat, and barred underparts could be easily seen, as well as absent
of translucency in the secondaries. Still not on the Kenya list, but
had my Lumix not been useless with no direct view-finder working then
I would have taken video, and maybe the evidence would have been
there. This is far from being the first Pallid over the garden, and in
the past we have had flocks feeding low over the trees.

25th Eurasian Roller
One winging southwards, last year we only had them flying north on their return.

24th Eurasian Golden Oriole
Where are they? There were five on the really early date of 4th, with
an adult male singing, then four on 24th, and none since. This time
last year there were up to ten per day in the last week of October.

23rd-29th Barn Swallows very few
Just a few going south, no flocks and no marked passage.

23rd-25th House Martin
Up to six in the early mornings, often feeding with Common Swifts.

Willow Warbler 3-5 daily, 29th (15)
Although present every day in October, only small numbers. After
persistent rain on 29th there were fifteen feeding in the large Fever
Tree with other migrants. When the light got brighter, every migrant
disappeared.

22nd 27th 28th Blackcap fem/male/fem 29th (6)
Just singles until six in the Fever Tree on 29th.

28th Garden Warbler 29th (2)
Just one bird, then two in the Fever Tree on 29th.

29th Semi-collared Flycatcher
Best passerine migrant we have ever had, one sitting with all the
warblers in the Fever Tree on 29th. There are only a handful of
Nairobi records, and incredibly there has never been a record of the
species from NNP, not even an undocumented historical one. (Maybe
there was one today!).

20th Great Blue-eared Starling (4)
Only the second ever record for the paddock.

22nd-28th Chestnut Weaver small flocks
Absent in the drought when they would have been expected, but appeared
in small flocks at the start of the rains. I am sure it used to be the
reverse in Nairobi.

Best to all
Brian
