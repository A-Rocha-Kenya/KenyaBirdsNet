Dear All,
Although I had a clear view of the flycatcher this morning, it was for
about two seconds in morning gloom, and it flew off. I spent an hour
looking for it, but to no avail. At 11.30am it got brighter and I went
out for another 45 minutes, but the only passerine migrant I saw was a
few Barn Swallows.
At 3.00pm I tried again, and there it was in the Grevillea robustas
hawking from the highest branches. I phoned Nigel Hunter and he came
around and had a successful twitch as it was a lifer for him.
Attached are two images, one perched and a really strange one in flight.
Best to all
Brian
