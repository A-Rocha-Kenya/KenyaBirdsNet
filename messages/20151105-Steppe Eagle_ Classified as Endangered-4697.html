Dear all,



Congratulations and thanks to Igor, Elvira and all friends and colleagues in Russia and elsewhere who have worked so hard to provide the information that has led to this decision.
  


Hopefully this new categorisation will increase the likely success of research funding applications for researchers who are working to better understand the vulnerabilities of Steppe Eagle populations in breeding and wintering areas, and along migration routes.
 


Very best wishes 

Bernd Meyburg
