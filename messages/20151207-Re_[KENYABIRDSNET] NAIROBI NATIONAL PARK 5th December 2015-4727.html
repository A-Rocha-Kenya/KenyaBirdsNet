NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 5th December 2015<BR>
<BR>
Dear All,<BR>
On 5th December, Nigel Hunter and myself entered at Main Gate of<BR>
Nairobi National Park. By 6.40am the car-park was thronging in<BR>
tourists and tour vehicles and it appeared that there has been a major<BR>
upsurge in visitors which was very nice to see. There had been no rain<BR>
overnight, but it was still impossible to get to several places, such<BR>
as the Langata Gate/Kisembe Forest area, back and sides of Hyena Dam,<BR>
the Run-off, the inside road to Eland Hollow, nor was it possible to<BR>
get there from Karen PC Dam or off the East Gate Road, most of Athi<BR>
Dam and Rhino Circuit.<BR>
<BR>
Along the entrance road there was an Emerald Cuckoo, the first of the<BR>
days Nightingales and a couple of Black-and-White Mannikins. Ivory<BR>
Burning site was quiet, there were a few more Nightingales and a<BR>
female Amur Falcon flew over towards Nagalomon Dam and disappeared.<BR>
The acacias were empty of birdlife, and there was a Zanzibar Greenbul<BR>
singing back in the scrub. There was no sign of the thick-knee on the<BR>
causeway and Nagalomon Dam would have been very quiet if it were not<BR>
for the return of the Sacred Ibis to breed where they had after the<BR>
long rains. This squeezes out other water birds and two Darters had<BR>
taken refuge away from them. There were over twenty Black-crowned<BR>
Night-Herons though. The water level is very high, but there was a<BR>
Swamphen, and fifteen mixed Green and Wood Sandpipers around the edge.<BR>
<BR>
We tried the back road to Hyena Dam but had to turn back in the dip,<BR>
so never managed to see the new swamp, or the swampy area along the<BR>
edge of Hyena Dam. There was a Scaly Francolin calling which was the<BR>
first for some time, and a few more Nightingales. We retraced and took<BR>
the main road to Hyena Dam. There were six White-faced Whistling-Duck<BR>
which were our only non-Egyptian Geese waterfowl today. They were<BR>
sitting in the water running across the road and like so many birds<BR>
around Hyena Dam, only going to budge if hard pressed. Apart form the<BR>
days only Yellow-billed Stork, there was a very nice adult male<BR>
payesii Little Bittern, a very much non-breeding Squacco Heron, and<BR>
single Great and Yellow-billed Egrets. A female Western Marsh Harrier<BR>
came and quartered the swamp, and was the only migrant accipitrine<BR>
today, an adult Fish Eagle rested in the large acacia. The African<BR>
Water Rails continue to become more and more extravert, there were<BR>
four seen, with one pair allo-preening then mating right in the open<BR>
whilst standing in grass only a few inches high, there were two<BR>
Swamphens and not to be outdone by the rails, one just fed below the<BR>
window as we crossed the causeway. The four Long-toed Plovers have now<BR>
become five, having been joined by another adult, there were still<BR>
three Spur-winged Plovers with the many Blacksmiths, and two adults<BR>
and an immature African Jacana. In the migrant wader line was a single<BR>
Common Snipe, but some twenty-five Wood and six Green Sandpipers, both<BR>
species being very widespread today. There was a Sedge Warbler<BR>
skulking in the same bush as one that shared it with a tame Eurasian<BR>
Reed Warbler last year, at the corner of the causeway, although not<BR>
seen anywhere else today, the immediate vicinity of Hyena Dam held<BR>
seven Whinchats, the only other migrant being a few Barn Swallows<BR>
which were widespread in small numbers.<BR>
<BR>
Taking the road that circuits the run-off was our only<BR>
Black-shouldered Kite of the day, a couple of some six (mainly heard)<BR>
Rosy-breasted Longclaws, whilst along the Mokoyeti were six Eurasian<BR>
Bee-eaters and the first of just three Willow Warblers today.<BR>
<BR>
It was quiet at Karen PD Dam, a gathering of four Hamerkops was an<BR>
unusual sight in the Park, but there was only a male Yellow-crowned<BR>
Bishop in full breeding plumage on its own. A detour to East Gate gave<BR>
us a male Marico Sunbird, and crossing the plains there was the first<BR>
of only two Northern Wheatears on the murrum quarry, (which also had a<BR>
solitary Chandler&#8217;s Reedbuck), a male Hartlaub&#8217;s Bustard, a<BR>
Secretarybird and a couple of Pangani Longclaws. Our first of two<BR>
adult Turkestan Shrikes, the only migrant shrike today.<BR>
<BR>
The murrum pit at the top of Athi Dam featured Horace Hippo, but just<BR>
two Greenshank, and along the top of the basin were a singing<BR>
White-tailed Lark and a young male Pied Wheatear. Athi Dam was for the<BR>
best part inaccessible, but there is hardly any edge areas, there was<BR>
a Red-knobbed Coot, but apart from that another two Greenshank and<BR>
three Common Sandpipers completed it, apart from a few of the usual<BR>
Spur-winged Plovers.<BR>
<BR>
The fallen electricity cable rests across the road still, I wonder if<BR>
those horrible pylons have ever had current flowing through them?<BR>
<BR>
Along the Mbagathi we found the a Eurasian Hobby, adult Martial Eagle,<BR>
Kori Bustard, a charming Pygmy Kingfisher and African Hoopoe and a<BR>
pair of Black-faced Waxbills. Perhaps the best birds of the day were<BR>
singing Red-and-Yellow Barbets calling from the Acacia mellifera<BR>
scrub, the first in the Park for at least two years, but they never<BR>
revealed themselves. Kingfisher Picnic Site had a pair of Tawny Eagles<BR>
and a Brown Parisoma.<BR>
<BR>
Grey Crowned Cranes were in small numbers with just three pairs seen,<BR>
and whilst Red-collared Widowbirds were common, few Jackson&#8217;s were<BR>
seen, and the only White-winged were a few female plumaged birds.<BR>
<BR>
When you do not get a palearctic &#8220;fix&#8221; at this time of year, it cannot<BR>
have been a good day. On exiting the Main Gate at 4.00pm, the clerk<BR>
said how many birds did you see today. I replied I doubt if we<BR>
recorded more than 160 species, she said that was a lot to which I<BR>
replied, it feels like our lowest ever. When the species were totalled<BR>
up, we had had an amazing 178 species, so it must have been a good<BR>
day, thank goodness for the Afrotropicals.<BR>
<BR>
Mammals were much confined to the southern end, especially Zebra,<BR>
though a few at Kingfisher. There were a lot of Eland and Kongoni<BR>
about. Three White Rhinos below Impala Lookout, and a Black near the<BR>
Beacon, a very nice and very large Egyptian Mongoose crossed the road<BR>
near Hyena Dam.<BR>
<BR>
Best to all<BR>
