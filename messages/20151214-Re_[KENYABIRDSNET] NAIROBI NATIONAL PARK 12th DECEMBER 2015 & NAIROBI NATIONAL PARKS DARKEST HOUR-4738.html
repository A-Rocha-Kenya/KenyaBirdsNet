<P>NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 12th DECEMBER 2015<BR><BR>Dear All,<BR>This is Nairobi 
National Parks darkest hour. A couple of years ago<BR>when President Kenyatta 
and the Chinese Premier hosted the ceremonial<BR>burning of Elephant and 
Rhinoceros ivory at Ivory Burning Site, they<BR>revealed a monument pledging 
joint efforts to protect the wildlife for<BR>future generations. At this time it 
appears that they were also<BR>negotiating a deal to construct a railway line 
right through the Park<BR>causing major excision of a large part. It would seem 
duplicity on the<BR>part of the Kenya Government to show to the world that it 
was serious<BR>in protecting wildlife and the environment, whilst at the same 
time<BR>planning the demise of one of the countries most important 
wildlife<BR>centres. We can only hope that they see the error of this 
judgement,<BR>and find the alternative wholly outside of NNP.<BR><BR>The 
projected intrusion will cut a great swathe through the northern<BR>parts from 
Ole Sereni Hotel, through Hyena Dam, through Nagalomon Dam,<BR>through Kisembe 
Forest, through Kingfisher Picnic Site and exit near<BR>the Sheldrick Elephant 
Orphanage. All of the above named will be<BR>changed forever, whether through 
the massive irrecoverable destruction<BR>during construction, the loss of 
habitat and the disturbance to<BR>wildlife caused by high speed trains speeding 
through the Park.<BR><BR>Hyena Dam, Nagalomon Dam and the Kisembe and Mokoyeti 
Rivers are the<BR>water sources that keep the Park alive, the construction will 
alter<BR>the water catchment of the Park and affect the entire western 
area.<BR>Hyena and Nagalomon Dams are the most important wetlands for birds 
as<BR>well as Hippos and other wildlife in the entire Park.<BR><BR>The Kisembe 
Forest is the most important area for globally Critically<BR>Endangered Black 
Rhinoceros as well as the most important area for the<BR>very local Brachylaena 
and Olive forest in Kenya, which has all but<BR>disappeared outside of its 
borders. The face that the Kenya Government<BR>will be showing to the world is 
that it has no concern about the<BR>continued existence of Black Rhinos in 
Kenya, and that any resemblance<BR>to caring for the environment is merely 
façade.<BR>The Kisembe Forest has a good variety of birds, and is now the 
major<BR>area of White-backed Vulture breeding in East Africa. This is now 
a<BR>critically endangered species, poised on the brink of 
extinction.<BR>Notwithstanding that the forested areas along the Kisembe River 
is<BR>without doubt the most scenically beautiful part of the entire 
Park.<BR><BR>The Nairobi Pipit Anthus kisembensis, is found nowhere else in 
the<BR>world, other than in this forest which is why its scientific 
name<BR>bears the name of the forest and river. Ocassionally found in 
IUCN,<BR>the population is endemic to Kisembe Ridge with the eastern limit 
just<BR>beyond Ivory Burning Site. This entire species range is along 
the<BR>proposed path for the railway. It may have been more widespread at 
one<BR>time, but now has its only refuge in the Kisembe Forest, and only 
a<BR>handful of pairs. No bird on the planet faces such a dire threat 
to<BR>their continued existence, and its disappearance will be a 
suppurating<BR>stain on the reputation of Kenya, as a country dedicated to 
the<BR>protection of wildlife, …for ever.<BR><BR>The dams in the glades around 
Kisembe Forest hold several pairs of the<BR>Globally threatened Grey Crowned 
Cranes, fast disappearing throughout<BR>their range as the habitat is changed, 
Nairobi National Park is a very<BR>important and currently secure breeding 
habitat for this iconic<BR>species with very high breeding success 
rate.<BR><BR>Returning to Vultures, throughout the range of the species the 
decline<BR>in numbers over the past ten years has been between 90-95%. 
Everywhere<BR>that is except for Nairobi National Park. Over these same ten 
years in<BR>spite of the tumbling numbers of these once common birds, NNP 
has<BR>remained stable. The vultures are still a common species, many 
pairs<BR>successfully raise young in the Kisembe Forest requiring the 
tall<BR>trees for nesting. The importance as a refuge for this species 
cannot<BR>be overemphasised, the construction of the railway line, is this 
going<BR>to be the nail in the coffin of White-backed Vulture in East 
Africa?<BR><BR>On 12th December, I saw fourteen Ruppell’s Griffon Vultures 
together<BR>which is a very encouraging sight. This species has suffered the 
same<BR>fate as White-backed with 95% drop in numbers. In Kenya one of 
the<BR>only two colonies at Hell’s Gate, has all but disappeared 
through<BR>disturbance to the breeding site. Fourteen now represents a 
large<BR>percentage of the birds that exist, and whilst they do not breed 
in<BR>the Park, it is obviously an exceedingly important feeding refuge 
for<BR>them. In other National Parks where vultures where once a common 
site,<BR>very few to none are reported now.<BR><BR>The gravity of the situation 
facing continued existence of all of<BR>these species thanks to the sanctuary of 
Nairobi National Park must<BR>not be taken lightly.<BR><BR>The disturbance of 
the wildlife to the high-speed trains within the<BR>Park cannot be calculated, 
but will certainly have a very drastic<BR>series of repercussions that will 
detrimentally and adversely affect<BR>them. Visitors to the Park will have to 
endure the sight and sounds<BR>associated with the intrusion, the peaceful 
ambience will be shattered<BR>never to return. The Park will receive fewer 
visitors as its<BR>reputation as an eyesore with diminishing wildlife 
will<BR>internationally pervade, and what then?<BR><BR>Should you be able to 
contribute in making this a globally aware<BR>crisis, please do endeavour to 
circulate because the Kenya Government<BR>must be stopped from taking this huge 
step which will irreversibly<BR>threaten the very existence of globally 
endangered species, as well as<BR>the iconic Nairobi National Park 
itself.<BR><BR>Now the latest news……..<BR><BR>At 6.40am Nigel Hunter and myself 
entered Nairobi National Park<BR>through the Langata Gate where we rapidly 
completed the formalities<BR>and were in the Park in no time having been 
expertly processed. There<BR>had been no rain in a week, and everything was 
returning back to<BR>normal enabling us to reach all the intended destinations. 
Throughout<BR>the Park there was abundant verdant and tall pasture. Most of the 
day<BR>was bright and sunny, getting hotter in the afternoon just 
before<BR>there were a few heavy but brief showers.<BR><BR>Our first stop was 
the Vlei near the entrance, the grass was a bit<BR>high for swamp species, 
although twenty Wood Sandpipers were present<BR>and at least one Yellow Wagtail. 
Whilst looking at the open area, we<BR>also found a Blackcap and two Willow 
Warblers in the bushes. There was<BR>nothing at all on Hippogrebe Pond, when we 
continued the small circuit<BR>back to the Kisembe bridge through the forest, 
our passage was<BR>temporarily blocked by an enormous Black Rhinoceros which 
trotted off<BR>into the bush, instantly fading from view.<BR><BR>There was also 
nothing on the Langata Dam, although the days only<BR>Common Whitethroat was 
along the road, and descending to Nagalomon Dam<BR>we had our first of four 
Tawny Eagles, the first of two Bateleurs, and<BR>first of four pairs of Grey 
Crowned Cranes. At the dam there was a<BR>great deal of Sacred Ibis activity 
where the birds were nest building,<BR>the Black-crowned Night-Herons which 
might also be nesting were more<BR>discrete. In the typha was a female Little 
Bittern of unknown race,<BR>and scattered Wood and Green Sandpipers along the 
margin. A Spotted<BR>Thick-knee was back in the usual spot on the drift and from 
here to<BR>the adjacent Ivory Burning Site there was a pale Booted Eagle 
(what<BR>was probably the same bird was seen twice more during the 
morning).<BR>This is my first for the season, and I have not heard of others. As 
a<BR>visitor it is nearly two months late. In the bushes were 
several<BR>Nightingales, a brief Spotted Flycatcher which was the only one 
today,<BR>and a couple of Eurasian Bee-eaters with sunning Klaas’ Cuckoo 
and<BR>male Variable Sunbird for close company (see image), and one 
Eastern<BR>Honeybird was also present.<BR><BR>Taking the back road to Hyena Dam, 
there was a Sprosser singing along<BR>the road in thick cover, but little else, 
nor was there actually much<BR>on the new swamp, but Hyena Dam whilst it has 
lost some recent species<BR>was still interesting. In the duck line were four 
White-faced<BR>Whistling-Duck and a pair of Red-billed Teal, whilst wading 
birds<BR>included the only African Spoonbill for the day, and although 
no<BR>egrets other than Cattle, there were three Squacco Herons which 
could<BR>very well be the first time three have been seen together in the 
Park.<BR>Waders were few, apart from numerous Wood and Green Sandpipers 
there<BR>were no other palearctic species, but the dam still held the 
five<BR>Long-toed and three Spur-winged Plovers and two African Jacanas. 
The<BR>days only Darter was flying over, they seem to have been displaced 
by<BR>the crowding Sacred Ibis on Nagalomon Dam. Other birds were two<BR>African 
Fish Eagles, two Purple Swamphen, though after the extravert<BR>show last week, 
African Water Rails were neither seen nor heard, the<BR>typha held two Sedge 
Warblers, one of which was in remarkably good<BR>voice.<BR><BR>We drove around 
to the Mokoyeti Bridge, where in the acacia woodland<BR>were several Eurasian 
Bee-eaters, a noisy pair of Red-faced Cisticolas<BR>(all ten species were seen 
again this week), a Brown Parisoma and the<BR>only other Willow Warbler of the 
day. Continuing to Olmanyi Dam, the<BR>only species was our only Little Grebe, 
and heading round to<BR>Kingfisher were the only two Whinchats found today, but 
it was quite<BR>quiet.<BR><BR>By the burnt area were three confiding Shelley’s 
Francolins, but no<BR>hoped for migrants here, and the murrum pits near Maasai 
Gate gave us<BR>the first of only two Northern Wheatears, and first of five 
Turkestan<BR>Shrikes. We stopped for lunch by the Mbagathi River below the 
Baboon<BR>Cliffs, and the first Hildebrandt’s Francolin for a long time 
was<BR>calling, although I hear they are regular at Emma-Coco just 
outside<BR>the Park. The days only Common Buzzard was here and a couple 
of<BR>Long-billed Pipits. On the flooded ford near the Mbagathi was 
an<BR>attractive adult Striated Heron.<BR><BR>The vulture-bathing pools above 
Athi Dam had just four White-backs but<BR>it was too early for the main arrival, 
Horace Hippo was here but the<BR>only bird was a Greenshank that seems to be 
here permanently.<BR>Continuing on to Athi Dam was another Shelley’s Francolin, 
single<BR>White-bellied and Hartlaub’s Bustards, a male Pied Wheatear and 
the<BR>numerous open grassland species. Red-collared and Jackson’s are 
in<BR>good numbers almost throughout the Park, but White-winged are 
very<BR>scarce at present. Rosy-breasted Longclaws are also quite numerous 
and<BR>we had three Pangani Longclaws. Athi Dam was accessible, and some 
mud<BR>is starting to appear, there was a solitary White Stork, two 
Fish<BR>Eagles that were not the birds seen at Hyena Dam in the morning, 
some<BR>six Spur-winged and two Kittlitz’s Plovers, but with them a 
moulting<BR>adult Little Ringed Plover, with seven Greenshank and four 
Common<BR>Sandpipers.<BR><BR>We looked at Rhino Circuit but did not find 
anything of note, then<BR>continued to Cheetah Gate as far as the fallen 
Electricity Cable<BR>across the road. Many vultures were congregating on the 
tops of trees<BR>along the river, a remarkable sight of fourteen Ruppell’s 
Vultures<BR>closely huddled amongst the White-backs. Nairobi National Park is 
very<BR>likely the single most important refuge for these two vultures 
whose<BR>populations continue to drop out of sight. Also it is fairly 
certain<BR>that more White-backed Vultures nest in NNP that anywhere else in 
East<BR>Africa (if not Africa), and they are very successful here.<BR>Three 
Open-billed Storks were feeding in a flooded lugga, a Eurasian<BR>Hobby appeared 
after the first shower, then a Kori Bustard was along<BR>the roadside, one 
Laughing Dove was associating with Ring-necks, a<BR>pair of African Hoopoes were 
cavorting, a pair of Red-and-Yellow<BR>Barbets were duetting, and a pair of 
d’Arnaud’s Barbets were seen,<BR>(all seven Barbet species were recorded today), 
the only Red-backed<BR>Shrike of the day was a male, a Speckle-fronted Weaver 
was carrying<BR>nest material, a stunning breeding pair of Lesser Masked Weavers 
fed<BR>in acacia mellifera, and the days only Tree Pipit looked out of 
place<BR>on top of an acacia mellifera as well.<BR><BR>Time now to return to 
Main Entrance, near the beacon in the grassy<BR>valley an male Amur Falcon was 
attacking a female Montagu’s Harrier,<BR>both male and female Pallid Harriers 
were skimming over the swathe,<BR>the only Black-shouldered Kite today was here, 
and a pair of<BR>Lappet-faced Vultures posed on a Balanites. A check of both 
Karen PC<BR>Dam and Eland Hollow failed to produce, but nearby on the 
more<BR>recently burnt area (last year) were three Temminck’s Coursers. A 
last<BR>stop at Hyena Dam before leaving resulted in a Lesser Kestrel 
flying<BR>by, what looked like last weeks female Western Marsh Harrier 
was<BR>hunting over the area, but the nicest find was an adult Great 
Spotted<BR>Eagle which is almost certainly the bird that lived here early in 
the<BR>year from January to March.<BR><BR>Barn Swallows were scattered but no 
large concentrations, only a few<BR>pairs of Lesser Striped Swallows and not 
many Red-rumped. The<BR>grasslands are teaming with small Cisticolas with Desert 
being heard<BR>throughout, but of course Pectoral-patch greatly outnumbered 
them.<BR>However the commonest bird of the day was in all likelihood 
Siffling<BR>Cisticola, which come out of the woodwork when breeding season 
in<BR>here, although undoubtedly present all year. The total number 
of<BR>species recorded today was 207, though some amazingly common birds<BR>were 
just never encountered. Just to put the Parks diversity into<BR>perspective, 
last Saturday we recorded a staggering 51 species not<BR>recorded 
today!!!<BR><BR>We were through the gate at 5.40pm having had a superb day 
albeit with<BR>a slow start.<BR><BR>Mammals were largely along the Mbagathi, and 
as is usual many had left<BR>the Park after the rains. Last week the place 
appeared full of Eland,<BR>but today we did not see one! The only Lion was right 
near the Hippo<BR>Pools. A Serval crept through long grass near Maasai Gate, and 
Suni<BR>were plentiful in the forest, although repeatedly reported 
as<BR>Dik-Diks!<BR><BR>Best to all<BR>Brian<BR><BR>MONTAGE FOR 12TH DECEMBER
