<div dir="ltr"><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><br clear="all"></div>Hi all, <br><br></div>Martin Odino and I just returned from a 6-day trip spent mostly in Tsavo East, and more briefly in Tsavo West and Chuylus. It was to be a vulture-focused trip but due to the timing of being there during the rains, it turned into quite a breeding bird spectacle.  In order not to get too carried away, I&#39;ll only touch on a few highlights. <br><br></div>One of the most stunningly visible birds were Golden Pipits, which prior to this trip I&#39;d only see brief sightings of single males.  We only saw them in Tsavo East, but we saw roughly 20-30  males. One of the most striking things about this bird is that it is more colourful under its wings, than it is above.  Why??  Well this quickly became evident when I watched its display, which was a curious showy mix of all manner of seemingly narcissistic behaviour.  It raised one wing and then the next (photo 1).  Leading to it&#39;s parachuting descent to the ground with wings held high, which unfortunately I didn&#39;t get a photo of as it passed by in a blur of yellow.  This combined with its mohawk &#39;hairdo&#39; and fanned tail (photo 2) has to put the displays of this bird into the list of all-time great performances.  <br><br></div>Paradise whydahs (photo) were everywhere, including outside the parks in the areas east of Kitui.  They were often seen together with Straw-tailed whydahs, and at one point with a Steel blue whydah.  Pin-tailed whydahs were also fairly common.  <br><br></div>Jacobin&#39;s cuckoos were about 10-15 individuals, along with 2 Levaillant&#39;s.  Also, at least 5 Eurasian cuckoos were in Tsavo East. <br><br></div>Rollers were also in high numbers.  In Tsavo East, Eurasian Rollers were everywhere, but throughout the trip there were good numbers of Lilac-breasted, Broad-billed and Rufous crowned. <br><br></div>I&#39;m not too good with the larks, but with Martin&#39;s help there were many Flappet larks and a number of Red-winged larks.  <br><br></div>There was a few Montagu harriers, and one Pallid.  Interestingly, there was a rare dark morph of the Eurasian Marsh harrier (photo, blurry but you can see grey tail and otherwise dark feathers). <br><br></div>In Tsavo West there were a number of Madagascar bee eaters (photo), though book mentions they aren&#39;t usually found at this time of year here.  <br><br></div>There were lots of Wahlberg&#39;s eagles. And 1000+ White storks roosted near Voi Gate one night. A Cinereous eagle owl (photo). <br><br></div>In Chuylus we had a very nice morning sighting of an Aardwolf (photo) foraging on the airstrip, rather oblivious to our presence.  And in Tsavo East while trying to find the campsite after dark we ran into four lions crossing the road.<br><br></div>The full lists of (many) species should be available on Kenya Bird Map in the coming days. <br><br></div>One final thing that needs mentioning, has anyone had much experience with mammal density in the section of Tsavo East north of the Galana River and south of the Tiva River, basically the middle section of the park?  The area is seemingly poached out?  with nothing larger than a squirrel observed over 20+kms. <br><br></div>Cheers, Darcy<br><div><br>  <br><div><div><div><br><br><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><br><br><br><br><div><div>-- <br><div class="gmail_signature"><div dir="ltr"><div><div dir="ltr"><div><div dir="ltr"><div><div dir="ltr"><div><div dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:tahoma,sans-serif"><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0)">Darcy Ogada</span><font><span><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"> | Assistant Director of Africa Programs</span> <br></span></font><font><span>The Peregrine Fund | </span></font><font color="#0B2AFF"><font><span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.peregrinefund.org/" target="_blank">www.peregrinefund.org</a></span></font></font></span><font><span>  </span></font><font color="#0B2AFF"><font><span></span></font></font><span style="font-family:tahoma,sans-serif"><font color="#0B2AFF"><font><span></span></font></font><span style="border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:0px"><span style="border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:0px"><span style="border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:0px"><span style="border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:0px"><span style="border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:0px"><span style="border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:0px"><span style="border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:0px"><span style="border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:0px"><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-weight:normal;font-style:normal"><font><span>P.O.
