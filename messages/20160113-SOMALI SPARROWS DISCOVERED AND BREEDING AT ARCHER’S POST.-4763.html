Dear All,
I have just received the attached superb images from Kevin Easley, who
photographed the birds at their nest at Archer’s Gate entrance to
Samburu GR last November.

They are unquestionably nominate Somali Sparrows, and coexisting with
House Sparrows. This is as amazing as the discovery of the birds at
Sala Gate Tsavo East.

It would seem that the species is spreading, and maybe they are
already at other sites but so far unrecorded..

Best to all
Brian
