<div>Dear James;    Thanks so much for these details. 
Couple of questions   DATE and any idea of altitude.</div>
<div>I see its in the northern part of the park.  Most definitely
a Striped Flufftail.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Years back I tried playback of calls of the Southern African bird
all over the Mt Kenya moorlands, but never had a response of any
type.  In the 1930&#39;s Meinhertzhagen claimed he had this bird on
Mt Kenya, but with his reputation now in tatters, its difficult to
assess.  </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>The bird also occurs on Elgon and there was a good sighting of
one at 3,200m back in December 1969.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>The type came from Loliondo District astride the Kenya - Tanzania
border back in 1901, it was trodden on by a hunter&#39;s
gun-bearer.   Later in the 70&#39;s  Vince Fayad netted
what he felt was a female in the Ngurumans, but without any actual
specimen or photos that&#39;s another record that was difficult to
assess.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Best of luck on any future visits to the area.  Any list of
birds from these higher altitudes always welcome.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Thanks and very best wishes</div>

<blockquote type="cite">Thanks for your note. I&#39;m thrilled that
my sighting could help figure out this birds habitat
needs.</blockquote>
<blockquote type="cite"><br></blockquote>
<blockquote type="cite">I saw the bird  at the trailhead
that we use to go rock climbing in Dragon&#39;s teeth in the Aberdares.
This area is accessed via the Shamata or Rhino Gate (remarkably fancy
new road for a part of the park nobody visits - hardly anyone besides
climbers seem to go over there).  The habitat is moist
medium-deep tussock grass and it appears that a fire had burnt some of
the taller heather a few years back so that there was no bush story
but standing dead wood in clumps.  We backpacked through quite a
bit of similar habitat to this but it was only on the return to the
vehicle that we flushed anything remotely rail-like.</blockquote>
<blockquote type="cite"><br></blockquote>
<blockquote type="cite">The bird: I knew instantly that it was a
rail and despite never seeing a flufftail I knew by its coloration
that it had to be in that grouping.  He flushed only 10 feet
before me both times within 10 minutes of each other (i kept walking
after him/her).  As i said I could see the red on the tail but I
could also see clearly the red on the head and the black and white
markings on the flanks.</blockquote>
<blockquote type="cite"><br></blockquote>
<blockquote type="cite">I was once an american bird biologist and
I have always been fascinated by rails. A super book actually about
photographing the 5 American rails is Shadowbirds by Burt William. 
I was inspired by the book and tried in vain for a while to get
photographs of Black Rails while working with Yellow-billed Cuckoos in
Arizona.</blockquote>
<blockquote type="cite"><br></blockquote>
<blockquote type="cite">Anyway, hope that helps. Here is the UTM
marker for the site, conveniently at the end of the road (4 wheel but
not far from the quality 2 wheel-appropriate new road from
Shamata).</blockquote>

breed and more frequently vocalise.</blockquote>

Dear James; This is a truly excellent sighting indeed. That<br>
high altitude tussock grassland is indeed the habitat of Striped<br>
Flufftail, and there have been several historical records from
there,<br>
the last being a reported sighting near Satima peak in February
1974.<br>
A flufftail that high up with an all-red tail could only be a<br>
Striped, and so after 42 years its really great to have this. Many<br>
congratulations.<br>
<br>
Could you possibly expand the details for us with a brief account
of<br>
your two sightings, date and particularly the altitude etc. A
brief<br>
description of the bird would also help.<br>
<br>
Thanks and very best wishes<font color="#888888"><br>
