<div>Dear James;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks so much for these details.&nbsp;
Couple of questions&nbsp;&nbsp; DATE and any idea of altitude.</div>
<div>I see its in the northern part of the park.&nbsp; Most definitely
a Striped Flufftail.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Years back I tried playback of calls of the Southern African bird
all over the Mt Kenya moorlands, but never had a response of any
type.&nbsp; In the 1930's Meinhertzhagen claimed he had this bird on
Mt Kenya, but with his reputation now in tatters, its difficult to
assess.&nbsp; </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>The bird also occurs on Elgon and there was a good sighting of
one at 3,200m back in December 1969.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>The type came from Loliondo District astride the Kenya - Tanzania
border back in 1901, it was trodden on by a hunter's
gun-bearer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Later in the 70's&nbsp; Vince Fayad netted
what he felt was a female in the Ngurumans, but without any actual
specimen or photos that's another record that was difficult to
assess.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Best of luck on any future visits to the area.&nbsp; Any list of
birds from these higher altitudes always welcome.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Thanks and very best wishes</div>
<div>Don</div>

<blockquote type="cite">Thanks for your note. I'm thrilled that
my sighting could help figure out this birds habitat
needs.</blockquote>
<blockquote type="cite"><br></blockquote>
<blockquote type="cite">I saw the bird &nbsp;at the trailhead
that we use to go rock climbing in Dragon's teeth in the Aberdares.
This area is accessed via the Shamata or Rhino Gate (remarkably fancy
new road for a part of the park nobody visits - hardly anyone besides
climbers seem to go over there).&nbsp; The habitat is moist
medium-deep tussock grass and it appears that a fire had burnt some of
the taller heather a few years back so that there was no bush story
but standing dead wood in clumps.&nbsp; We backpacked through quite a
bit of similar habitat to this but it was only on the return to the
vehicle that we flushed anything remotely rail-like.</blockquote>
<blockquote type="cite"><br></blockquote>
<blockquote type="cite">The bird: I knew instantly that it was a
rail and despite never seeing a flufftail I knew by its coloration
that it had to be in that grouping.&nbsp; He flushed only 10 feet
before me both times within 10 minutes of each other (i kept walking
after him/her).&nbsp; As i said I could see the red on the tail but I
could also see clearly the red on the head and the black and white
markings on the flanks.</blockquote>
<blockquote type="cite"><br></blockquote>
<blockquote type="cite">I was once an american bird biologist and
I have always been fascinated by rails. A super book actually about
photographing the 5 American rails is Shadowbirds by Burt William.&nbsp;
I was inspired by the book and tried in vain for a while to get
photographs of Black Rails while working with Yellow-billed Cuckoos in
Arizona.</blockquote>
<blockquote type="cite"><br></blockquote>
<blockquote type="cite">Anyway, hope that helps. Here is the UTM
marker for the site, conveniently at the end of the road (4 wheel but
not far from the quality 2 wheel-appropriate new road from
Shamata).</blockquote>

<blockquote type="cite">PS has anyone ever censused for these
guys by playback? I also wonder in what season they might like to
breed and more frequently vocalise.</blockquote>

Dear James; This is a truly excellent sighting indeed. That<br>
high altitude tussock grassland is indeed the habitat of Striped<br>
Flufftail, and there have been several historical records from
there,<br>
the last being a reported sighting near Satima peak in February
1974.<br>
A flufftail that high up with an all-red tail could only be a<br>
Striped, and so after 42 years its really great to have this. Many<br>
congratulations.<br>
<br>
Could you possibly expand the details for us with a brief account
of<br>
your two sightings, date and particularly the altitude etc. A
brief<br>
description of the bird would also help.<br>
<br>
Thanks and very best wishes<font color="#888888"><br>
