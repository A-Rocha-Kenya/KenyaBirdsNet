<div class="moz-text-flowed">Further to the reports of Somali Sparrows from Archer's Post and the 
Tsavo area, a puzzling feature throughout has been the lack of any 
yellow on the underparts on any of the birds photographed, yet the 
lemon-yellow colouration on the underparts is a feature of both the 
nominate form (n.Somalia) as well as in the race fulgens (type 
locality between South Horr and Loiengalani). Birds in the Dida 
Galgalla and around Kapedo in Baringo District also show this feature.
<br>
<br>Back in the 1920's Van Someren collected a number of specimens from 
Marsabit District which are currently housed in the Field Museum, 
Chicago, and thanks to Ben Marks and Nobby Cordeiro there, they have 
kindly examined the Van Someren specimens for us and confirm that 
there is no trace of yellow on any of the specimens.This is in 
contrast to three other specimens in Chicago collected by Paulson 
from near Loiengalani in December 1958 that do show a clear 
lemon-yellow wash on the abdomen and flanks.
<br>
<br>With the report from Mel Ogola of Somali Sparrows at Archer's Post 
during August 2002, it would suggest that maybe we are seeing Somali 
Sparrows moving south from their traditional northern Kenya range. 
Whether these birds with an absence of yellow on the underparts 
represent an undescribed race remains to be seen. Certainly more 
photographs are needed.
