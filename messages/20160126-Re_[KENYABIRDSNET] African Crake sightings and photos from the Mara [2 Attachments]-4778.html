      <div>I had the privilege of birding Mara North Conservancy for a few days<br clear="none">
last week with Ben Mugambi.<br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
In addition to many other nice sightings: we were treated to<br clear="none">
surprisingly long views of an African Crake on January 20 darting in<br clear="none">
and out of an overgrown grassy tire track, and of a January 23 bird in<br clear="none">
flight that flushed at the approach of our vehicle.<br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
Photos of each are attached to this email.<br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
The walking bird was near Elephant Pepper Camp - just east of the<br clear="none">
little wet area downhill in front of the camp.  The flying bird was in<br clear="none">
another damp tallgrass area - about 2/3 of the way between Offbeat<br clear="none">
Mara Camp and Kicheche Mara Camp.<br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
We also had a couple of individuals close at hand calling back and<br clear="none">
forth in the main reserve - while we were eating lunch near Topi<br clear="none">
Plains.<br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
When Ben first spotted the walking bird in the grass, at first we<br clear="none">
thought it might be a Corncrake - which really got my pulse rate up!<br clear="none">
But African Crake was certainly a welcome find.<br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
