Dear All,
On 25th January, Nigel Hunter and myself arrived at the Main Gate at
6.40am and being rapidly processed were soon in the Park. It had been
a mixed week, with some showers and hot sunny days but water levels
were once again up, and there was standing water.

Our first call was at the Ivory Burning Site, where there was little
apart from a few noisy Nightingales. The nearby Nagalomon Dam was a
hive of activity in the Sacred Ibis colony, the young have grown
rapidly and are now looking like Ibis, but still no flight feathers.
All this goes on underneath an adult Fish Eagle, which seems to have
no interest in the Ibis, and likewise the Ibis are not concerned about
him. Well over twenty Black-crowned Night-Herons with very fresh
juveniles, seem to have receded to the back part of the island and the
forefront property is well occupied at present. There was a
yellow-billed Great Egret here, whilst Hyena Dam was to provide a
black-billed Great Egret, and four Darters sat in their normal
positions. Around the edge were 32 Wood Sandpipers with six Green and
a Common, but the first two species were recorded in many places
today.</pre></div></body>
