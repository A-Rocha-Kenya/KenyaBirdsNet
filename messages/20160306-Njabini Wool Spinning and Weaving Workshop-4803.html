<p><span>Dear All,</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p>I am pleased to inform you on behalf of Njabini Wool Crafters, the entrepreneurial arm of the Friends of Kinangop Plateau, that they have a new wool spinning and weaving workshop.&nbsp;<span style="line-height:1.25;word-spacing:normal;">The new workshop is a two-storey building along the Njabini-Engineer road,&nbsp;</span><span style="word-spacing:normal;line-height:1.25;">around 2km from Njabini (Kamurembo). There is off-road parking in front of the building and there are toilets at the back.&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height:1.25;word-spacing:normal;">Please call in if you are in the area or passing through, and please spread the word. It is well worth a visit.</span></p><p><br></p><p>Njabini Wool Crafters pay local sheep farmers a fair price for their wool, which provides the raw material for the multi-coloured patterned rugs, mats, scarves and other goods that they produce in the workshop by hand to sell to customers. They aim to encourage more Kinangop farmers to rear sheep instead of cultivating crops on their land, and so are helping to conserve what remains of the highland grasslands and its unique biodiversity, including of course Sharpe&#39;s Longclaw.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Best,</p><p><br></p><p>David Fox</p><p>&nbsp;</p></body>
