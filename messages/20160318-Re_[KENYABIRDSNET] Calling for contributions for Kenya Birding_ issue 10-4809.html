Hi Catherine,
When was the first Kenya Birding magazine issued? If someone could write something about the Kenya Birding stand at the British bird fair like for example at what year did Kenya had it's first stand at the bird fair. I think Mike Davidson should know all about this.
Happy holidays.

     Dear birders,
It is very exciting that the next issue, the 10th issue, of Kenya Birding has now been confirmed by Nature Kenya. 
Kenya Birding is about birds and birding; sites and places of interest and conservation news.  As usual I’m requesting for comments, articles, or sightings to appear in the magazine:
• Short descriptions of sightings or other natural history observations• Commentaries or news, in which you could draw attention to a conservation concern or a natural history situation (between 50 and 350 words)• Longer articles (between 350 and 700 words) or feature articles of 700-900 words
IMAGES (high resolution .tif or .jpg files)Please avoid sending images by email.Please send a download link via dropbox (or other cloud service) or use the <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://www.wetransfer.com/">https://www.wetransfer.com/</a> to me at this gmail email address or to <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:catherine@brilliantlycrafted.com">catherine@brilliantlycrafted.com</a>
It would greatly help if you could (a) let me know that you are thinking of contributing and (b) submit your contribution by Friday 15 April.
Also, if you have ideas for how we could make this issue even more special please don’t hesitate to drop me a note.
