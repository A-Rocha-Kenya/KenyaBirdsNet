<div class="moz-text-flowed">This is a shocking report, and one that should be followed up as 
quickly as possible by Kenya Wildlife Service.&nbsp; There are strict 
restrictions to all aircraft concerning low flying over national 
parks and reserves.
<br>
<br>If such flights are being operated on a regular basis then its only a 
matter of time before the flamingos will&nbsp; leave the lake.&nbsp; They 
simply cannot tolerate disturbance, particularly by low flying 
aircraft which sends the flocks into a state of panic and result in 
injuries to birds trying to take off en masse.
<br>
<br>It must be hoped that Nature Kenya will take note and request KWS to 
take all appropriate action, just as they have done in the past at 
Lake Nakuru NP.
