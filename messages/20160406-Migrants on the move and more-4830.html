Greetings birders

For once the weather people got it right: they predicted rain starting on
April 1st, and parts of Nairobi received more than 5 cm of rain on the night
of March 31-April 1, with more on the following nights. That brought in a
wave of migratory birds.

Spotted Flycatchers have been scarce all season, but there was one at City
Park on March 30 (just before the rain), many in Nairobi National Park,
Jennifer Oduori found six at the Kenyatta Hospital car park on Monday, and
there were at least 5 at Uhuru Gardens this morning April 6.

There were 7 Lesser Kestels in Nairobi National Park on April 3, Gladys
Kung'u saw more than 5 Eurasian Hobby in Ruiru over the weekend, and there
are reports of Eurasian Nightjar from the Museum grounds and Juja.
Intra-African migrants are also there, with flocks of African Open-billed
Storks over the city.

The most curious sighting this morning is of a resident bird, Klaas's
Cuckoo. A brilliant male Klaas's with food in its beak approached a begging
young Klaas's Cuckoo on a branch and appeared to be feeding it. This
happened three times, then they were driven away by a White-browed Sparrow
Weaver. Now, Klaas's Cuckoos are brood parasites, right? They do not raise
their own young. So why was it feeding a juvenile?

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
