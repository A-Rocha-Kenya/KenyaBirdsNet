<div dir="ltr">Dear all,<br><br>Today we went to Kakuzi Ranch, near Makuyu, for the Nature Kenya Sunday bird watch. At the ranch we recorded Hinde&#39;s Babbler! I don&#39;t know if they were already known to be present at the ranch but it was a pleasant surprise for me. We sighted a flock of 7-10 individuals, though there were others calling in the nearby bushes.Â <br><br>In total we had a bird list of 130 species, including 15 Afro-Palaearctic migrants. Interesting species included Jacobin Cuckoo, juv Brown Snake Eagle, Wahlberg&#39;s Eagle, Sedge Warbler, Black-shouldered Kite, a nesting Red-headed Weaver, White-headed Saw-wing, Wood Sandpiper and Striated Heron among many others. It rained heavily but briefly in the morning and the rest of the day was warm, with termite alates flying all over. This probably contributed to the huge diversity of birds seen.<br><br>Happy birding,<br>Sidney</div>
