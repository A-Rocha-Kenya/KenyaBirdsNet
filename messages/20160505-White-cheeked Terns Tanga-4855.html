<p>he Jahazi of Fish Eagle Point, just north of Tanga is functional agaon so a good opportunity to get some sea legs. Yesterday we were too late on the tide to get to he exposed sandbank off-shore but still saw 30 White-cheeked bobbing on the water about 2 km off-shore. Today the weather was abysmalÂ  get to he off-shore sandbank. This is the first time we did not see any, not a single Lesser Noddy but there were about 1000 White-cheeked Terns in varying stages of acquiring breeding plumage. Also about 300 Lesser Crested Terns, a single Saunders', 2 Sooty Gulls and possibly/probably a Sandwich Tern, much whiter than the Lesser Crested and fishing more like Little/Saunders, just spashing straight down, not the curved swooping movement of the Lesser Crested but much too far away o be certain.</p>
