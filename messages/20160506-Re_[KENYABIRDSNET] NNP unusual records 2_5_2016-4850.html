Dear All,
Every year at exactly this time there is a passage of small to very
large flocks (&gt;2000) over our place, heading S to SW towards the Rift.
The numbers that go over vastly exceed anything that has ever landed
in NNP
Best for now
Brian

Evening Washington,



Thanks for update on NNP on Monday.



I was playing golf at Karen Country Club on Sunday afternoon and about
17.00hrs wave after wave of pelicans flew over. I estimated about 300 but
could have been more. They were in loose formation aka geese and the flight
motion was similar to watching them on sitting on sea waves gently lifting
up and down!



They were heading in a southerly direction and we thought toward Magadi but
it seems some took a rest in the park.



Sorry but club in hand, no camera!



Just an addition - but we are fortunate at the club to have a young Barn Own
and parent seen regularly around the club house and even joining members
close to the upstairs and outside bar!



Happy birding



Alex Duncanson

Hallo all,

Last Monday, Fleur Ng'weno, Ben Allen, Jennifer Oduori and myself spent a
birding day in Nairobi National Park.

The day proved to be very interesting with 157 species recorded.

More interesting were records of: over 20 Great White Pelicans roosting on
Eucalyptus trees at the main gate, a rare black-billed + black-legged Cattle
Egret and Yellow-billed Oxpeckers on a Warthog (while they don't often feed
on small mammals).

See images.



Kind regards.
