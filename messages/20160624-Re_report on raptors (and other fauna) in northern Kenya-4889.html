We have visited Sibiloi and the area you described a number of times over the past 30 years and have also noticed a general downward trend in numbers.</div><div id="yiv2954531780yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1466715573301_6784"><br></div><div dir="ltr" id="yiv2954531780yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1466715573301_6785"><div id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1466715573301_12344">I have attached a few photos you may find of interest from a trip we did to Sibiloi in July 2010. The zebra, Tiang (northern Topi), and Grant's gazelle were all in quite good numbers on the plains around the KWS HQ. The baboons were very shy - near our camp at "campi Turkana" on the lake shore at the southern tip of the park. The cat is a Serval which ran off soon after this photo! The striped and spotted hyena and silver backed jackal we caught on our motion camera in camp.</div><div id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1466715573301_12342"><br></div><div id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1466715573301_12561" dir="ltr">There was a carcass near HQ when we were there with lots of white backed vultures on it. The guys there claimed it had been killed by lions but I'm not sure if this was just a tourist-pleasing idea... I would be surprised if there are still lions there - any thoughts?</div><div id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1466715573301_12815" dir="ltr">We saw fresh lion tracks in the Balessa lugga, just to the north of the Horr valley, a few years ago but that is the furthest north I have seen real evidence of them.<br></div></div><div id="yiv2954531780yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1466715573301_6886" dir="ltr"><br></div><div id="yiv2954531780yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1466715573301_6922" dir="ltr">What an amazing area it is but so fragile and vulnerable. I seem to remember seeing giraffe in the park when I was really young - must be 25 years ago now. When we did a recent field trip to the NE shore of the lake around Ileret the guys there told us that they hunt giraffe and also poachers from Ethiopia are regularly in the area. What hope do these remote areas have for the future??</div><div id="yiv2954531780yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1466715573301_6934" dir="ltr"><br></div><div id="yiv2954531780yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1466715573301_6952" dir="ltr">I will send the photos in a few emails as too big to send all in one.</div><div id="yiv2954531780yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1466715573301_6968" dir="ltr"><br></div><div id="yiv2954531780yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1466715573301_6969" dir="ltr">Regards<br></div><div id="yiv2954531780yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1466715573301_6931" dir="ltr"><br></div><div id="yiv2954531780yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1466715573301_6972" dir="ltr">Kieran<br></div><div id="yiv2954531780yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1466715573301_6868" dir="ltr"><br></div><div id="yiv2954531780yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1466715573301_6881" dir="ltr"><br></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
