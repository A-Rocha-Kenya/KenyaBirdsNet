Greetings birders

On the museum grounds today, Nature Kenya's Wednesday Morning Birdwalk was
treated to a battle over a nest high in a big eucalyptus.

Originally built by Great Sparrowhawks, the nest has already been used by
Lanner Falcons as well as Great Sparrowhawks. Today four species were
claiming the site: Egyptian Geese, Lanner Falcon, Great Sparrowhawk and
Black Kites. The geese actually stood on the nest for a while, but when the
birdwalk ended it was the Great Sparrowhawk that was still in the tree.

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
