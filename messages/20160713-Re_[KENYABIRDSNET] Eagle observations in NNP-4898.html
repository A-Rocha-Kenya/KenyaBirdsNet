Dear Sidney,
Some nice records for the Park area. There was a pair of adult African
Hawk-Eagles that took up a short residence along the Mbagathi not far
from Hippo Pools Oct/Nov last year. It was hoped that they would nest,
but there was never any evidence. I would imagine this could be the
same pair that you saw.
Bateleurs have long had a nest site along the Kisembe River in the
Kisembe Forest. We cannot get there at present because of the road
becoming treacherous since the flooding. These are the only pair in
the Park but they are often along Mbagathi Gorge.
There has long been a pair of Martial Eagles also in the Kisembe
Forest, which is probably responsible for your Galleria sighting,
there canâ€™t be many shopping malls with Martial Eagle on its list! We
frequently see them over the garden here, and they are often in the
afternoons over the Elephant Orphanage area and are undoubtedly the
same pair as Langata Gate and your Galleria bird.
Martial Eagles are not just in Kisembe Forest, but also in forests
such as Aberdares and Mt Kenya. They are in thick forest also such as
Bwindi in Uganda and Nyungwe in Rwanda, and seem quite versatile.
Best for now
Brian

Hi all,

Yesterday I was in Nairobi National Park and had some interesting eagle
sightings:

   1.  Pair of African Hawk-Eagles flying above the Mbagathi gorge close to
   Leopard Cliffs. They were heading southwards into the Kitengela
triangle.
   Anyone know if they are nesting in NNP or somewhere close by?
   2. Single male Bateleur flying close to Impala observation point.
   3. Single adult Martial Eagle circling above the forest very close to
   the park fence at the Magadi rd/Langata rd junction. I actually spotted
it
   from just outside Galleria shopping mall after I had left the park. It
was
   a surprise as I do not expect to see Martial Eagle in a forested area.
It
   was within no more than 50-100 meters of the park fence and I had no
   problem identifying it without binoculars. It circled about 5 times
before
   heading back into the park. Has anyone else seen this species in this
part
   of the park before?

Best regards to all,

Sidney
