<p><span>Hi Birders for my first time to get African Goshawk the melanistic is yesterday 23rd August 2016 at Windsor Golf Hotel and Country Club at the gate on tall trees how I pick it&#39;s call as I was going in to the hotel. I get it on photo though I had to do several shots as the sky was cloudy and it was at 7am where it was as if it will rain.</span></p><p><span>Has it been seen somewhere within Nairobi former province?.</span></p><p><span>Enjoy birding</span></p><p><span>Regards</span></p><p><span>Jonathan Mwachongo&nbsp;</span></p></body>
