Dear All,
After being in Madagascar the past seven weeks, getting back on
Thursday night (29th) it was truly wonderful to be back in a country
of birds. I wasted no time in having a look in the paddock on Friday,
and also yesterday and this morning.
On Friday 30th our first ever Grey-headed Kingfisher and still there
this morning (Sunday), a Willow Warbler, an astounding male Eurasian
Golden Oriole drinking nectar from a
Grevillea robusta, my first ever Sept bird in Kenya. Eurasian
Bee-eaters in good numbers keeping high. Violet-backed Starlings
really numerous even on the ground on all three days, Saturday (1st
Oct)  two Willow Warblers (one singing), lots of Eurasian Bee-eaters
including a flock of over 35 hanging
around, this morning a getting late Mad Pond Heron still in complete
winter dress. It's so good to be back home!
For dragonfly lovers, Pantalas were already back last Friday
presumably from India
this seems really early.
Very best
Brian
