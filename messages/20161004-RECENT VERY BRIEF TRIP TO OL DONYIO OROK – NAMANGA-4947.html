RECENT VERY BRIEF TRIP TO OL DONYIO OROK – NAMANGA.

                14th-16th August 2016

It’s over thirty years since Leon Bennun had an expedition to look at
the avifauna on Ol Donyio Orok (ODO). Fleur Ng’Weno was part of this
investigation. They found some interesting records, but unfortunately
I don’t have a copy of their findings. What I am aware of is that they
trapped an Illadopsis which was released but sadly no photographs
taken. By its distribution it was possibly the only Kenya record of
the eastern form of Pale-breasted Illadopsis now considered a species
apart. It appears that in spite of being an obvious isolated mountain
and next to Namanga, no one had ever since visited the area and
reported the birds that they found.
