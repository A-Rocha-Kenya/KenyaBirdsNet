Dear All,
I am still waiting for someone who may know which this bird is to share. I have been seeing them in Nyeri along the valleys of Chania  and Honi Rivers.
Regards,
Kingori

     Hi Brian  Thanks for this very interestingreport from Ol Doinyo Orok.  The Scopus article from our 1986expedition can be found here - <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/42116318#page/293/mode/1up–">http://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/42116318#page/293/mode/1up–</a> page 83. The two illadopses were in fact photographed and the photos (colourprints) and biometric data are in the NMK Ornithology Department – though Idon’t know how easy they would be to locate now!  As James notes there have been somesurveys recently but still probably lots to find out – hope your reportencourages further work on this forest island.  All the best  Leon    --Leon Bennun

    Hi Brian,

Nice report from Ol Donyo Orok. Certainly an interesting sounding place and who knows what might be in the very high forest. There have been a few trips to this mountain now, and there is a very good NMK report at the link below for those who haven't seen it.

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://www.africanbirdclub.org/sites/default/files/Kenya_Namanga_Hills_2006_0.pdf">https://www.africanbirdclub.org/sites/default/files/Kenya_Namanga_Hills_2006_0.pdf</a>

Best Wishes,

James

     RECENT VERY BRIEF TRIP TO OL DONYIO OROK – NAMANGA.

14th-16th August 2016

It’s over thirty years since Leon Bennun had an expedition to look at
the avifauna on Ol Donyio Orok (ODO). Fleur Ng’Weno was part of this
investigation. They found some interesting records, but unfortunately
I don’t have a copy of their findings. What I am aware of is that they
trapped an Illadopsis which was released but sadly no photographs
taken. By its distribution it was possibly the only Kenya record of
the eastern form of Pale-breasted Illadopsis now considered a species
apart. It appears that in spite of being an obvious isolated mountain
and next to Namanga, no one had ever since visited the area and
reported the birds that they found.</pre></div></body>
