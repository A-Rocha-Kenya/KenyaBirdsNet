Greetings birders

Glad to report that a pair of Golden-tailed Woodpeckers were once again seen
in the Ngong Road Forest at the Racecourse by Nature Kenya's Wednesday
Morning Birdwalk on 12 Oct. The large size, long beak and heavy streaking
below were well seen.

We also saw three bee-eaters: Eurasian, Cinnamon-chested, and Little. A
Willow Warbler made a brief appearance, and we heard that one was ringed at
the Nairobi Museum yesterday.

With best wishes from Fleur
