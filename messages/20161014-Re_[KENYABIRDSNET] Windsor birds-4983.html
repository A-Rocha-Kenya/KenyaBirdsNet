Hi Jonathan,
That's interesting that the breeding activity of Sacred Ibis suddenly
stopped recently. It's the same in NNPark, from dominating Nagalomon
Dam to breeding all over. I had always assumed that the Ibis around
Nairobi bred for much of the year, but maybe they do actually have a
particular season,
Best for now
Brian

The breeding of Sacred ibis has been successful to one of island here, we
use to count hundred of the ibis but now all left and since last week i have
been counting less than ten sacred ibis. To day i saw African Harrier Hawk
in breeding season and at least 10 Eurasian Bee- eaters, Spekes Weavers
males singing and African Golden Weavers making nest where the Sacred Ibis
had nested for the last 5 month.
Great birding
