NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 23rd OCTOBER 2016

Dear All,
Nigel Hunter and I decided on two things, one that we would not bother
wasting our time trying to get entrance at Langata Gate as almost
certainly there would have been no-one there and not to leave the
northern part of the Park today making our southern limit East Gate.

Although we had had no rain, that morning a Eurasian Roller was in the
paddock at home whilst I was waiting for Nigel, and two-days prior we
had had a pair of Common Buzzards both being dark. It gave hope that
there had been an arrival in the Park…. How wrong can you be? Near
anything of note today was on the dams, and Hyena Dam was nothing
short of spectacular.

We started at Ivory Burning Site, there was a Luscinia pinking and
giving the grating churr, but as these calls are shared by Sprosser
and Nightingale we could not put any identity beyond “Sprossergale.”
The first of nine Spotted Flycatchers seen today, and first of three
Willow Warblers completed the migrant presence here apart from a
handsome young Pallid Harrier with very conspicuous neck ring, flying
through low. The highlight here was a pair of Zanzibar Sombre
Greenbuls that have moved in, and with encouragement gave superb
views. There was also an African Goshawk displaying overhead.</pre></div></body>
