Dear All,
I have prepared this list to give some arrival of the migrants back to Kenya.

2016 PALEARCTIC ARRIVALS 30TH SEPT AND ALL OCT FIRST DATES

Black Stork 				9th Oct				NNP	
Common Snipe			5th Oct				NNP
Black-tailed Godwit			5th Oct				NNP
Common Ringed Plover		9th Oct				NNP
White-winged Black Tern		5th Oct				NNP
Pallid Harrier				23rd Oct			NNP
Eurasian Buzzard			21st Oct			Garden Langata
Booted Eagle				23rd Oct			NNP
Eurasian Hobby			30th Oct			Garden Langata
Eurasian Cuckoo			5th Oct				NNP
Common Swift			4th Oct				Garden Langata
Eurasian Bee-eater
Eurasian Roller			9th Oct				NNP
Isabelline Shrike			5th Oct				NNP
Turkestan Shrike			25th Oct			NNP
Eurasian Golden Oriole		30th Sept			Garden Langata
Barn Swallow
Sand Martin				5th Oct				NNP
House Martin				4th Oct				Garden Langata
Willow Warbler
Blackcap				31st Oct			Garden Langata
Garden Warbler			5th Oct				NNP
Common Whitethroat			9th Oct				NNP
Luscinia sp				23rd Oct			NNP
Northern Wheatear			5th Oct				NNP
Isabelline Wheatear			25th Oct			NNP
Whinchat				9th Oct				NNP
Spotted Flycatcher			9th Oct				NNP
Tree Pipit				17th Oct			Garden Langata
Yellow Wagtail			9th Oct				NNP

NOTE: Green, Wood and Common Sandpipers, Common Greenshank, Little
Stint and Ruff are not on this list as they appeared back in July. I
as away until 30th Sept, and there are undoubtedly earlier dates for
Eurasian Bee-eater, Barn Swallow and Willow Warbler before then so I
have left them blank. Black-tailed Godwit and White-winged Black Tern
in the Rift Valley are difficult to determine from over-summering
birds, unless they are proven immatures. The White-winged Black Tern
NNP was such a bird.

It would be interesting if earlier or additional species could be
added to this list to build up a picture of the first returnees in
Kenya. So far the list is all Nairobi, but there must be many more
species arriving now.

Best for now
Brian
