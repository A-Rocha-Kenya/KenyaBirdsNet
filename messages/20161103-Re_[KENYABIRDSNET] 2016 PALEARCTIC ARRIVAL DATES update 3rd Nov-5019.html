      <p>Dear All,<br>
A new migrant first date update is attached.<br>
<br>
News from our paddock. A final species on 1st Nov, of which I am sure<br>
warrants as palearctic migrants at 7.20pm, the Black-winged Stilts<br>
flew over for the first time this passage, last year they were present<br>
from 12th October onwards.<br>
<br>
Nov 2nd was a cold miserable morning, much cloud but still no rain.<br>
Migrants seen were a single Eurasian Hobby flying S quite high, a<br>
heavy passage of Common Swifts all moving E towards NNP, several<br>
parties of Eurasian Bee-eaters but no evidence of movement, two<br>
Eurasian Rollers also going E, a few Barn Swallows mainly S, a single<br>
House Martin NE, up to fifteen Willow Warblers, a female Blackcap and<br>
two Spotted Flycatchers, with the Black-winged Stilts again after<br>
dark.<br>
<br>
Today 3rd Nov, warmer than yesterday but quite a cloudy start and<br>
still no rain. Migrants in the morning were a single Common Swift E, a<br>
few Eurasian Bee-eaters, two Eurasian Golden Orioles heading E, a few<br>
Barn Swallows in all directions, two House Martins NE, a Sand Martin<br>
N, about ten Willow Warblers, the first male Blackcap of the season<br>
and two Garden Warblers, the same two Spotted Flycatchers (present<br>
last five days), two Tree Pipits were the first since the first on<br>
23rd Oct. Also several of what were almost certainly Yellow Wagtails<br>
flying E down the Mbagathi Valley but just too far to be positive.<br>
At 3.30pm three Black Storks came in low over the garden from the W<br>
following the Mbagathi Valley and disappeared into NNP. Shortly<br>
followed by the Bat Hawk who was lesurely flying very low towards<br>
IUCN.<br>
<br>
If you have any August-September dates for Eurasian Bee-eater,<br>
Northern Wheatear and Barn Swallow (the last away from the Rift as<br>
some birds over summer), it would be appreciated.<br>
<br>
Best for now<br>
Brian<br>
