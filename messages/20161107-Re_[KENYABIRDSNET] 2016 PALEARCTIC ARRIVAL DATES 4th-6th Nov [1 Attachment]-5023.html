Thanks James,
The first was a really early bird in NNP 9th Oct, and I have had two
here. The only warblers so far have been Willow, Garden, Blackcap,
Whitethroat and our Olive Tree, so plenty more warblers yet!
Best
for now
Brian

Hi Brian and All, not sure if Greater Whitethroat has been reported yet
this autumn but Simon Carter and I found a single bird in Lower Kabete
today. Also a Red-tailed Shrike showing nice contrast between rufous crown
and pale sandy mantle.

Cheers, James

Dear All,
Continuing the migrant watch report, this morning (4th) was gloomy and
still no rain. It was also cool and birds were not eager to move much.
There was a small passage of Common Swifts but White-rumped are
actually increasing and hanging around old nest sites, a dozen
Eurasian Bee-eaters were in the area, a Eurasian Golden Oriole was
heading south, a House Martin going north, eight or so Willow Warblers
and two Blackcaps (both males). The only other migrant was a Spotted
Flycatcher.
At 9.30am James Bradley came around and we returned to the paddock. He
came at the right time as a Long-legged Buzzard was heading south
directly overhead but apart from unseen calling Yellow Wagtails there
were no other migrant additions.

We then went down to the Icross Road (Elangata Wuas Rd) just a little
way down the Magadi Road and spent the rest of the day in that area.
Migrants were a group of seven Common Buzzards coming in to find a
roosting place, a hepatic Eurasian Cuckoo, a dozen Eurasian Bee-eaters
along the wires, a Red-tailed Shrike sp (only seen in flight so not
identified), a male Red-backed Shrike, a scattering of Barn Swallows
but no major passage, the only migrant warbler seen there was a
stunning Olive Tree that initially stayed in the depths of an Acacia
mellifera, but eventually gave itself up and provided excellent open
views, four Eurasian Rock Thrush, over a dozen Northern and three Pied
Wheatears and four Spotted Flycatchers.

The 5th was quite gloomy and cool when I took my position in the
paddock shortly after 6.00am. It would be true to say that all day
there was not one instance of any positive visual migration and the
following species were probably all birds that arrived previously. The
migrant raptors were just soaring around low over the trees rather
than making a direct passage overhead. In the morning there was a
Black Stork with undercarriage down for a landing into NNP, the
peculiar sight of eight Ruff heading for NNP, a female-plumaged
Montaguâ€™s/Pallid Harrier more likely the former on structure, a few
Common Swifts and Barn Swallows, a few Eurasian Bee-eaters, eight
Willow Warblers, two Blackcaps and a Garden Warbler and the usual two
Spotted Flycatchers plus three Tree Pipits and additionally in the
afternoon two Common Buzzards both pale and one with a very rusty
tail, a pale Booted Eagle, two Eurasian Hobbys and a Eurasian Golden
Oriole.

Another strange sight mid-morning was a heron that arrived from the
west, that dropped from a great height then circled over the garden
flapping all the time, no heron can soar they all have to flap to stay
airborne but can glide with wings bowed downwards when losing
altitude, this is strange because they have such a large wing area.
Storks that are similarly built are able to soar for long periods. The
bird was an immature Purple Heron, possibly this was a palearctic
arrival some should be crossing the sahara. As with most birds it flew
off low towards NNP.

Morning of 6th was clammy chilly and overcast but soon brightened up,
but accompanied with a gusty wind. There was some movement at 6.45am
when parties of Swifts came over quite low. They were in groups of up
to fifty flying completely direct, and whilst in dense rotund clusters
each individual skilfully maintained the same distance from all its
neighbours. There were two species involved, the grating screams
easily identified African Black from all other larger swifts, but the
second species was silent, and were all of the entire flock and were
of the returning Pallid-like birds for this season. They were not much
above eye-level and all uniform buff-grey above. One day the species
will make the Kenya list!
Three Tree Pipits circling, four House Martins heading NW and a single
Barn Swallow heading to NNP were the only moving palearctics apart
from the swifts. Whilst in the bushes were a few Willow Warblers and
the currently resident Spotted Flycatcher.
After returning from breakfast for a short while it was still quite
quiet, a Green Sandpiper flew over towards NNP, a fairly dark Common
Buzzard and a pale Booted Eagle were patrolling the valley, there were
a few more Barn Swallows and just before dusk the days only Eurasian
Hobby.

Best to all
Brian
