<div dir="ltr">Dear all,<br><br>During a brief walk through the Nairobi Arboretum this afternoon to see how the birdlife is doing with the rains, I came across a Narina Trogon! I had been watching an African Goshawk for over 10 mins hunting unsuccessfully along one of the paths. All of a sudden, I noticed some movement in the canopy above me and saw a bird with a very long tail. I thought it was a cuckoo at first, but upon checking with my binoculars I realized it was a Narina Trogon! The sighting was brief as the bird flew off in less than a minute. This was a first for me at the Arboretum, though I think it has probably been seen in the area before.<br><br>Best regards,<br>Sidney</div>
