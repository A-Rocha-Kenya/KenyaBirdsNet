Dear Sidney and Steve,
Thanks for the Lesser Striped Swallow updates, it does seem that they
are back in the area but would be great to hear from others when they
first see them.
Your experience with the Amurs is magical, when at an alate emergence
they dash around madly taking no interest of your presence. Very large
numbers must pass over Nairobi unseen, but early morning they can be
moving quite low, and in the evening when looking for roost sites they
also come within visual distance.
Very best
Brian

Dear Brian,
By Sunday, several Red-rumped Swallows had returned to a regular haunt
along Lower Kabete, near Farasi Lane, while a single bird was among
assorted hirundines feeding over a sports field in Gigiri on Saturday
morning. I saw another on the edge of Karura Forest on Monday.
The thunderstorm that rolled over Nairobi on Saturday evening brought the
most magical birding experience I have had in Kenya: the rain triggered a
tremendous termite hatch around my home, and presumably pushed many a
migrant down toward the ground. First one, then two, then more and more
falcons appeared from the murk, flying around the heads of my family as we
stood mesmerized in the rain in our garden. Amur Falcons, with maybe some
Red-footed among them though it was hard to tell, at least 30 in all. After
a quarter-hour they moved on, but we won't forget them.
Regards,
Steve

Dear Steve, Brian and all,

On Sunday 20th Nov, during a Nature Kenya Sunday bird watch, we saw about
5 Lesser Striped Swallows busy building mud nests under the roof of one
of
the houses at Ziwani Retreat Centre (between Juja and Thika). There was a
high diversity of swallows/martins including Barn, Wire-tailed and
Red-rumped Swallows, Black Saw-wing, Plain Martin and Rock Martin.
Migrants
included Blackcap, Black Stork and Eurasian Swifts. The area was also
interesting as we saw birds of forest, bush and grassland. Brown-backed
and
White-browed Scrub Robin were both seen. Raptors also abounded, including
Lanner Falcon (2 adults and juv), Ayres Hawk-Eagle, Augur Buzzard,
African
Fish Eagle, Black-chested Snake Eagle and Gymnogene.

Regards,
Sidney

Hi Steve,
Thanks so very much for sending this detail on Lesser Striped Swallows
in. On Tuesday I was in NNP all day, in all the favourite haunts for
Lesser Striped, there were none to be seen even though Red-rumped were
gathering mud in puddles.
Yesterday (Wed), one flew over the house calling, staying high and
flying over without any deviation. I concluded this was not one of our
birds. Today our pair were back and singing on their favourite
perches.
It would be really good if people could write in when they see their
first, as I suspect in the next couple of days they could be
everywhere, which would suggest a mass movement back to Nairobi.
Without this information, the migration of the species back into
Nairobi will continue to remain a mystery.

Best for now
Brian

Hello Brian,
You were asking for sightings of lesser-striped swallows returning to
Nairobi. I saw several feeding at the dam on the Kofinaf coffee estate,
off
Ngenda Road, north of Kiambu, on Sunday Nov. 20. Still, none have
returned
yet to where I have often seen them off Lower Kabete in Nairobi.
Regards,
Steve Graham
