Hi Jez,
I saw your image, and immediately had reservations.
I thought the overall shape and the bill slightly too short for
Common, the black nape
looked too small and neat, the legs were retaining bright red and
should be darker red now, the upperparts were very uniform and paler
grey than I would expect on a Common, the carpal bar was small and not
as prominent as a winter plumage Common should show, this could be
some vestige of breeding plumage still retained, and the bird is more
squat than a Common which usually appears attenuated.
In the second image the tail shows a straight-edged gentle fork,
whereas in Common there should be some outer-tail projection and an
overall deeper fork. The outer primaries are grey and blackish in
Common giving more contrast on the closed wing.
To date there has never been a Common Tern convincingly recorded in
the Nairobi region, but such a nice image,
Very best
Brian



Very best
