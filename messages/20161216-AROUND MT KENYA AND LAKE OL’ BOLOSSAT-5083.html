">Dominic Kimani, Samuel Bakari and I had the run of Marania
Farm near Timau on 5 December 2016 with the kind permission of the Murray
family, who own the farm, and by prior arrangement with Jamie Murray, who generally
manages it. It is a mixed farm that lies at an altitude of some 2,400 m and covers
2,600 ha. Half of it is for arable crops, the other half is for grazing sheep and cattle. The farm’s native grasslands and wheat fields also provide
territories for a significant population of Sharpe’s Longclaw, whose numbers
and movements Dominic and his field assistant, John Kamau, have been monitoring.
We flushed several of these Endangered endemics and inspected four of their active
nests that John had previously located. Other birds that we recorded on our
walk around the farm included Common Quail, Black-headed Heron, Rufous-naped
Lark, Hunter’s, Levaillant’s and Wing-snapping Cisticolas, Plain Martin,
African Stonechat, Jackson’s Widowbird, Grassland Pipit, and Yellow-crowned
Canary. We also saw a good selection of raptors – African Harrier-Hawk, Martial,
Steppe and Lesser Spotted Eagles, Pallid Harrier, Augur and Mountain Buzzards,
and Eurasian Hobby. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;

">The following day, 6 December 2016, Bakari, Dominic and I
visited Ngare Ndare Forest. The dominant trees in this largely intact, indigenous
forest are Red Cedar and African Olive, some of which are hundreds of years
old. From our vantage points on the canopy walkway in the middle of the forest,
and the elevated platform at the end of it, we saw quite a number of Hartlaub’s
Turaco (some were bathing in a stream) and small groups of noisy Red-fronted
Parrot. Other birds seen here included Grey and Black Cuckooshrikes, Northern
Puffback, Grey Apalis, Black Saw-wing, Eurasian Blackcap, Northern
Double-collared Sunbird, Grey and Mountain Wagtails, and Tree Pipit. Later we
walked along a track to a waterfall and among the birds seen on the way were Dusky
Turtle Dove, Great Sparrowhawk, Narina Trogon (which was common), Violet Wood
Hoopoe, Cinnamon-chested Bee-eater, Yellow-rumped Tinkerbird, Lesser Honeyguide,
Brown-backed Woodpecker, Black-headed Oriole, Brown-crowned Tchagra, White-bellied
Tit, Black Saw-wing, Garden Warbler, Brown Parisoma, Little Rock Thrush, and
African Yellow White-eye. The Trust that maintains the forest, under KFS’s
supervision, charged us 2,000 Ksh each for entrance. These fees also paid for a
local guide and ranger who accompanied us. The road to the forest, off the main
Nanyuki-Embu road, traverses the Murrays’ Lolomarik Farm, where we saw a pair
of Secretarybirds and a flock of Black-winged Plovers.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;

">On 7 December 2016 Dominic, Bakari and I drove from the Naro
Moru Park Gate to the Meteorological Station, walked up the path to the edge of
the moorland and retraced our steps. Near the Met Station we saw Abysinnian
Ground Thrush and heard an owl, calling from inside a dense stand of bamboo,
that we failed to locate. Higher up, in the Hagenia forest and Hypericum scrub,
we saw Scaly Francolin, Eastern Bronze-naped Pigeon, Mountain Yellow and
Cinnamon Bracken Warblers, Chestnut-throated Apalis, Mountain Greenbul, Brown
Woodland Warbler, Kikuyu White-eye, African Dusky Flycatcher, White-starred
Robin, Eastern Double-collared and Tacazze Sunbirds, Thick-billed and Streaky Seedeaters,
and Kandt’s Waxbill. On the moorland we saw, appropriately, Moorland Chat,
while overhead were resident Augur Buzzard and migrant Eleonora’s Falcon.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;

">We went to Lake Ol’ Bolossat with George Muigai on 8
December 2016 to see the single largest population of Grey Crowned Crane in Kenya,
which George is monitoring. We saw around 100 of these Endangered birds by the lake,
and around 300 more were feeding in nearby stubble fields and grasslands. Water
birds on or at the edges of the lake that we recorded were Egyptian Goose, Southern
Pochard, Garganey, Hottentot Teal, Northern Shoveler (which was the most
numerous duck), Eurasian Wigeon, Yellow-billed Duck, Red-billed Teal, Northern
Pintail, Yellow-billed Stork, Glossy and African Sacred Ibis, African
Spoonbill, Squacco Heron, Yellow-billed Egret, Grey, Black-headed and Goliath
Herons, Red-knobbed Coot (which were abundant), Black-winged Stilt, Common Ringed
Plover, Long-toed and Blacksmith Lapwings, Kittlitz’s Plover, African Jacana, Ruff,
and Common, Green, Marsh and Wood Sandpipers. We also saw African Marsh Harrier,
Angola Swallow and Red-throated Pipit. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;

">On 9 December 2016 Bakari and I birded a stretch of Meru
(Upper Imenti) Forest, which we accessed via a track off the main Nanyuki-Meru road.
Here we came upon a mixed-species flock that included a pair of Green Malkoha
(Eastern Yellowbill). Other birds in this party were White-eared Barbet,
Fine-banded and Bearded Woodpeckers, Purple-throated Cuckooshrike,
Black-fronted Bushshrike, Black-headed Apalis, Collared Sunbird, and
Brown-capped Weaver. Apart from the bird party we saw Tambourine Dove,
Hartlaub’s Turaco, Black Stork, Lizard Buzzard, Crowned and Silvery-cheeked
Hornbills, Mountain Oriole, Slender-billed, Yellow-whiskered and Placid
Greenbuls, Willow Warbler, what looked more like African Yellow than Kikuyu
White-eyes, Ruppell’s Robin-Chat, and Kenrick’s Starling. At the nearby Nkunga
Sacred Lake, we saw Pied Kingfisher, Green-backed Honeybird, Sedge Warbler, Eastern
Golden and Vitelline Masked Weavers. We also heard African Emerald and
Red-chested Cuckoos. We were accompanied throughout by two armed KFS rangers,
whom we picked up at Meru Forest Station. The Forester charged 1,000 Ksh each
for them, 600 Ksh for me and 400 Ksh for Bakari.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;

">Bakari, Dominic and I were staying at Colobus Cottages <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://colobuscottages.com/">http://colobuscottages.com/</a> near Naro
Moru. Birding on the property and along the road to it, we
saw an interesting mix of species. These included &nbsp;Klaas’s Cuckoo, Sombre Nightjar, Black-chested
Snake, Crowned and African Fish Eagles, Blue-naped and Speckled Mousebirds,
Common Scimitarbill, Red-throated Wryneck, Orange-breasted Bushshrike, Slate-coloured
and Tropical Boubous, Red-backed Shrike, Yellow-breasted and Chestnut-throated
Apalis, Rattling Cisticola, Rufous Chatterer, Violet-backed, Hildebrandt’s,
Greater Blue-eared and Superb Starlings, Pale Flycatcher, Northern
Double-collared, Green-headed, Scarlet-chested, Amethyst, Bronze and Variable
Sunbirds, Red-collared Widowbird, and Golden-breasted Bunting.</span></p><p>

">A stopover for a walk at the Ndaragwa Nature Trail on 3
December 2016 produced Slender-billed and Sharpe’s Starlings. And driving along
the road crossing the Solio Plains the same day and on 8 December 2016, we saw Yellow-necked
Spurfowl, Black-bellied Bustard, a flock of around 20 Grey Crowned Crane (do
they breed in the Solio Game Reserve?), Crowned Lapwing, Black-winged Kite, Tawny
Eagle, Montagu’s Harrier, Red-capped Lark, Pectoral-patch Cisticola, Banded
Martin, Barn Swallow, Whinchat, Northern Anteater Chat, Northern, Capped and
Isabelline Wheatears, Western Yellow Wagtail, and Plain-backed Pipit.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
