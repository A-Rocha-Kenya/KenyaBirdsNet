Dear All,
At the beginning of December last year, Jez Simms sent in an image of
two terns on the Hopcraft Game Ranch.
There was a suggestion that one was a Common Tern, and I wrote in to
say why it wasnâ€™t a Common Tern, then ended with I thought it an adult
White-winged Black Tern.
Since then David Fisher has written to me suggesting that a
White-winged Black Tern would look much smaller against an adult
Whiskered Tern and this is indeed true. The bird is as he says an
adult winter-plumaged Whiskered and not a White-winged Black as I had
stated. Apologies to Jez!
Best to all
Brian
