The  day before  yesterday Roger Smith, Francis Cherutich, Ben Mugambi
and I had a total of 10 Red-necked Phalaropes at Lake Bogoria.

I was not expecting phalaropes at that location.  When I spotted one
while scanning a flock of shorebirds, at first my brain refused to
accept it.  But the black eye spot, pale plumage except semi-streaked
dark gray mantle, etc. made me realize it was indeed a Red-necked
Phalarope!

We had a total of 10 phalaropes scattered around among the usual
shorebirds - which were all quite skittish and did not allow for close
approaches (outside  the  vehicle).   The level of harassment by local
children is abundantly obvious - a few were looking for trouble while
we were there.  Between that and the goats, dogs,  etc. roaming the
place, it looks to be a sad state of affairs at  Bogoria today.

On the way back to Tumbili Cliff Lodge, Francis spotted  a Bat Hawk
chasing bats near the southern end of the Baringo cliffs.  We then
lost  it in the dimming light when it went below the cliffs.  Then a
couple of minutes  later  Roger spotted it again and we enjoyed decent
looks for 8-9 seconds.

I imagine that might be a fairly reliable spot for Bat Hawks in the future.

I attached a documentary photo of a Red-necked Phalarope - not the
best quality but the distance was great and the light was harsh.

Good birding,

Nathan Dias
