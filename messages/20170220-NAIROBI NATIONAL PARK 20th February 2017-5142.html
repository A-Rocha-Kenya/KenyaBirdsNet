NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 20th February 2017

Dear All,
With the changeover to “cashless KWS.” Anticipating problems at the
entrance with everyone being able to purchase their entrances to the
National Parks on that one visit only with Visa Card or Mpesa, a melee
was envisioned. So Nigel Hunter and a visiting friend Isabel from UK
picked me up at 6.05am and we were at the Gate by shortly after
6.15am. There were four staff at the check-in and I must say that were
all handling the whole system very proficiently, we had a visitor at
full rates paid by her Visa, Nigel at residents paid by Visa and I
still had money on my Smart Card and we were inside the Park heading
for Ivory Burning Site before 6.30am. It would seem that MPesa might
be a tardy system but Visa works very well.

There had been a few light showers in the past few days, and it was a
fairly gloomy start and in fact even though bright from mid-morning
there were still odd showers up to late afternoon yet at home so
close, no rain had fallen.

The first bird of the day (literally) was a Common Buzzard along the
main road, and on turning off for IBS, Zanzibar Greenbuls were calling
cheerfully. The bushes were quiet and whilst we did not hear any
Nightingales here we did have four birds during the day including two
singing and so presumably having completed their moult. There was an
Olivaceous Warbler in the Acacia gerardii but the only migrant there.
On the Ivory Burning Arena there was an Isabelline Wheatear.

On the Nagalomon Drift, the sight was extraordinary the road being
full of vehicles, as instead of Spotted Thick-knees there were four
lions draped over the rocks. This was an impressive start to the day
for visitors who were still arriving straight from the entrance. On
the dam, a pod of eighteen Hippos were also drawing a crowd. It was
quite quiet as far as birds were concerned, no Darters which after the
appearance of intended breeding again ten days ago were now replaced
by a good number of Long-tailed Cormorants. There were single African
Spoonbills, Great Egret and Purple Heron, eight White-faced Whistling
Ducks, and the immature Fish Eagle but a marked absence of waders.

Taking the back way to Hyena Dam, there were three nice Scaly
Francolins feeding on the road but again little else apart from a
Red-faced Cisticola along the Hyena Dam feeding stream, breeding
plumaged Red-billed Queleas as was one out of a number of White-winged
Widowbirds. The dam itself though had risen and flooded some of the
areas that had dried up. Pride of place went to two Black-tailed
Godwits, which although there was one late last year for some six
weeks, still only account for the third record for the Park. Other
species were single Great and Yellow-billed Egrets, African Spoonbill
and three Glossy Ibis, six Red-billed and two Hottentot Teal, a pair
of adult Fish Eagles, a pair of Grey Crowned Cranes, three adult
African Jacanas, eighteen Black-winged Stilt, a couple of pairs of
Spur-winged Plover, ten Long-toed Plovers including the white-winged
southerner, (the usual Blacksmith, Crowned and Three-banded Plovers of
course), two Little Stint, three Ruff, a Common Snipe, a couple of
Green, twenty-plus Wood and three Common Sandpipers, and the only
three Whinchats seen all day. Another highlight here though was a
fairly large Crocodile that came up next to the car showing his prize
catfish breakfast (see image).

We drove down by the Mokoyeti River where a Saddle-billed Stork flew
by, then circled back to Nagalomon and around the Kingfisher Picnic
Site finding no interesting birds on the way and a series of showers.
At Kingfisher apart from Red-throated Tits and the normal birds
including jacksoni Red-faced Crombecs, was an adult Black Stork and
calling White-bellied Bustards (also heard at Eland Hollow).

In the small creek, along the southern road was a small Crocodile
basking on the rock. I don’t think I have ever seen a Croc away from
the main dams and Mbagathi before. Along the inside road near Maasai
Gate there were a male Pied, two Isabelline and three Northern
Wheatears including a singing and whitest male I have ever seen, (see
Image). Back on the main road there was an almost blackish Steppe
Eagle with a prominent pale spot on the centre of the back, initially
taken for a Lesser Spotted but the longish seventh primary ruled that
out (see image). On the Mokoyeti crossing below the Baboon Cliffs the
Pallid Honeyguide is still present and incredibly vociferous. On the
other side of Baboon Cliffs we had an immature eagle first taken as a
Crowned because of the exaggerated crest, but see the description for
the Montage accompanying the images as to why it is a Martial. Also
the first of two Tawny Eagles was here.

Because we were so early we had time to have a walk at Hippo Pools,
something we never have the time to do nowadays and always give it a
miss. We picked up a number of species including a party of Eurasian
Bee-eaters and another Olivaceous Warbler and two Willow Warblers. The
best bird here though was a White-backed Night-Heron roosting in
bushes over the water just before the long metal bridge, whilst in the
same place as birds have been found for years (though none in the past
three), it appears to be sub-adult and so must be different and
probably from a local nest, (see image). A spectacular sight was the
sudden appearance of five-hundred Marabous, and later, numbers all
along the Mbagathi totalling over a thousand birds. Also along here
some Helmeted Guineafowl were giving raucous alarms, and a raptor
dashed up from the bushes and sat in a tree allowing it to be studied
from the back but the front was never seen. The identification of this
individual is not so easy, between African and Ayre’s Hawk Eagles, but
at the time we settled for African, (see image).

The Mbagathi is dammed again and ceases to flow freely. The water
level has now dropped below the narrow channel that was excavated to
release the water, and is finding it difficult to flow up-hill! The
whole area looks like a tip and has been very badly handled although
much of the pipe has been covered. Worse still with the Park
completely open and only a dry ditch to cross with no river barring
the way, large numbers of children were minding cows and sheep grazing
in the Park. Recently Lions have killed a few Cows in this area of the
Park, and the children all ran off when we appeared and hid on the
other side of the river. They were obviously very nervous at leaving
their animals unguarded, and so we stayed around just to let them
panic longer, but eventually they sneaked back from further up the
river and re-joined their flocks.
Birdwise there was little on offer, but our days only Spotted
Flycatcher was here.

Lunch was on the Athi Dam wall, the loringi Red-faced Crombecs were
singing from the same flowering Acacia mellifera (mass flowering
through the southern portion of the Park), as ten days ago. The same
Olivaceous Warbler is still also there on its territory now shared
with Willow Warblers and a couple of Yellow-bellied Eremomelas.

The dam was disappointing for waders, we found two adult Pink-backed
Pelicans, the days only Darter, a roosting Black-crowned Night-Heron,
ten White, an immature Black and nine Yellow-billed Storks most of
which were in breeding plumage and pink, a Glossy Ibis, a couple of
Black-winged Stilts, Spur-winged Plovers but just one Kittlitz’s, six
Little Stints, the only two Greenshank for the day, and a few Speckled
Pigeons in the weeds.

The grasslands were very quiet but did produce the first of three
Black-shouldered Kites, two Kori Bustards, a Rosy-breasted Longclaw
and a few Banded Martins amongst a scattering of Barn Swallows.
Karen Primary School Dam held no rewards and still no Sedge Warblers
have appeared in the Park this season, so we continued to Eland Hollow
which was losing water rapidly. There was another Northern Wheatear en
route, and scanning the swamp there was not much obvious, a pair of
Grey Crowned Cranes, one Red-billed Teal, a Jacana and a few Wood
Sands, but soon a glowing adult male Black-headed Yellow Wagtail (race
feldegg) was found, and a first for me in the Park and I believe a
first ever record for this beautiful bird here, (see image). Three
normal lutea Yellow Wagtails were also present and nearby was a
Red-throated Pipit. Whilst watching this bird a Blacksmith Plover
suddenly appeared chasing a Spotted Redshank. There has only ever been
one record of this species in the Park before, and that by a reliable
visiting birder last century. Although quite normal in the Rift, it is
extraordinary how it misses us. It landed down the far end, (see
Image). So a completely new species for me in the Park, after such a
long time. Eland Hollow might be a Purple Patch and worth visiting.

We skirted past Hyena and Nagalomon Dams with nothing additional, the
Forest Edge Dam held on to its Yellow-billed Egret (which really is a
remarkable piece of site fidelity), and whilst water levels have
dropped dramatically, the last Little Grebe was here, it is an
immature bird but will hopefully be able to fly by the time the water
level drops too low. Further along the road towards Langata Dam was
the days only migrant shrike, a female Isabelline and at the dam a
very beautiful and confiding female Saddle-billed Stork being the days
last bird before we exited Langata Gate.

So it was a full day for our visitor Isabel, whom we found rather late
in the day had never been birding before! Mammals though were
exceptional, we had ten Antelope species, enough Lions (Trish Heather
Hayes had seen 13 today on her rounds, and watched the big Croc at
Athi Dam successfully take a Zebra). Strangely today whilst there were
plenty of Zebra in the Park, there has been a reversal and Wildebeest
actually outnumbered them. There was a good thousand present and very
widespread. A good list of more normal mammal species were met with,
and there were large numbers of people visiting the Park today and
they were very happy indeed with what they were seeing.

As far as birding goes, it is up there as one of the most interesting
days I have had in NNP, and yet for bush, scrub and grassland birds it
has also got to one of the dullest! Never two days the same in Nairobi
National Park.

Best to all
Brian

KEY TO THE MONTAGE

TOP LEFT
SADDLE-BILLED STORK FEMALE
Sexes readily identified by eye-colour, males being blackish.

TOP MIDDLE
BLACK-TAILED GODWITS
The two that are in exactly the same place at Hyena Dam, as the single
bird last year.

TOP RIGHT AND DIRECTLY BELOW
BLACK-HEADED YELLOW WAGTAIL (feldegg) ADULT MALE
The first for NNP, it is the only race of Yellow Wagtail which has
been mooted as a possible separate species. The call is different
being shrill not soft. On my video I took, it did call once. This
birds usual wintering area is Lake Victoria and Kyoga Lake in Uganda.
It’s rare but regular in the Rift, but they do not normally occur East
of it.

SECOND ROW FAR LEFT
SPOTTED REDSHANK
The bird at Eland Hollow, only the second time in the Park and the
first I have ever seen here. This is also a mainly Rift Valley bird.

SECOND ROW, SECOND FROM LEFT
WHITE-BACKED NIGHT-HERON
Although roosting in bushes at Hippo Pools used in the past, this bird
does appear to be sub-adult and not the bird there last, but not
recorded in the past three years it would seem. It should become a
fixture and for a WBNH is quite open and with the droves of people
that walk past it (especially on weekends), not nervous of humans.

SECOND ROW, SECOND FROM RIGHT
NORTHERN WHEATEAR
This is certainly the whitest Northern Wheatear I think I have ever
seen. There was a faint primrose wash to the throat, but otherwise
underparts pure white. The back was extremely pale grey. I was
contentedly singing to itself.

FAR RIGHT, THIRD ROW
MARTIAL EAGLE IMMATURE
It’s remarkable how such very differently plumaged, and unrelated
adult Crowned and Martial Eagles have such similar immature plumages.
This bird in the riverine forest along the Mbagathi was initially
taken as a young Crowned because of the long and upright crest
feathers. However there are three features on this image that confirm
it as a Martial. The eye is very dark, pale to grey in Crowned, the
long wings almost reach the bottom of the tail, the short wings of
Crowned extend little along the length of the tail and the tight
feathering around the legs are all white but have blackish markings in
Crowned.

BOTTOM LEFT
A VERY HAPPY CROCODILE AT HYENA DAM
…and maybe a not so happy Catfish!

BOTTOM ROW, SECOND FROM LEFT
AFRICAN HAWK EAGLES SUB-ADULT(?)
Unfortunately this is the only view we had of this bird after it flew
up to a perch after an unsuccessful raid on a group of unseen
Guineafowl. The only feature seen that does not appear in this image,
is that when the head turned the throat was much paler than it appears
here. I had not really considered that there was a plumage where
Ayre’s and African Hawk-Eagles could be confused but this one is just
that.
It’s not fully adult, the upperparts are blotchy black but no pale
scaling of young birds, but whilst its body plumage is moving to
adulthood the tail remains immature with fine banding along the length
including the terminal, adult tails of both species have a much more
prominent wide terminal band and in African the adult tail base colour
is pale grey not brown. This tail is that of a sub-adult and matches
both species. The leg and thigh feathering is already white and
appears there are no black markings. Usually Ayre’s are depicted with
black thigh spots, and African unmarked but around Nairobi at least,
we know some Ayre’s have all white leggings. The wing/tail ratios,
juvenile eye and cere colours (and adults) are the same in both
species, and the grey panels on the wings of African are not present
as the wing-feathering is not yet fully adult. There is white showing
on what can be seen from the wings which are held forward showing some
of the white carpal, but this does not appear to extend to the
upperwing to form the headlights of Ayre’s. The bird looks slender,
whilst Ayre’s have more bulk but that is about all there is to go on.
Wouldn’t birding be boring if it were all straightforward?!

BOTTOM ROW FARTHEST TWO RIGHT IMAGES
STEPPE EAGLE
This is the third species of problem raptor encountered today. The sky
at this juncture was quite leaden, the left hand image is against a
whitish background because I lightened it to see if there was anything
on the underwing.
When first seen, this eagle appeared nearly all black, not
particularly large and with a conspicuous pale spot on the middle of
the back.
Because of its size it was initially taken for a Lesser Spotted, but
the images show a long 7th primary which in Spotted Eagle species is
extremely short. With the image enhanced you can actually see a very
long gape line. So it would appear a sub-adult orientalis.
