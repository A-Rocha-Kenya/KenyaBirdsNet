<div>Dear Brian;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for your reply.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>i). In the recent paper in Scopus&nbsp; I asked the question
&quot;<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000"><b> Are<i>
Phoeniculus purpureus niloticus</i> (Neumann 1903) and<i> Phoeniculus
damararensis granti</i> (Neumann 1903) conspecific ?</b></font></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>ii). Certainly I feel that all evidence (including the specimen
evidence) suggests that they are.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>iii). If one looks at the specimen evidence of which there are a
considerable number in most major museum collections:</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>a). Jackson had marwitzi from Kijabe, Rumuriti and Nyando
Valley.</div>
<div>b)&nbsp; Jackson had granti&nbsp; from Taveta, KIbwezi and
Ngomeni (Taita Dist).</div>
<div>c)&nbsp; Jackson had niloticus from Turkwel and Baringo.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>d) Van Someren had marwitzi from Kisumu, Nairobi, Simba, Mombasa,
Hola (Tana River), Sokoke and Rabai</div>
<div>e) Van Someren had granti from Mariakani, Kutui, Simba and
Archer's Post.</div>
<div>f) Van Someren had niloticus from Lodwar, Turkana and
Turkwell.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>g).&nbsp; All of Ligon's birds from Naivasha and Elmenteita were
marwitzi.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>h). In Tring there are a few specimens of granti collected by
M-Praed from the Tsavo River.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>i) Los Angeles County Museum have from the Cheney Expedition
specimens of :</div>
<div>marwitzi from Boni Forest, Witu, Bura (Tana),&nbsp; Naivasha and
Turkwell.</div>
<div>granti from Boni Forest,&nbsp; Bura (Tana River) and
Maralal.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>j). Carnegie Museum have specimens of</div>
<div>marwitzi from Mombasa.</div>
<div>granti&nbsp; from Garissa, Embu (Upper Tana River), Lali
Hills.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>k). Smithsonian have specimens from the Childs Frick Exped
of:</div>
<div>marwitzi from Northern Uaso Nyiro&nbsp; but with a comment from
Friedmann wondering &quot;if they may not be hybrids between marwitzi
and granti&quot;</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Much of this confirms the utter confusion and uncertainty
relating to museum specimens which is what I and others at Tring found
when one day I laid them all out and we looked at them closely under
natural sunlight, artificial light, in bright sunlight and under
cloudy conditions. The conclusion at the time was that the specimen
evidence of all three forms was inconclusive when assigning any to a
particular subspecies.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Also you will also note several cases where both marwitzi and
granti are found to have been collected from the same localities,
again clearly showing the difficulty collectors had when examining
birds in the hand.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Finally to be perfectly frank I would say it is impossible to
racially determine any birds on photographic evidence no matter where
from.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>iv). The Scopus paper did not address birds known as the
Black-billed Wood-hoopoe other than a comment that&nbsp; &quot;<font
face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">The Black-billed Wood-Hoopoe<i>
Phoeniculus somaliensis</i>, long considered a race of the Green
Wood-hoopoe, was deemed worthy of separate species status by Davidson
(1976) on the grounds that the largely all-black bill is typically
more slender and decurved than in either<i> purpureus</i> or<i>
damarensis</i>, and indeed that longer bill does serve to distinguish
it from the other two (Turner 2014). Meanwhile its status in northern
Kenya border areas vis-à-vis any sympatry with either<i>
niloticus</i> o<i>r granti</i> remains unclear&quot;.</font></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I hope this helps to clarify the matter.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>With best wishes</div>
<div>Don</div>
