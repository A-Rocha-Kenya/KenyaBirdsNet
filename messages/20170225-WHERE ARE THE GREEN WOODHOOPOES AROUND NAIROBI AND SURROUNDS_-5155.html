Dear All,
I have misintrepreted the context of Don Turner's Scopus article,
which is a very thorough piece of research and well worth reading.
He has written to say that he does not say that the three species
should be considered as one species.
Thanks to Jez's response and he promises to get on with capturing his
Wood-hoopoes at the Hopcroft Ranch, on camera,
Best for now
Brian
