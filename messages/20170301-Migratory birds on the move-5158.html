Greetings Birders

Nature Kenya's Wednesday Morning Birdwalk at Paradise Lost this morning was
particularly rewarding.

Migratory birds seem to be on the move. A Booted Eagle flew low over our
group. Other migrants included Western Marsh Harrier, Green and Common
Sandpiper, Willow Warbler, Blackcap, Nightingale, Tree Pipit, Yellow Wagtail
and White Wagtail!

Local birds were also varied, with a sub-adult Ayres's Hawk Eagle at close
range being so confusing that we debated its ID for 15 minutes until it
dived into the forest in characteristic forest eagle fashion.

A total of about 80 species were seen or heard, including Grey-olive
Greenbul and Beautiful Sunbird. The Cinnamon-chested Bee-eaters were feeding
fledglings, and seem to be using drain pipes along the road as nesting
holes.

Thanks to Paradise Lost for their hospitality as always.

Good birding, Fleur
