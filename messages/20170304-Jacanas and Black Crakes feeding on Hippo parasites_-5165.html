Has anyone ever seen African Jacanas or Black Crakes eating
ectoparasites on Hippos?   Is this unusual behavior - or not really?
I ask because I think I may have documented this, yet have never heard
of such behavior.

Background:
Not long ago I bought lunch at Little Governor's Camp in the Mara
Triangle to gain access for some forest birding (had a nice encounter
with a pair of Schalow's Turacos among other goodies).

The wetland behind the dining area was pretty low and a few Hippos
were semi-submerged in the mud and shallow water.  A couple of the
Hippos were being used as roosting islands by waterbirds.

One Hippo also apparently provided a foraging platform.  As the
following images show, the Black Crake and African Jacana seem to be
repeatedly pecking at things on the Hippo's skin.  I do not think it
was flies, odonates, etc; I think it was something on the Hippo -
ticks seem most likely.

See the attached image file for what seems like waterbirds acting like
Oxpeckers.

This photo is larger, so I will send the web link and not email it as
an attachment:

Feedback appreciated.

Good birding,
