      <p>Has anyone ever seen African Jacanas or Black Crakes eating<br>
ectoparasites on Hippos?   Is this unusual behavior - or not really?<br>
I ask because I think I may have documented this, yet have never heard<br>
of such behavior.<br>
<br>
Background:<br>
Not long ago I bought lunch at Little Governor&#39;s Camp in the Mara<br>
Triangle to gain access for some forest birding (had a nice encounter<br>
with a pair of Schalow&#39;s Turacos among other goodies).<br>
<br>
The wetland behind the dining area was pretty low and a few Hippos<br>
were semi-submerged in the mud and shallow water.  A couple of the<br>
Hippos were being used as roosting islands by waterbirds.<br>
<br>
One Hippo also apparently provided a foraging platform.  As the<br>
following images show, the Black Crake and African Jacana seem to be<br>
repeatedly pecking at things on the Hippo&#39;s skin.  I do not think it<br>
was flies, odonates, etc; I think it was something on the Hippo -<br>
ticks seem most likely.<br>
<br>
See the attached image file for what seems like waterbirds acting like<br>
Oxpeckers.<br>
<br>
This photo is larger, so I will send the web link and not email it as<br>
an attachment:<br>

Feedback appreciated.<br>
<br>
Good birding,<br>
