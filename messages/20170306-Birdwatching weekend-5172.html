<p><span>Dear birders on Sunday the 5th March, I and David Guarnieri went out to bird watching at Windsor, we meet at hotel reception at 6.36am. Then we walk from Club house to end of golf course, as we carry on birds were very active at the Lake view Cormorants both Reed and Great cormorants flock of more 20 Sacred Ibis, Yellow- billed Stork, African spoonbill, Black crown Night Heron, Little Grebe, and more than 8 African Golden Weaver on the island Nesting.</span></p><p><span>At the bush we saw a tailless male bronze Sunbird singing Cisticola. Grey capped warbler, Malachite king fisher and Streak seed eater. As we were walking we had five tree Pipits foraging on the ground then flashed to the tree. Far at the end of Golf course at around the wetland we had African Pygmy Kinfisher, white winged Widowbird, Red-check Cordon Blue, Black Capped and Black- and -white Mannikin building nest, Montain Wagtail, Two Tambourine Dove,here we turned round back to club house on other side of golf course. On our way I mentioned to David a spot where we saw Green back Twinspot with the group from Nature Kenya Lead by Fleur. As I made the three steps forward I saw three Green backed Twinspot on the ground feeding, then flashed up on a dead log I tried to get it camera but the features are not clear though we had two females and a male this is at number 11.</span></p><p>Our walk end at 10.30 with a total of 84 species and 2 in identifying species.</p><p>This was one of the intensive birding I have had while here.</p><p>Regards&nbsp;</p><p>Jonathan&nbsp;</p><p>Enjoy birding&nbsp;</p></body>
