<div dir="ltr"><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div>Hi All,<br><br></div>I am currently based at Angama Mara which is located on the Oloololo Escarpment above the Mara Triangle, not far south of Mara West Camp and the Sabaringo Valley, for 2 months from 5th March. The facility is split into two camps, &#39;North&#39; and &#39;South&#39; and I&#39;ll use these occasionally to offer a better idea of where to look for birds for the benefit of any future visitors. As I am based in the North Camp, all reports refer to this unless South Camp or in the Mara Triangle (MT) is stated. <br><br></div><div>Common/ frequently seenn residents in the camp include Red-fronted Tinkerbird, Spot-flanked and <i>albicauda</i> White-headed Barbets, Red-winged Starling, Chinspot Batis, Brown-throated Wattle-eye.<br></div><div><br>Here are some records from the past few days;<br><br></div>5th March (PM)<br></div><div>At camp fire-pit (overlooking escarpment); Greater and Lesser Honeyguides both heard in the savanna below (MT). 1 ad Martial Eagle<br></div><div>Wooded valley on the south edge of facility; 1 Thick-billed Honeyguide (seen and heard), 1 Grey Cuckoo-shrike, 2 Black Cuckoo-shrikes.<br></div><div><br></div>6th March<br></div><div>At camp fire-pit (AM), a pair of Pallid Honeyguides in the Rock Figs, at eye-level.<br></div><div>Around escarpment; 1 Steppe Buzzard, 1 Verreaux&#39;s Eagle, 2 African Harrier-hawk.<br></div><div><br></div>7th March<br></div>At &#39;Out of Africa&#39; kopje (adjacent to South Camp), a Red-throated Wryneck and several Rock-loving Cisticola were heard.<br></div><div><br>8th March<br></div>A quick trip to Sala&#39;s Camp in the National Reserve.
