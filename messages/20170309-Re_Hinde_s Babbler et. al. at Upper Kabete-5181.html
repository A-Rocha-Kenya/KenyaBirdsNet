<div dir="ltr">Hi Sidney,<div><br></div><div>Great to learn that you found the Hinde&#39;s Babblers on the University farm again  (I should note for the record that the date of our sighting reported to this list was incorrect, it was actually Sunday Feb 26th).  A some wonderful other species on your list, very nice that you found an Irania there. </div><div><br></div><div>I had a female Golden-winged sunbird in my yard off Lower Kabete later in the day on Feb 26th, came in to one of our birdbaths to drink.  I have seen them regularly from April through June on the Farm but this was the earliest I have recorded.  James Bradley tells me that his research shows regular presence in the Nairobi area from Feb through June/July.  </div><div><br></div><div>A male Beautiful Sunbird has shown up regularly the last two years in a Fever Tree neighbouring my yard, and assuming it is the same individual, appeared again this Sunday March 5th for the first time this year.   Again, James&#39; research and eBird records show regular occurrence in the area during the first 2-3 months of the year.   </div><div><br></div><div>I seems to me as a relative newcomer to this list that the eBird resource is woefully underused by Kenyan birders.  It&#39;s free to sign up and very easy to search for historical records  If offered Titus/Peter at Nature Kenya to provide an introduction to it to anyone interested in learning how to use it.  I don&#39;t want to get into pros and cons of different databases and tools, which I believe comes down to personal preferences, but if the eBird data could somehow be made available to the Kenya Bird Atlas project, and vice versa, we would have a set of incredibly powerful tools available to birders of all levels of experience.  </div><div><br></div><div>Best to all,</div><div><br></div><div>Simon</div></div>
