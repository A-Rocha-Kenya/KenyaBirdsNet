    <p>Last week we carried out a first census of House Crows in Watamu
      for some time - 2,774 crows counted but I know there ate many more
      ee missed that passed behind trees. We aim to repeat the count to
      compare results, but the last count in 2013Â  was about half this
      number anyway...<br>
      <br>
      Getting involved with and contributing to the Kenya Bird Map to
      achieve solid coverage of the coastal strip will provide excellent
      data on House Crow distribution and abundance. Furthermore it will
      give a clear indication of presence and abundance of the other
      indigenous species and as we (hopefully) start a poisoning
      programme of the crows soon, will give very clear results as to
      the impact of the poisoning in reducing crow numbers coupled with
      how the local bird populations bounce back in response. <br>
      <br>
      Join us in painting the coastal strip green - I.e. Four Full
      Protocol cards per pentad (atlas square) which turns the pentad
      green on the <a
        href="http://kenyabirdmap.adu.org.za/coverage.php#menu_top">Coverage
        Map </a>on the atlas website. Four cards for a pentad means you
      can do some nice statistics on the reporting rate to give a good
      picture of abundance of a species. <br>
      <br>
      Atlassing is really enjoyable, is a stimulating challenge, helps
      to hone your birding skills as well as allows you to contribute to
      the key bird project to fees into bird conservation over the next
      decade... Please do join us - write to
