    <p>This is hugely true, Don. Research in South Africa where they
      have also had a major problem with House Crows has shown clearly
      that suburbs where refuse was properly disposed of had very few
      crows whereas suburbs where refuse was left lying in overflowing
      bins etc had a major crow problem. <br>

            <p>The huge increases that we are seeing in House Crows is
              directly <br>
              related to the increase in uncollected garbage that litter
              so many of <br>
              our coastal towns. In addition to the control efforts
              already <br>
              underway, surely an equal amount of effort should go into
              getting the <br>
              local councils to re-install a proper refuge collection
              unit, that <br>
              would go a long way in reducing crow numbers. Just look
              back to the <br>
              times when these councils did have efficient garbage
              disposal teams <br>
              (not that long ago) and compare crow number then to what
              they are <br>
              today.<br>
