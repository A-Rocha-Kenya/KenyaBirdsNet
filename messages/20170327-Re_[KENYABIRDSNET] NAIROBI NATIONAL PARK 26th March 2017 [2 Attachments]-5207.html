Although the Visa/Mpesa<br>thing had to be negotiated along with everyone else arriving at NNP,<br>we were still through the gate at 6.45am.<br><br>It was another mapping day, and another resounding success. Nowadays<br>it is not possible to cover the entire Park and sacrifices had to be<br>made. We did not do Hippo Pools, Pipeline or Eland Hollow and Empakasi<br>Dams on this occasion. Undoubtedly species were missed by not visiting<br>these spots, but even so there were 43 species recorded last Sunday<br>not seen today. To give some idea of the species variety in this Park,<br>an amazing 220 species were recorded today, of which an impressive 46<br>species were palearctic migrants which is probably a record in itself.<br>The country’s most copious pentad (a square of less than 9 kilometre<br>sides) containing Hyena and Nagalomon Dams, Kisembe Forest and Dams,<br>and Kingfisher Picnic Site provided a new single visit total with a<br>staggering 175 species. We had 125 species before we had arrived at<br>Hyena Dam for breakfast, having only visited Ivory Burning Site,<br>Nagalomon Dam and the back road towards Hyena Dam. We left the Hyena<br>Dam with over 140. It was a day of really good birds, and a new<br>species for the Park (in recent times) with a Greater Sand Plover at<br>Athi Dam, the first substantiated record for NNP (see images), the<br>previous claim being almost forty years ago (also Athi Dam). A new<br>personal bird in NNP on each of the two consecutive Sundays is<br>surprising, my list now at 510 species personally recorded in the<br>Park. Nairobi National Park you are still absolutely amazing, even in<br>the grip of drought and the threat of a change for the bad with the<br>progress of the railway.<br><br>Whilst quite a list of species was recorded in the Car Park first<br>thing, nearly all were recorded later. Our first stop was Ivory<br>Burning Site, there had been a light shower during the night but<br>nothing much and the moisture was not visible. Our only Harrier of the<br>day was a female Western Marsh, a few Eurasian Bee-eaters were in the<br>area, some half-dozen or more Common Nightingales were skulking in the<br>bushes, Zanzibar Sombre Greenbuls were prominent in the morning<br>chorus, the first of ten Isabelline Shrikes seen today, looked like<br>the bird in the same place last week, an Isabelline Wheatear was one<br>of only three seen today, but the Spotted Flycatcher was one of at<br>least twenty.<br><br>Heading to Nagalomon Dam we had a number of warblers along the<br>Causeway in the Rus, single Garden, Eurasian Reed and Marsh Warblers,<br>but the prize went to a fat Upcher’s dishwashing with its tail. There<br>were also the first of some twenty Willow Warblers today, and the<br>first of four Olivaceous. Also in the bushes were a female Red-backed<br>Shrike which was the first of five of which three were adult males,<br>the first of twelve Whinchats, and a male Pied Wheatear. The strangest<br>bird on the Causeway was probably a Laughing Dove eating Rus berries!<br>On the dam itself were five Darters, single Black-crowned Night,<br>Purple and Squacco Herons, one Great and two Yellow-billed Egrets,<br>four White-faced Whistling Duck and a White-winged Black Tern. Also<br>three African Spoonbills, but no migrant waders.<br><br>Now we took the back road to Hyena Dam, which was on the whole quiet,<br>apart from a very handsome pale Booted Eagle and pair of Gabar<br>Goshawks, a couple of Blue-headed (flava) Yellow Wagtails, a<br>Rosy-breasted Longclaw, a female Eurasian Rock Thrush and the first of<br>six Red-tailed (Turkestan) Shrikes. There were small groups of<br>Red-billed Quelea but only one White-winged Widowbird, in fact the<br>only Euplectes seen today. Amongst the hirundines feeding were two<br>Banded and one Sand Martin.<br>At Hyena Dam it continued attractive to waders, with two African<br>Jacana, thirty-five Black-winged Stilts, what seemed more than ten<br>Long-toed Plovers but they are difficult to count being all around the<br>dam and also on the run-off, four Spur-winged Plovers, eight Little<br>Stint, two Ruff, three Common Snipe, the faithful Black-tailed Godwit,<br>forty Wood and six Common Sandpipers, other swamp birds were a<br>Yellow-billed Egret, male Saddle-billed Stork, six African Spoonbills,<br>eight White-faced Whistling Duck, African Water Rail still at the<br>bases of the vanished reeds, and a Grey Crowned Crane. No sign of Fish<br>Eagles, but there were Tawny Eagle and adult Martial Eagle. A Nyanza<br>Swift came and had a quick sip before flying off. The prize on the<br>causeway where there were several Willow Warblers was a nice Icterine<br>Warbler. It perched openly but always briefly in bushes below us<br>before moving off. When we lost it we played recordings of song<br>(actually from NNP) and it came flying straight in which is very<br>unusual for a migrant warbler but was still very active and<br>disappearing into the shrubs. It disappeared again but the App brought<br>it back, we never did get a good image of it though! (See Image).<br><br>We headed back towards Nagalomon Dam with a Northern Wheatear on the<br>Ivory Burning Arena where a Common Buzzard was flying low overhead,<br>and continued to Kisembe Forest taking the circuit around towards<br>Langata Gate. Amongst raptors consisting mainly of White-backed<br>Vultures was one each of Common, Augur and what looked like a<br>dark-phase Long-legged Buzzard but being nearly mid-day in a cloudless<br>sky looked virtually black below but it was a very big bird (See<br>Images). There was also a Yellow-billed Stork flying over very high.<br>We stumbled on a Thrush Nightingale feeding quietly under a bush, a<br>stop at the rubbish-tip Vlei rewarded us with two Yellow-billed<br>Egrets, a Eurasian Roller, several lutea Yellow Wagtails and three<br>Red-throated Pipits. Further down the road was a Crowned Eagle and on<br>Langata Dam a male Greater Paintedsnipe.<br><br>Just as we left the forest arriving back on the main bottom road,<br>there was an adult and an immature Martial Eagle sitting quietly, a<br>pair of Brown-backed Woodpeckers neither with any red on the head and<br>likely siblings from a nearby nest, and were very noisy. Several<br>Fischer’s Lovebirds were here which was an unusual site for them.<br>Kingfisher area was extremely quiet although the days only<br>Secretarybird was near here, and we continued on to Leopard Cliffs not<br>finding very much apart from the days only Pangani Longclaw, a pair of<br>Fish Eagles and male White-bellied Bustard on the other side of Baboon<br>Cliffs.<br><br>In Rhino Circuit we found some dry forest birds which included a<br>Grey-headed Kingfisher, Banded Parisoma, Red-throated Tits and<br>Black-faced Waxbill. Whilst Athi Dam was more interesting than usual<br>attracting good numbers of waders, ten Spur-winged, eight Kittlitz’s,<br>six Common Ringed and the bird of the day, a Greater Sand Plover,<br>twenty Little Stint, three Ruff, two Marsh, twenty Woods, eight Common<br>and what might be the seasons last two Green Sandpipers, finally the<br>only Greenshank of the day. A White-winged Black Tern patrolled the<br>shoreline, whilst there was the strange sight of two Spur-winged Geese<br>in the shallows. A Black-crowned Night-Heron roosted on the Causeway,<br>amongst the Marabous were eight each of Yellow-billed and White<br>Storks, fifteen African Spoonbills, four Red-billed Teal, and three<br>Grey Crowned Cranes. Pulling away from the dam there was a compact<br>group of seven Eurasian Rollers with another two singles above Athi<br>Basin.<br><br>Now heading back towards Main Gate we found the days only<br>Black-shouldered Kite, a pair of Lappet-faced Vultures on top of a<br>Balanites that they have nested in before, two Lesser Kestrels and a<br>Steppe Eagle, plus a male Kori Bustard displaying to a female. Closer<br>to the Beacon was the seasons first Lesser Grey Shrike. Back at Hyena<br>Dam not much had changed, but in a short section were 115 sleeping<br>Wood Sandpipers whilst there were probably another forty feeding<br>around the dam, the final new bird for the day being a Common Kestrel.<br><br>Whilst it was a day that you could not say had experienced a good fall<br>of migrants there were plenty to see. Amongst the number were some<br>fine finds. Barn Swallows were the most numerous but good numbers of<br>shrikes, Whinchats and Spotted Flycatchers. Large numbers of<br>Isabelline Wheatears must have pulled out, with three today compared<br>to fifteen last week. Willow Warbler numbers greatly increasing, and<br>although all other warblers in very small numbers, there was good<br>variety.<br><br>Mammals more numerous in the south and Athi Basin, the only Lions of<br>the day were three in rubbish-tip vlei.<br><br>We were through the gate at 6.00pm having had a superlative day on all<br>counts, remarkable considering just how dry it was.<br><br>Best to all,<br>Brian<br><br>As a footnote, there was a half-inch of rain last night and on Monday<br>27th I had a look in our paddock which is in the same Pentad as Hyena<br>Dam. There was a good fall of migrants, nearly all Willow Warbler with<br>excess of thirty, and just one Garden and Spotted Flycatcher. Nine<br>Tree Pipits were feeding on the ground under the trees, and three<br>Eurasian Rollers indicated that there was a good movement of the<br>species locally, especially with the ten in NNP Sunday. There were a<br>few Eurasian Bee-eaters but then they have been present most days<br>since their arrival last September.<br>In the short time I had African Goshawk, Montane Nightjar,<br>Yellow-rumped Tinkerbird, Red-rumped Swallow, Yellow-whiskered<br>Greenbul, Black-collared Apalis, Violet-backed Starling, Tree Pipit,<br>Parrot-billed Sparrow and Golden –breasted Bunting none of which made<br>any appearance yesterday!<br><br>KEY TO MONTAGE<br><br>TOP TWO LEFT AND SECOND ROW FAR LEFT TWO<br>GREATER SAND PLOVER<br>There is an historical record nearly forty years ago from Athi Dam on<br>11th Oct 1980. The only other records for Nairobi County have been two<br>sightings at Dandora in 1981 and 1988. This bird is the first where<br>there is a photographic record, it is the first ever seen on northward<br>passage in the county and the second record for NNP although relegated<br>to the appendix for unsubstantiated historical records in the NNP<br>Checklist.<br><br>THIRD ROW FAR LEFT<br>GREATER PAINTEDSNIPE<br>This lone male was on the drying Langata Dam and is the first record<br>for this corner of the Park.<br><br>TOP RIGHT<br>SPUR-WINGED GEESE<br>This pair were on the open shore-line of Athi Dam, usually associated<br>with more vegetated habitats.<br><br>SECOND ROW FAR RIGHT<br>MARSH SANDPIPER<br>This bird at Athi Dam is in advanced breeding plumage.<br><br>THIRD AND BOTTOM ROWS FAR RIGHT<br>KORI BUSTARD<br>This male was displaying to a female right near the vehicle on top of<br>Athi Basin.<br><br>THIRD ROW SECOND FROM LEFT<br>LAUGHING DOVE<br>The lost bird feeding on Rus berries on the Nagalomon Dam causeway.<br><br>THIRD ROW THIRD FROM LEFT<br>HYBRID SHRIKE<br>Migrant shrikes were very much on show today, with a combined total of<br>22 individuals covering four species, but the passage is really only<br>just getting underway. As well as sorting out the Red-tailed from the<br>Isabellines which is not so difficult at this time of year, now and<br>again a spanner is thrown into the works and hybrids show up.<br>This bird is very crisply plumaged and has a silvery-grey head with no<br>rufous, however the back is rusty tinged, the underparts uniform<br>white, and the tail is black with red confined to the extreme base,<br>rump and outer-tail feathers. This would suggest the product of a<br>meeting of Red-tailed (phoenicuroides) and Red-backed Shrikes, but the<br>uniform very white underparts suggest.<br><br>THIRD ROW (INSET) FAR RIGHT<br>ICTERINE WARBLER<br>This was the best image Washington could manage on the Hyena Dam<br>Causeway, the bird was so active.<br><br>BOTTOM ROW THREE LEFT IMAGES<br>LONG-LEGGED BUZZARD (?)<br>This bird was a problem to ID. It was a very large raptor, looking the<br>size of an Aquila, further enhanced by the projecting neck and when<br>completing a circle, the primaries were held upswept. Whilst watching<br>the bird Long-legged Buzzard was thought likely, with a secondary<br>choice of Wahlberg’s Eagle because of the longish tail, and long<br>squared wings, and all blackish appearance. It was nearly the middle<br>of the day, the sun was bright and near directly overhead. With the<br>naked eye nothing but blackish was discernible, the bird was around<br>for over five minutes flying all the time into the wind with the<br>primaries swept back and angled, and made very slow forward progress.<br>Every now and then it would make a large circle with fully splayed<br>flight-feathers with upswept primaries and return to more or less the<br>same patch of sky. A reason why the identification leant towards a<br>dark Long-legged Buzzard rather than Wahlberg’s Eagle was that the<br>latter has six visible primaries, but Long-legged Buzzard has five and<br>this is a major structural difference. Washington took a number of<br>images of the bird in flight, but to show how technology can reveal<br>details that the eye cannot see, when they were downloaded various<br>plumage features were now discernible. The two leftmost images are how<br>the bird appeared to us, the rightmost is the right image lightened on<br>the computer alongside the original. Given that it was mid-day and a<br>hazy hot one, atmospheric distortion must be expected, but it appears<br>that; primaries are blackish and there are clearly on five projecting<br>in the “hand”; The bases of the flight feathers and outer secondaries<br>are whitish; the underwing coverts are paler than the carpal area and<br>paler than the inner secondaries; although this could be an artefact<br>of distortion, the belly appears to be darker than the lower belly to<br>vent which appears rusty; the tail is very pale below narrowly banded<br>ending in a broader terminal band; the head and neck protrude<br>markedly. This is a very interesting and very large bird, but the<br>tapering protruding hind end together with the tail appear to extend<br>further back than would be expected on a Long-legged Buzzard. Comments<br>on this are invited.<o:p></o:p></p></div><div><p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'><o:p></o:p></span></p></div></div><br />
