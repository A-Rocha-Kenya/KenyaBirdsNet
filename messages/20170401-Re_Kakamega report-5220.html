<div dir='auto'><div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13.696px;" dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 13.696px;">Hi Adam and nice report. There were indeed two Pied Flycatchers in the KFS compound at Kakamega on the morning of the 29th, which were photographed. Other nice birds were several calling Red-chested Owlets and Buff-spotted Flufftails through the night of the 30th. A calling Grey-chested Illadopsis along the stream at the pumhouse was a nice addition to the day list. Very interesting to hear you had a Pied Fly in Nandi Forest too.</span><br></div><div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13.696px;" dir="auto"><div style="margin: 16px 0px;"><div dir="auto"><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">I'm curious as to the Little Grey Greenbul though. Having listened to many hours of audio from Kakamega, as well as a good deal of field obs too, I firmly believe this species does not occur in Kakamega, if it ever did.</div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">It seems the field characteristics for separation from Ansorge's are thin at best, and the rattle call attributed to the species on the EA App actually belongs to Ansorge's. Several times I've watched an Ansorge's sing, only to then give that same rattle call. This was also the finding of Caroline McBride in recordings on the Macaulay Library, and her ear is almost second to none. &nbsp;The birds fast jerky song with ascending terminal note is absent from the Kakamega soundscape. Incidentally, the rattle call also does not sound like the bird in West Africa. That&nbsp;Dale Zimmerman was unable to find any clear ecological segregation between the presumed two forms is another nail in the coffin for me.</div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">Can anyone provide definitive evidence that Little Grey occurs in Kakmega? Where are the purported old specimens?</div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">Best Wishes, James</div></div><div dir="auto"><br><div dir="auto" style="color: rgb(66, 133, 244); font-stretch: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; padding: 24px 0px;">Show quoted text</div><br></div></div><div style="height: 0px;"></div></div><div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13.696px; height: 96px;" dir="auto"></div><br></div></body>
