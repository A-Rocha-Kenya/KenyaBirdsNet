<div class="moz-text-flowed">While atlassing the Kijabe pentad yesterday I had an experience I don't 
recall having had before - in about just 20 minutes I saw no less than 
eight species of sunbird in one tree: Variable, Bronze, Tacazze, 
Collared, Amethyst, Green-headed, Northern Double-collared and Malachite 
-- and five minutes earlier I had been watching a ninth - Eastern 
Double-collared (which was in the same tree as the others this morning). 
I've also just added a tenth to the list - Scarlet-chested Sunbird and 
last week I had Golden-winged as well. Amazingly the tree was not an 
indigenous tree as might be expected but a Eucalyptus in full flower. 
There were also White-fronted and Cinnamon-chested Bee-eaters, weavers, 
bulbuls, sparrows, white-eyes and a lone Willow Warbler in the same tree 
(oh, and a nest with a large chick of an African Harrier Hawk which had 
an adult Great Sparrowhawk visit and sit there for a good 30 minutes...).
<br>
<br>At the beginning of the month at the Fundamentals of Ornithology course 
held at Elsamere in Naivasha there were very few sunbirds - I think 
there was just one record of Variable in the whole week (normally very 
common there), a handful of Bronze and that was pretty much it for 
sunbirds. Presumably with the very dry conditions they've moved up to 
higher elevations...
<br>
<br>Other good species for the atlas card which I finished yesterday 
included Rufous-breasted Sparrowhawk, Abyssinian Crimsonwing and Grey 
Cuckoo-shrike...
<br>
<br>This morning I started another atlas card and had 29 species in 25 
minutes in only about a 300 m walk...
<br>
<br>Viva atlassing!!
<br>
<br>Anyone interested in atlassing who is not yet registered, please 
register with the Kenya Bird Map office <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:kenyabirdmap@naturekenya.org">&lt;kenyabirdmap@naturekenya.org&gt;</a>. 
If you have a smart phone download the free BirdLasser app that is 
superb for just keeping your own birding observations but also makes 
atlassing incredibly easy...
