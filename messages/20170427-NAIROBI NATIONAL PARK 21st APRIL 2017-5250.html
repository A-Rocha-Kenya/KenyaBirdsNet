Dear All,
On 21st April, Karen Plumbe, Heather Elkin, Jennifer Oduori and myself
entered the Main Gate of Nairobi National Park. Once again there were
no delays with the new system and we were inside by 6.40am. There had
been some recent rain and it was enough to slightly raise the levels
of Hyena and Nagalomon Dams and the Mokoyeti was flowing but not in a
great hurry.

We first visited Ivory Burning Site, it was quite quiet and most
migrants have now left us. There were five Garden Warblers most well
hidden but a couple of extraverts, the first of three Common
Whitethroat, the first of well over one-hundred Willow Warblers for
the day, and the first of only five Spotted Flycatchers. The Zanzibar
Sombre Greenbul was in full song near the choos, but the trees were
not very productive. Chestnut Weavers flew over, but were the only
ones seen whilst on Mukoma Estate we have been invaded by these and
Red-billed Queleas and the weavers are nest building.</pre></div></body>
