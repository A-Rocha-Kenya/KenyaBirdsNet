<div dir="ltr">Hi all,<div><br>I had a sighting of 1 Hinde&#39;s Babbler today at the University of Nairobi Upper Kabete field station, in the same general area as where we saw them in March during the Nature Kenya bird walk. Last time we saw 3 but today there only seemed to be a single one. I played a recording of their call for over 10 minutes to see if any others respond but to no avail. So whether the other 2 are still around is uncertain for now. </div><div>Jackson&#39;s Widowbirds in full breeding plumage are also around. I counted at least 4 males and 2 females. Red-collared and White-winged W were in large numbers all over. <br><br>Best regards,<br>Sidney</div></div>
