    <p>Hi Nate</p>
    <p>Indigobird identification is not especially straight forward and
      you really need to consider vocal mimicry, bare parts colouration
      and plumage gloss colour and intensity to make an accurate
      identification.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Firstly, if I&#39;m not mistaken, Variable/Dusky Indigobird and
      Purple Indigobird are different species. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Based on work I&#39;ve done in South Africa, it certainly isn&#39;t
      Purple Indigobird (which has a dull purple gloss), and I don&#39;t
      believe it&#39;s Dusky Indigobird either (which has a weak dark blue
      gloss). Based on gloss intensity alone I would suggest Village
      Indigobird. I agree that the legs would be expected to be brighter
      for Village Indigobird, but at least the bill is paler than the
      legs. I&#39;ve only seen Wilson&#39;s Indigobird once, but I don&#39;t think
      the gloss or leg colour match it.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Kind regards<br>
      Michael<br>
    </p>

            <p>I just received some photos Roger Smith took of a
              roadside Indigobird<br>
              we saw with Ben Mugambi in the Trans Mara back in late
              January when<br>
              things were so dry. It looks to be Variable / Purple
              Indigobird but<br>
              I would welcome correction by anyone better versed in
              Indigobird<br>
              identification.<br>
              <br>
              I&#39;m also wondering if the hue is blue enough to call it a
              Variable<br>
              Indigobird, though I know how subjective things like blue
              sheen can<br>
              be...<br>
              <br>
              Unfortunately my camera was packed away at the time.
              Roger&#39;s was too<br>
              for the Bar-breasted Firefinch we saw just before the
              Indigobird.<br>
              But he scrambled to unpack his camera just in time for the
              second<br>
              find.<br>
              <br>
              Attached are a few cropped photos.<br>
              <br>
              Good birding,<br>
              <br>
              Nate<br>
              <br>
              PS<br>
              The (male) Bar-breasted Firefinch had a striking pattern
              around the<br>
              undertail coverts. Sort of cream-coloured undertail
              coverts with a<br>
              thin darker border then the light grey/brown of the bird&#39;s
              vent and<br>
              flanks. I will post something about them soon, as I am
              wondering if<br>
              their different appearance from Red-billed Firefinch is a
              valid field<br>
              mark for separating the two species.</p></div></div></div></blockquote><span class="HOEnZb"><font color="#888888">
