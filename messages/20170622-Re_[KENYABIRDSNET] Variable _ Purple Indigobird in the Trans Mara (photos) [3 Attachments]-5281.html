    <p>Hi Nate</p>
    <p>No problem. Indigobirds are tricky, so it's always good to look
      at them and I don't think you should consider it time wasting even
      if it is a Village Indigobird. Everyone can learn something from
      this and I may be wrong.<br>
    </p>
    <p>My guess is that variability between individuals in leg colour
      would be greater than variation in gloss intensity and colour, so
      based on that I would suggest Village Indigobird. But in truth we
      don't know much about individual variation in these features, so
      it is still a guess.</p>
    <p>Overall I'm of the opinion that there is too much emphasis on leg
      and bill colour when it comes to indigobird identification.<br>
    </p>
    <p>All the best<br>
      Michael<br>

                  <p>Hi Nate</p>
                  <p>Indigobird identification is not especially
                    straight forward and you really need to consider
                    vocal mimicry, bare parts colouration and plumage
                    gloss colour and intensity to make an accurate
                    identification.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firstly, if I'm not mistaken, Variable/Dusky
                    Indigobird and Purple Indigobird are different
                    species. <br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Based on work I've done in South Africa, it
                    certainly isn't Purple Indigobird (which has a dull
                    purple gloss), and I don't believe it's Dusky
                    Indigobird either (which has a weak dark blue
                    gloss). Based on gloss intensity alone I would
                    suggest Village Indigobird. I agree that the legs
                    would be expected to be brighter for Village
                    Indigobird, but at least the bill is paler than the
                    legs. I've only seen Wilson's Indigobird once, but I
                    don't think the gloss or leg colour match it.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Kind regards<br>

                          <p>I just received some photos Roger Smith
                            took of a roadside Indigobird<br>
                            we saw with Ben Mugambi in the Trans Mara
                            back in late January when<br>
                            things were so dry. It looks to be Variable
                            / Purple Indigobird but<br>
                            I would welcome correction by anyone better
                            versed in Indigobird<br>
                            identification.<br>
                            <br>
                            I'm also wondering if the hue is blue enough
                            to call it a Variable<br>
                            Indigobird, though I know how subjective
                            things like blue sheen can<br>
                            be...<br>
                            <br>
                            Unfortunately my camera was packed away at
                            the time. Roger's was too<br>
                            for the Bar-breasted Firefinch we saw just
                            before the Indigobird.<br>
                            But he scrambled to unpack his camera just
                            in time for the second<br>
                            find.<br>
                            <br>
                            Attached are a few cropped photos.<br>

                            PS<br>
                            The (male) Bar-breasted Firefinch had a
                            striking pattern around the<br>
                            undertail coverts. Sort of cream-coloured
                            undertail coverts with a<br>
                            thin darker border then the light grey/brown
                            of the bird's vent and<br>
                            flanks. I will post something about them
                            soon, as I am wondering if<br>
                            their different appearance from Red-billed
                            Firefinch is a valid field<br>
                            mark for separating the two species.</p>
