    <p>We've been staying for a short while in Kijabe and it has been
      great to do some up-country birding. Juggling work and looking
      after a 4-year old means atlassing is a bit of a challenge but
      yesterday I hit the magic 100 species for a pentad mark with 103
      total - and that is without a single waterbird species! What
      helped was visiting 'The Forest' - an ecotourism project in
      Kureita forest near Gatamaiyu where I picked up Mountain Buzzard,
      Scarce Swift, Horus Swift (interesting to have those at such high
      altitude??), Brown-capped Weaver and Mountain Greenbul. That was
      an afternoon visit - an early morning visit with a focus on
      birding would bound to add several more species... (which Patrick
      Ngotho demonstrated with his <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="http://kenyabirdmap.adu.org.za/pentad_info.php?pentad=0055_3635#menu_top">card
        of 83 species in Feb</a> this year).<br>
    </p>
    <p>Species of note at the lower altitude of Kijabe which are new to
      my list over the past 2 months included Cardinal Woodpecker (seen
      by Jeff Davis and added to the pentad card), Long-billed Pipit,
      African Firefinch, Yellow-necked Spurfowl (apparently maybe not
      really recorded for Kijabe before - but then, there are a number
      of species which have arrived here over the past few years... a
      drying climate and removal of forest...), Red-throated Wryneck,
      White-browed Scrub Robin and Long-crested Eagle (which used to be
      common here but these days is rarely seen apparently). Also there
      are swathes of Leonotis flowering in the shambas slightly lower
      than Kijabe (c. 2,000 m) - and there were literally dozens of
      Golden-winged Sunbirds on them - and just one Bronze... <br>
    </p>
    <p>Bizarrely (and this is one of the many interesting things with
      atlassing with a set protocol as with the Bird Map), the 103
      species did not include species I would totally have expected such
      as Black Kite, Little Swift, Tacazze Sunbird (which I've seen a
      lot around most of the time), Eastern Double-collared Sunbird and
      Grey-headed Sparrow..</p>
