<div dir="ltr">Dear all,<br><br>Birding in NNP today produced some notable sightings: A Bat Hawk spotted near Kingfisher, a Woolly-necked Stork souring above the Mbagathi Gorge not far from Maasai Gate and at least 5 White-crested Helmet-shrikes at Hippo Pools.<div>Â A few migrants were present including Common, Wood and Green Sandpipers, Little Stint, Common Greenshank and Barn Swallow. None in great numbers. Of mammals, an Egyptian Mongoose near Kingfisher and a leopard near Emakoko were pleasant surprises. The park remains very dry, although a few new puddles of water have formed from the recent brief showers.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Sidney</div></div>
