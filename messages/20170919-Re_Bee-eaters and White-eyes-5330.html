<div dir="ltr">Hi all.<br><br>To add on to my email from yesterday, another Yellow White-eye was ringed at the Nairobi museum today. This makes it the 2nd to be ringed there, the 1st being last week. Also, the Slate-coloured Boubou ringed in January (also 1st ringing record in Nairobi) and re-trapped in Feb was re-trapped for the 2nd time today.<br><br>Best,<br><br>Sidney</div><div class="gmail_extra"><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Mon, Sep 18, 2017 at 5:37 PM, Sidney Shema Kamanzi <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:sidneyshema@gmail.com" target="_blank">sidneyshema@gmail.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex"><div dir="ltr">Hi birders,<br><br>On a Nature Kenya bird walk yesterday at Kikwata Picnic Site on the Ngong Hills, we had a brief sighting of a small flock of Eurasian Bee-eaters flying high and calling. Interestingly, we also had 3 white-eye species: plenty of Abyssinian, a single Montane/Kikuyu and 2 Yellow. On Tuesday last week, we also ringed a Yellow White-eye at the Nairobi National Museum. I think this is the first individual of this species ever ringed at the museum, but this needs to be confirmed from the records.<br><br>Best regards,<br>Sidney</div>
