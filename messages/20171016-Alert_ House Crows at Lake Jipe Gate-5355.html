Dear All,

As many of you might be aware: The shore of Lake Jipe is a birding hotspot
and absolute gem for bird enthusiasts.

While I was checking out a nesting site of Taveta Golden Weavers at Lake
Jipe Gate/Tsavo West Southern Section on Saturday afternoon there was this
all too familiar call of House Crows(2), which, to my utter dismay, were
perching in an acacia near the Lake Jipe Bandas/Gate. Apart from old nests
there was no sign of the TGW. I had a look again on Sunday morning only to
find a lone male TGW at the site and one Crow in the tree.

Although I have asked the KWS staff at the gate to monitor the invaders I
am not really expecting much support from them; at the same time I informed
the park management and suggested to have the crows shot before they
increase in numbers, though not sure if any action will be taken!

Apart from this shocking encounter I mapped 96 species in this pentad from
Friday afternoon till Sunday morning including a few palearctic migrants
like Barn Swallows (in large number), Yellow Wagtail(1), Eurasian Marsh
Harrier, Northern Wheatear, Common Quail, Whiskered Tern and White-winged
Black Tern!

Other species in large numbers were Greater &amp; Reed Cormorant, Common
Squacco, Black-crowned Night-Heron in the reeds (flew up and must have been
around 100), White-winged Black Terns!</pre></div></body>
