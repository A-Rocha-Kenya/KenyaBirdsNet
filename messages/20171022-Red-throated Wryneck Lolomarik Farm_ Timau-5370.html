<p><span>Dear all</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>I was lucky to have an unusual and very unexpected sighting on Lelwel grounds within Lolomarik Farm, Timau two days ago... A red-throated wryneck! It wasn&#39;t shy at all but as I was in the process of collecting a washing machine I was completely un-prepared without my camera etc... Typical! I&#39;ve only ever seen one before and that was on Loldia Farm, Naivasha so I was very excited!</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>Lots of barn swallows around Timau area but otherwise migrants few and far between at present.</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Kieran</span></p><p><span><br class="yui-cursor"></span></p></body>
