    <p>So many of us who spend time birding or in the field end up
      seeing things of real interest - be it an unusual record or number
      of birds, interaction between species or a form of behaviour.
      Most, if not all of these observations are very relevant to our
      understanding of the birds or other biodiversity around us - and
      yet most of the observations end up at best staying in our note
      book or maybe being put out there on a list server like
      kenyabirdsnet. <br>
    </p>
    <p>I've mentioned the online journal '<a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://journals.uct.ac.za/index.php/BO/">Biodiversity
        Observations</a>' previously - which is specifically designed to
      receive and publish those sorts of observations - ones that a
      peer-reviewed journal would not accept. <br>
    </p>
    <p>The journal has just had an upgrade and is now officially hosted
      by the University of Cape Town <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext"
        href="https://journals.uct.ac.za/index.php/BO/">https://journals.uct.ac.za/index.php/BO/</a>
      and even better it is now searched by <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://scholar.google.co.za/schhp?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,5">Google
        Scholar</a> - so if you search for anything that has been
      published in BO, it will pick it up. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Just to encourage those who have not published much before, try
      it... enter in Google Scholar 'camels snacking' and you'll get
      John Gitiri's paper on the observation he put out on this list
      server about camels eating weaver nests. He wrote it up and it has
      been published - one of only a handful of publications /
      references pretty much on any animal consuming birds nests... <br>
    </p>
    <p>Many of the observations reported in this list server would
      actually qualify for publication in Biodiversity Observations -
      and I'd encourage all and anyone with such records to do so...</p>
    <p>FYI, the description of the journal on the website states:</p>
    <p><strong><span class="journal_name">Biodiversity Observations</span></strong> is
      the continuation of <span class="journal_name">Ornithological
        Observations</span> (volumes 1 to 6), it is a semi-scientific
      e-journal published by the Animal Demography Unit at the
      University of Cape Town.</p>
    <p><strong><span class="journal_name">Biodiversity Observations</span></strong> accepts
      papers containing information about biodiversity in general. This
      includes descriptions of distribution, behaviour, breeding,
      foraging, food, movement, measurements, habitat and
      colouration/plumage. It will also consider for publication a
      variety of other interesting or relevant biodiversity material:
      reports of projects and conferences, annotated checklists for a
      site or region, specialist bibliographies, book reviews and any
      other interesting or relevant material. Further details and
      guidelines to authors are on this website.</p>
    <strong><span class="journal_name">Biodiversity Observations</span></strong> aims
    to create a platform for scientists and citizen scientists to
    publish a variety of biodiversity related contributions as quickly
    as possible. The papers will not be peer-reviewed or refereed, but
    the Edtiorial Committee will ensure a high standard is maintained.
    We encourage dialogue and discussion, so papers reflecting on topics
    already published will be considered. We invite interested parties
    from all walks of life to submit contributions to be considered for
    publication.
    <p>It would be great to see a lot more being published from Kenya...<br>
