Greetings birders

Some records from the week I spent in Dakatcha Woodland, 22-29 March 2018:

Brachystegia (Mrihi) trees were in bright new leaf, and some were in flower.
Many shrubs were completely covered with white or yellow flowers. There were
butterflies and caterpillars everywhere. Some seasonal wetlands had filled
with water, while seasonal wetlands on higher ground or towards the north
were still dry.

Nesting birds included Senegal Plover with two heavily spotted eggs, and a
Chestnut-fronted Helmetshrike sitting on a cuplike nest in the fork of a
tree.

Northern and intra-African migrants included Amur Falcon, Eurasian Nightjar,
many Eurasian Rollers, Northern Carmine and White-throated Bee-eaters, Barn
Swallow, Eurasian Golden Oriole, Red-backed Shrike, Willow Warbler, Common
Nightingale (and perhaps Thrush Nightingale), Spotted Flycatcher and Yellow
Wagtail.

Cuckoos included Thick-billed Cuckoo, black morph Levaillant's Cuckoo,
Klaas' Cuckoo and tentative African Cuckoo.

I remain puzzled by the starling flocks; in addition to Violet-backed and
Black-bellied starlings, there were Greater Blue-eared Starlings with many
immatures that were rufous-brown below.

Only two Clarke's Weavers were seen briefly during the week. Any reports of
Clarke's Weavers observed in Dakatcha Woodland, at any time, would be much
appreciated.

Wishing you good birding,

Fleur
