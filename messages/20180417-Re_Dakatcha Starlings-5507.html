Dear Don, James, Washington and all

Thank you for your comments regarding the starlings with reddish-brown
immatures that we saw in Dakatcha Woodland in late March.

At the time, I must confess that we were just confused. I was already
confused as to whether the Greater Blue-eared Starlings in Dakatcha were the
coastal and inland race. The focus of our monitoring was on forest birds, so
the starlings in the trees above abandoned farmland were not high priority.
I was not even aware of Southern Blue-eared Starlings.

The starlings were too far to be photographed with the little camera we had.
But I saw them well with binoculars, and some ­ evidently the immatures ­
seemed to be entirely rufous-brown below. Then I remembered that immatures
of many glossy starlings are brownish.

Blue-eared starlings in Dakatcha obviously needs more observation. Would
anyone like to organize a visit to Dakatcha Woodland?

Good birding to all, Fleur

Dear Fleur. Going back to your odd juvenile starlings, I assume others up
there could try and ascertain more details.

Lesser Blue-eared (elizabethae) is a partial migrant in West Africa, moving
north with the rains.

Although this form has never been noticed before in the Sokoke - Dakatcha
woodlands, back around 1920 Van Someone¹s collectors produced an adult from
the Vanga area, though there is a possibility that it had been collected in
Tanzania.

Juveniles of that form are indeed tawny-brown below.  How extensive was that
colour in the birds you saw.

Did Lesser blue-eared cross your mind at all, or where all adult birds taken
to be Greaters.

This is certainly worth following up if at all possible, and I am copying this
to Colin Jackson who may be down there and able to mobilise something.

If indeed they were Lessers, then it would suggest that maybe this was not the
first time they had been in the area, which is extraordinary given the
coverage that the area has had in the past.

Photos of any of these juveniles would of course be invaluable.

Hope we hear more on this.

Best wishes
Don
