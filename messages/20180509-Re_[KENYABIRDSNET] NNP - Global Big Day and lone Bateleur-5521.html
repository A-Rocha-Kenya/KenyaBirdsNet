Hi Sidney,
The male is consistently at his old nest site along the Nagalomon
River in Kisembe Forest, but as you say never a female, and I think
you are right. About four months ago there was an immature around Athi
Dam, but presumably a wanderer.
Best for now
Brian

Hi birders,

I was in the park on Saturday with Marco Pruiksma, Jennifer Oduori and
Fleur
Ng'weno for the Global Big Day. Among the birds seen were a handful of
Palearctic migrants - 3 Lesser Grey Shrikes, a Red-backed Shrike and a few
Barn Swallows. Black-shouldered Kites are now fairly common - a stark
contrast to the situation before the rains. A Jacobin Cuckoo near Hippo
Pools was also a nice sighting. Other cuckoos were Diederik, Klaas's,
Red-chested and African Emerald. Red-collared Widowbirds were all over the
plains while White-winged and Jackson's Widowbirds were only seen in the
south-western grasslands around Kingfisher. Yellow-crowned Bishops in
breeding plumage were busy displaying at the numerous seasonal marshes.
Black-crowned Night Herons, African Darters, Reed Cormorants and Sacred
Ibis are nesting in good numbers on their usual clump of trees at Nagolomon
Dam. Shorebirds in general were virtually absent from the park as there are
almost no 'shores' on any of the dams.

Something curious I've noted is that every sighting of a Bateleur that I
have had in Nairobi National Park over the past couple of years has been of
a single adult male. No females at all. It's well known that a pair has
historically nested in the park for a long time but I wonder if the female
is now dead or has dispersed for some reason (or if it's just pure chance
that I keep seeing the male). Has anyone here seen a female Bateleur (or
even a juv/imm) in NNP or any nearby areas over the last 2 years or so?

Best regards,
Sidney
