Greetings birders

The morning was dark, cold and overcast. I was ready to give up and go
inside the Nairobi National Museum. But the dozen or so birders who turned
out for Nature Kenya's Wednesday Morning Birdwalk were ready to go out, so
we went to Uhuru Gardens National Monument.

There the grass was high, green and gold, and the sun came out. Highlights
were three Grey Crowned Cranes almost disappearing as they landed in the
tall grass, and three species of cuckoo: Jacobin, Diederik and Klaas's. A
pair of Baglafecht Weavers were feeding a young Diederik Cuckoo with a
bright red bill. 

Wishing you good birding whatever the weather, Fleur
