Dear All,
There is one difference between the two birds, but could be age
related, Afam's bird has a pale eye with a very narrow red eye-ring,
from what I see of the current gull although a bit blurred and
possibly a camera artifact is that it appears all dark but comes out
reddish,
I think the gulls are probably not the same as although this is a
complex group the pale eye should suggest the older bird,
There is still no conclusive evidence of a Heuglin's Gull inland,
Best for now
Brian

Hi Adam,

Thanks for sharing this and, one has to wonder if it is the same
individual?

Both birds certainly look like plausible candidates for barabensis.

Best Wishes,

James

Thanks for this James.

The bird looks almost identical to the one I saw at the same location in
May 2013 - see images attached.

Best,
Adam

Dear Birders,

Just a quick heads-up to anyone who might be at Naivasha or heading that
way.... A large grey-backed gull species was photographed there on May
20th
and is currently thought most likely to be a Caspian Gull or a Steppe
Gull.
The bird was on Crescent Island and it's possible it's still there.
Please
keep an eye out for it if you happen to be on the lake as further photos
and notes could be useful. The original photos can be seen here:
