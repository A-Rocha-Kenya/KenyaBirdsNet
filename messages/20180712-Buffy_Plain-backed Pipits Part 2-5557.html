<div dir="ltr"><div>Dear Birders,</div><div><br></div><div>Further to my earlier post about these pipits and the query as to whether zenkeri Plain-backed Pipit has ever been photographed in central Kenya, I received two photos attached here from Bruno Boedts. This pipit was found just to the north of Nyeri and clearly illustrates the as yet unexplained variation in pipits from east to west across central and southern Kenya.</div><div></div><div><br></div><div>This bird looks like it could belong with the Plain-backed group, being quite different to central Kenyan goodsoni, now widely thought to be allied with Buffy Pipit of South Africa. However, it is also quite different to Plain-backed Anthus leucophrys zenkeri that occurs in the Lake Victoria basin north to the slopes of Mt Elgon in western Kenya.</div><div><br></div><div>As shown in the other two attached images, zenkeri is a large form with sturdy legs and a stout bill. By contrast, this bird from near Nyeri is much more diminutive in appearance with a rather fine bill. It also lacks the warm cinnamon edges to the coverts and on the underside, or contrast with white throat of zenkeri, being a much colder chocolate brown above with little in the way of cinnamon tones. The facial pattern and spectacled look is fitting for Plain-backed but I have never seen a zenkeri in western Kenya with such sharp features, including the neatly contrasting rusty auriculars.</div><div><br></div><div>Even allowing for the quirks of photographs such as lighting, and judging size. Or for variation between individuals, such as feather wear, this bird from Nyeri looks distinctly different to examples of zenkeri I&#39;ve seen in western Kenya. Has anyone else seen birds that look like this in Kenya or outside of Kenya?<br></div><div><br></div><div>Comments are welcomed and thanks to Bruno for permission to post his photographs.<br></div><div><br></div><div>James<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class="gmail_extra"><br><div class="gmail_quote">On 14 June 2018 at 08:49, James Bradley <a href="mailto:jalopyjamo@gmail.com" target="_blank">jalopyjamo@gmail.com</a> [kenyabirdsnet] <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:kenyabirdsnet-noreply@yahoogroups.com" target="_blank">kenyabirdsnet-noreply@<wbr>yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex">

It is a very stocky and distinctive form (e.g. here: <a href="https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/27915891?__hstc=60209138.6664b72e101df4e7430117c7629881db.1527891696782.1528799900102.1528802046324.19&amp;__hssc=60209138.4.1528802046324&amp;__hsfp=2635097111" target="_blank">https://macaulaylibrary.org/as<wbr>set/27915891?__hstc=60209138.6<wbr>664b72e101df4e7430117c7629881d<wbr>b.1527891696782.1528799900102.<wbr>1528802046324.19&amp;__hssc=602091<wbr>38.4.1528802046324&amp;__hsfp=2635<wbr>097111</a> <br></div><div><br></div><div>or here: <a href="https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/78128391?__hstc=60209138.6664b72e101df4e7430117c7629881db.1527891696782.1528986532765.1528989887566.25&amp;__hssc=60209138.4.1528989887566&amp;__hsfp=2635097111" target="_blank">https://macaulaylibrary.org/as<wbr>set/78128391?__hstc=60209138.6<wbr>664b72e101df4e7430117c7629881d<wbr>b.1527891696782.1528986532765.<wbr>1528989887566.25&amp;__hssc=602091<wbr>38.4.1528989887566&amp;__hsfp=2635<wbr>097111</a></div><div><br></div><div> or here: <a href="https://www.hbw.com/ibc/photo/plain-backed-pipit-anthus-leucophrys/bird-ground-0" target="_blank">https://www.hbw.com/ibc/photo/<wbr>plain-backed-pipit-anthus-leuc<wbr>ophrys/bird-ground-0</a>), and the only subspecies of Plain-backed known to occur in Kenya. Despite regular reports of Plain-backed from Laikipia, I have seen no photos or other evidence of this type in that area.</div><div><br></div><div>Birds being ascribed to Plain-backed from Laikipia seem to be based on individuals such as the one here: <a href="https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/72809611?__hstc=60209138.6664b72e101df4e7430117c7629881db.1527891696782.1528799900102.1528802046324.19&amp;__hssc=60209138.2.1528802046324&amp;__hsfp=2635097111" target="_blank">https://macaulaylibrary.org/as<wbr>set/72809611?__hstc=60209138.6<wbr>664b72e101df4e7430117c7629881d<wbr>b.1527891696782.1528799900102.<wbr>1528802046324.19&amp;__hssc=602091<wbr>38.2.1528802046324&amp;__hsfp=2635<wbr>097111</a>, which is also similar to some Mara birds (e.g.here: <a href="https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/88622291?__hstc=60209138.6664b72e101df4e7430117c7629881db.1527891696782.1528986532765.1528989887566.25&amp;__hssc=60209138.5.1528989887566&amp;__hsfp=2635097111" target="_blank">https://macaulaylibrary.org/as<wbr>set/88622291?__hstc=60209138.6<wbr>664b72e101df4e7430117c7629881d<wbr>b.1527891696782.1528986532765.<wbr>1528989887566.25&amp;__hssc=602091<wbr>38.5.1528989887566&amp;__hsfp=<wbr>2635097111</a>), and currently better treated as Buffy as per the 2009 Kenya checklist. But, these birds do appear different to goodsoni Buffy Pipits (e.g. the attached photos by Simon Carter from Soysambu and by Peter Hellman from Solio), in being slightly darker and lacking warm tones, and they are also not the same as zenkeri Plain-backed.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Is anyone familiar with the type of goodsoni and how it compares with the variety that is seen in Laikipia pipits. Are goodsoni x zenkeri intergrades really what these birds are (as suggested in older litt.) and is such an assignment even possible given the cryptic appearance of these birds. And further can anyone provide an image of a Plain-backed/Buffy type pipit from the Athi basin or plains to the south? The Kenya Bird Atlas attributes Plain-backed (presumably referring to goodsoni in those days) to grass plains south of Mt Kenya and in the Athi area but there does not appear to be any recent information to support this distribution.</div><div><br></div><div>Thoughts and comments appreciated from the pipit gurus out there.</div><div><br></div><div>Good birding,</div><div><br></div><div> James<br></div><div><br>-- <br><div class="m_3922324236129477679m_6726933011072138343m_-1332920914583526605gmail-m_-2066546793503471787gmail-m_8828901289680077723gmail_signature">James Bradley<br>Sidney, BC<br><br></div>
