Morning birders,

On Monday (30th Oct), with Kennedy Sikenykeny, we observed 10 Steppe Eagles
and 3 Lesser Spotted Eagles heading south over the Ngong Hills. It was
entertaining to watch the resident pair of Crowned Eagles displaying
aggressively every time a migrant passed through their territory. One of
the Lesser Spotteds even dived towards the displaying male Crowned Eagle
but stopped short of making contact with it. On the Ngongs we also saw
several Common Buzzards last week Friday and Saturday. We also saw a few
non-raptorial migrants including Eurasian Oriole, Barn Swallow, Common
Swift (numerous), Northern Wheatear and Tree Pipit.
