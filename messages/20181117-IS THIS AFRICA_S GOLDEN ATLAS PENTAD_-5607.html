Dear All,
With the discovery of the Western Reef Egret at Nagalomon Dam last
week whilst in the company of Nigel, Fleur and Jennifer, I said to
them this is a new bird for “Finch Pentad.” This is not the name I
chose, but it was given to it, though I must confess I like the
association, I also live in it which makes it a special area of
interest for me. Much better than just its location number. I then
said to my companions, that it must be quite a good number of species
in this Pentad, just a square nine kilometres (five miles) on all
sides, which is not exactly a large area. I suggested I might try and
work it out, and today I did and was rather taken aback, I knew with
the near three-hundred species I have recorded in our paddock alone
that it would be a goodly sum, and I know that I have personally seen
510 species in Nairobi National Park, however “Finch Pentad” is only a
part of that area, and I was also surprised to see how many common
species have never wandered up from the south-east of the Park.
Now I have seen the figure so far recorded in this tiny part of
Africa, I am feeling competitive, my personal thoughts are that
nowhere on the entire African continent can compete with this southern
section of Nairobi and it would be fun to know of the competitive
pentads in Africa, then after that ….. the world!!! About a half of
the Pentad I have never birded in, it is divided equally between
housing and the Kitengela which probably would be fun to have a good
look at sometime soon as I have totally ignored it in favour of the
Park alongside it. It has a huge potential for producing some
surprises.

So how many species in this five miles by five miles, at present 480!,
and it still has a long way to go.

I have attached a map of the Pentad courtesy of a modified Google, and
a list of the species to date, followed by the species that as yet are
not recorded in its confines. Anyone that can contribute records for
species not here would push us further, but anything outlandish must
be supported by a photograph as that is the way we have gone with the
standard of the equipment and the ease of producing readily
recognisable subjects. Additionally I have attached an NNP outline
showing the western area that is in “Finch Pentad,” which shows the
small percentage it actually represents.


“FINCH PENTAD” SPECIES RECORDED TO DATE.
As with the Nairobi National Park Checklist, I have not included any
of the historical forest species recorded in the Kisembe Forest
section of the Park, if the records were what were claimed, they are
historical records anyway, this includes species like Retz’s
Helmet-shrike, Yellow-bellied Greenbul, or birds that once were
resident and have died out like Anteater Chat. Also many
unsubstantiated dry country birds from the vicinity of the Mbagathi
River have not been included although some have since turned up.
