    <p>With one week to go to the end of the year and 984 pentads (atlas
      squares) covered, a core of dedicated bird atlassers were pushing
      to reach 1,000 pentads atlassed for Kenya by the 31st. <b>The
        1,000th card was submitted at 11.59pm </b>last night...! I was
      able to reach an unmapped pentad on Sunday with John Fanshawe,
      Jaap Gijsbertsen and Kees Barendse - the Sokoke pentad to the
      south-west of Arabuko-Sokoke Forest that includes a thin sliver of
      forest along it's northern boundary and which therefore meant we
      were able to add some forest species such as Little Yellow
      Flycatcher - but it also took us to the stunning views across from
      the very south-western corner of the forest looking west where the
      shambas have a few remnants of forest trees - enough to have an
      Ayre's Hawk Eagle and an unusual date for a Yellowbill. Mosque
      Swallows and Scaly Babblers were also good species to add. Heading
      south and west the steep slopes of the ridge have been utterly
      cleansed of any forest and all that remains is short scrub and
      open ground - 'we'll get Flappet Lark, probably down there' we
      predicted... and sure enough there it was together with Grassland
      Pipits, Cut-throat Finches and a lone Red-backed Shrike. A total
      of 66 species was acceptable for a single bash of c.3 hours in
      what is definitely mostly very degraded habitat....</p>
    <p>The 1,000 pentad mark is a significant milestone to reach for the
      Kenya Bird Map project and a real tribute to the awesome amount of
      hours and effort put in by a relatively small group of birders -
      278 people have contributed data to the atlas since it started and
      in 2018 exactly 100. <br>
    </p>
    <p>4,855 Full Protocol cards have been submitted in total (1,117
      were submitted in 2018 - and there are probably more to come from
      atlassers who have not yet submitted cards that have been
      completed). A Full Protocol card is a full list of species for a
      pentad and are data that can be easily used for some excellent
      analyses to understand changes in distribution, population,
      seasonality etc. - such as the plot below that shows the reporting
      rate for Lesser Striped Swallow across the whole of Kenya by
      five-day periods (pentades - not to be confused with <i>pentads</i>
      which are the five minutes by five minutes atlas squares):<br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="cid:part1.8C0F658D.D391DB18@arocha.org" alt=""
        width="416" height="416"> This suggests that the peak time for
      seeing Lesser Striped Swallows is soon - around February (pentade
      no.1 is 1-5th January) - but that there is a clear movement away
      from Kenya in around October... Similar analyses can be done for
      smaller groups of pentads - e.g. for a single ranch, conservancy
      or National Park - or even down to a single pentad -- so long as
      there are sufficient records for those pentads. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Such results are going to add substantial amounts to our
      understanding of species' occurrence and their current status -
      which has changed drastically since the first bird atlas was
      published in 1989. <br>
    </p>
    <p>The Kenya Bird Map project has been fortunate to receive funding
      from the Cambridge Conservation Initiative (CCI) and the Kenya
      government National Research Fund to be allow us to train up
      African ornithologists in the analysis of atlas data and we shall
      be recruiting scientists for the training that will be happening
      in April with input from scientists within the CCI and the
      University of Cape Town. With 1,000 pentads covered and atlassers
      already back out in the field (there have been Whatsapp messages
      to this effect already this morning!), the data being generated is
      without doubt going to reveal some very interesting results for
      conservation and science. <br>
    </p>
    <p>So a huge <b>THANK YOU </b>to all those 278 Citizen Scientists
      who have contributed to the atlas so far - Team Kenya Bird Map is
      doing an outstanding job and I know many birders have hugely
      enjoyed contributing. The atlas is expanding to the whole of
      Africa this year - with an official launch at the AEWA 7th Session
      of the Meeting of the Parties in Durban in December 2018 - so
      watch this space for further information on this and as the new
      website is launched. The BirdLasser app now operates across the
      world and data can be submitted from any corner of Africa already
      - do sign up and join us in this great project if you haven't
      already!<br>
    </p>
    <p>With best wishes for an excellent 2019...</p>
