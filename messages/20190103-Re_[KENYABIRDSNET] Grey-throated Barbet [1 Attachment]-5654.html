Thanks for sharing this James and Happy New Year in Kakamega? I had no
idea of this change, but at least it is not as stupid a name as the
Brown-and-White Barbet they threw at us when our beautiful Snowy
Barbet, Lybius senex was at last separated. As it is a Kenyan endemic
you would think BirdLife would have the courtesy of contacting the
ornithological body in that country before choosing an abhorrent name
like they did for a really stunning Kenyan endemic of back-garden
Nairobi where for so many it is a daily encounter, and is anyone
really going to call it a Brown-and-White Barbet, talk about
railroading and this time it's not SGR!
Best for now
Brian

*That you identified it as Grey-throated Barbet, but in HBW-Birdlife
Checklist 2 this species was split and in Kenya there is Grey-headed Barbet
(Gymnobucco cinereiceps)*

*We have changed it.*


I am not sure the Kenya Birds Checklist subscribes to this split.  Anyway
here is the picture for the record
