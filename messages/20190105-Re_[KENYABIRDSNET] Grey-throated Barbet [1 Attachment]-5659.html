      <p>Hi Neil and all,<br>
As promised I have attached the description (passed to me by Nigel<br>
Hunter yesterday), of the Grey-headed Barbet Gymnobucco cinereiceps,<br>
presented as a distinct species by BirdLife as opposed to<br>
Grey-throated Barbet G. bonapartei.<br>
<br>
I support the Tobias principal that a bird that is morphologically<br>
different should get recognition, and receive appropriate protection<br>
for the form. I also think that BirdLife are doing a sterling job at<br>
highlighting little recognised forms that deserve our attention.<br>
<br>
Lynx Publications are a private commercial publishing company with<br>
their offices in Spain. They merely act as Editors/Publishers for<br>
BirdLife, and of course as such have no rights to launch new species<br>
onto the planet, and are just printing what they are told to.<br>
<br>
If we now look at this revolutionary new Barbet, that occurs in East<br>
Africa, we must look at the parameters that have been set that lead to<br>
the acceptance by both scientific and interested communities of a<br>
formally described new species. Is there any scientific-backed<br>
evidence, and structural evidence, comparison of bill structure and<br>
size, tarsal length, wing and tail lengths, egg, immature plumages and<br>
moult, vocalisations, nesting habits, and on and on…..    Is there a<br>
formal write up of the species which we can refer to in the reference<br>
to see in detail what the proposition for regarding this as a new<br>
species is, is there an author credited as to the research on the<br>
study…. Was there a study?<br>
<br>
All of these relate to supportive evidence, most of these are<br>
mandatory when writing up a new species to science, and to all of<br>
these the answer is negative, there is no paper, no study, no author,<br>
no genetic evidence etc. No-one in the past hundred years has ever had<br>
a species accepted as novel merely based on a few feather details, and<br>
minor size variation.<br>
<br>
Looking further into the paragraph, items such as different lengths of<br>
nasal tufts, have not even been compared and measured, there is a<br>
broad zone over overlap which is brushed aside, all this is a farce<br>
and makes mockery of the set of procedures that are in place to<br>
prevent cavalier presentation of new species, it could be just as<br>
easily you or I or anyone for that matter following this same route.<br>
No new species should ever be admitted without peer reviewage prior to<br>
formal publication.<br>
<br>
We are very close to publishing the new Kenya Checklist, is anything<br>
going to change for Grey-throated Barbet…. I think not. Are any of the<br>
world checklist authorities going to accept this on the evidence<br>
provided, I hope not.<br>
<br>
There are very many other new species that they have also “launched”<br>
that are in all likelihood forms deserving specific identity and<br>
hopefully all will be followed up with convincing material, but for<br>
this Barbet alone it is all too wishy-washy and unconvincing and there<br>
lies the problem.<br>
<br>
All this may seem harsh, and as I say BirdLife have my support, but<br>
with this they are transgressing the ethical boundaries of species<br>
representation, great for the world listers but is it the road to<br>
complete chaos? With all the necessary evidence for this form provided<br>
and following the correct guidelines, it may well be that they are<br>
right after all, but at present they are not.<br>
<br>
Feel free to comment and give your opinions,<br>
<br>
Best to All<br>
Brian<br>

&gt; I don&#39;t know as it is the first I heard if it. In theory there should<br>
