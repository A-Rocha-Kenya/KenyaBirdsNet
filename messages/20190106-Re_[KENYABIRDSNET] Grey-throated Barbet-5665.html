Dear Michael, Nate, Don and All,
Thanks so much for your comments. Whilst obviously we are concerned
with our own geographical area, it would not surprise me if this same
scenario is not taking place all around the globe. To answer the
comments as they have arrived;

Michael,
Thanks for all the time that you have given into the very detailed
reply, and taking the trouble to make the Tobias Scoring System more
lucid.
The invaluable work that has gone into producing the BirdLife World
Checklist must have been vast, but surely the findings by the
investigators must have been placed in the public domain, but there
are no such references for many of the “new species.”  I feel that
this shortsightedness leads to much of the doubt cast on the validity
of some of their work. This all relates to the necessity of having
stringent guidelines to formalising the announcement of a new species.
By breaking away from tradition (not always a bad thing), it seemed
retrogressive rather than progressive, as we had drifted away from
what we call the “species concept” which is an intangible anyway, and
through the new principals entered an even greyer area. That saying we
have entered into the era of “shocking revelation” where outrageous
disarrangements of our way of thinking about the taxonomic
classifications don’t in fact shock us anymore!

I think most of us appreciate that the production of the checklist was
intended as a work in progress and not as a fait accompli, but I
cannot help but feel that the forms being elevated to species level,
would not have been better served as “probable species following
further study” rather than jumping in with a new system that had no
genetic backing, and expecting the world to unite and follow it. Had
the suggestions of the new taxa not been set in stone with a probably
misinterpreted arrogance by the birding public at large, then in all
possibility it might have ignited people to become involved to prove
that the Tobias concept did in fact prevail. I am a morphologist
first, and believe that genetic analysis partners to give a near
complete story, but not the morphology standing alone, nor the
laboratory work standing alone either.

I fully understand what you are saying about how taxonomy has evolved,
initially everything was described as a species, then before there was
anything more than morphological data available many forms got lumped
together as belonging to the same species, it is just in the last few
decades that we (at least in East Africa) have been re-examining the
forms and through genetic markers have found that they represent novel
species after all and are reinstating the original stand alone species
status, and in this regard there is still much to come. But what I
think we are realising that the most convincing results are
morphological/genetic analyses. I can’t agree with any genetic
information being excluded so that it levels the playing field for all
birds for that same reason, and believe that if there was such
existing genetic data it should have been integral to the result. It’s
a bit like acknowledging if we do it this way we will get one set of
results but if we do it the other we might get a different set of
results, so for me the only really level playing field is the
combination of the two methodologies.

I want to see BirdLife triumph in uniting the various factions towards
a unified agreement regarding the bird species on the planet, but I
don’t think this will be possible until genetic assessment comes into
the equation, so that the propositions are more solid and convincing.

Nate,
Here in Africa we have regions with regards to which authority we
follow, East Africa and Horn of Africa is unified, Southern Africa is
unified, and West Africa is unified but Africa isn’t completely, and
it would be true to say that there is no overseeing body that is
actively uniting the continent. There has been much progress with
acceptance of both Common and Scientific names and we are fairly much
all speaking the same language ornithologically. However each country
is autonomous when it comes to the preparation of its country
Checklist, and there lies the problem regarding which authority to
follow.
As a country Kenya is very supportive of BirdLife, and just how much
it helps us to protect our birds and habitat, but when it comes to the
BirdLife list the tendency is not to accept these changes at species
level without seeing a peer reviewed paper first. I have no idea how
the different countries on the continent are variously facing the same
situation, perhaps Michael has some inkling here.
What you must remember is that Africa is a vast region and very much
unlike Europe and North America, and with maybe the exception of RSA
there are not more than a few Professional Ornithologists in any of
the remaining countries, and to get groups of Professional
Ornithogists to come together as a committee to sort out taxonomic
issues usually has to involve outside assistance.

Don,
I agree with all you stated,

Best for now
Brian
