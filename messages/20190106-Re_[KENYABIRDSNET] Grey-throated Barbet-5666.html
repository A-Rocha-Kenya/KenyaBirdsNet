      <p>Dear Michael, Nate, Don and All,<br>
Thanks so much for your comments. Whilst obviously we are concerned<br>
with our own geographical area, it would not surprise me if this same<br>
scenario is not taking place all around the globe. To answer the<br>
comments as they have arrived;<br>
<br>
Michael,<br>
Thanks for all the time that you have given into the very detailed<br>
reply, and taking the trouble to make the Tobias Scoring System more<br>
lucid.<br>
The invaluable work that has gone into producing the BirdLife World<br>
Checklist must have been vast, but surely the findings by the<br>
investigators must have been placed in the public domain, but there<br>
are no such references for many of the “new species.”  I feel that<br>
this shortsightedness leads to much of the doubt cast on the validity<br>
of some of their work. This all relates to the necessity of having<br>
stringent guidelines to formalising the announcement of a new species.<br>
By breaking away from tradition (not always a bad thing), it seemed<br>
retrogressive rather than progressive, as we had drifted away from<br>
what we call the “species concept” which is an intangible anyway, and<br>
through the new principals entered an even greyer area. That saying we<br>
have entered into the era of “shocking revelation” where outrageous<br>
disarrangements of our way of thinking about the taxonomic<br>
classifications don’t in fact shock us anymore!<br>
<br>
I think most of us appreciate that the production of the checklist was<br>
intended as a work in progress and not as a fait accompli, but I<br>
cannot help but feel that the forms being elevated to species level,<br>
would not have been better served as “probable species following<br>
further study” rather than jumping in with a new system that had no<br>
genetic backing, and expecting the world to unite and follow it. Had<br>
the suggestions of the new taxa not been set in stone with a probably<br>
misinterpreted arrogance by the birding public at large, then in all<br>
possibility it might have ignited people to become involved to prove<br>
that the Tobias concept did in fact prevail. I am a morphologist<br>
first, and believe that genetic analysis partners to give a near<br>
complete story, but not the morphology standing alone, nor the<br>
laboratory work standing alone either.<br>
<br>
I fully understand what you are saying about how taxonomy has evolved,<br>
initially everything was described as a species, then before there was<br>
anything more than morphological data available many forms got lumped<br>
together as belonging to the same species, it is just in the last few<br>
decades that we (at least in East Africa) have been re-examining the<br>
forms and through genetic markers have found that they represent novel<br>
species after all and are reinstating the original stand alone species<br>
status, and in this regard there is still much to come. But what I<br>
think we are realising that the most convincing results are<br>
morphological/genetic analyses. I can’t agree with any genetic<br>
information being excluded so that it levels the playing field for all<br>
birds for that same reason, and believe that if there was such<br>
existing genetic data it should have been integral to the result. It’s<br>
a bit like acknowledging if we do it this way we will get one set of<br>
results but if we do it the other we might get a different set of<br>
results, so for me the only really level playing field is the<br>
combination of the two methodologies.<br>
<br>
I want to see BirdLife triumph in uniting the various factions towards<br>
a unified agreement regarding the bird species on the planet, but I<br>
don’t think this will be possible until genetic assessment comes into<br>
the equation, so that the propositions are more solid and convincing.<br>
<br>
Nate,<br>
Here in Africa we have regions with regards to which authority we<br>
follow, East Africa and Horn of Africa is unified, Southern Africa is<br>
unified, and West Africa is unified but Africa isn’t completely, and<br>
it would be true to say that there is no overseeing body that is<br>
actively uniting the continent. There has been much progress with<br>
acceptance of both Common and Scientific names and we are fairly much<br>
all speaking the same language ornithologically. However each country<br>
is autonomous when it comes to the preparation of its country<br>
Checklist, and there lies the problem regarding which authority to<br>
follow.<br>
As a country Kenya is very supportive of BirdLife, and just how much<br>
it helps us to protect our birds and habitat, but when it comes to the<br>
BirdLife list the tendency is not to accept these changes at species<br>
level without seeing a peer reviewed paper first. I have no idea how<br>
the different countries on the continent are variously facing the same<br>
situation, perhaps Michael has some inkling here.<br>
What you must remember is that Africa is a vast region and very much<br>
unlike Europe and North America, and with maybe the exception of RSA<br>
there are not more than a few Professional Ornithologists in any of<br>
the remaining countries, and to get groups of Professional<br>
Ornithogists to come together as a committee to sort out taxonomic<br>
issues usually has to involve outside assistance.<br>
<br>
Don,<br>
I agree with all you stated,<br>
<br>
Best for now<br>
Brian<br>
