<div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr">Hi everyone,<div><br></div><div>I am somewhat &#39;blown away&#39; by the level of discussion here and very excited by it. </div><div><br></div><div>For some time now, this KenyaBirdsNet group has felt like a slowly stagnating pool, getting ever smaller and less interesting, with Brian&#39;s extensive NNP contributions and Fleur&#39;s record-breaking walk updates the only regular pulses keeping it alive. As Fleur alludes in her email, the future of this group - and so much more - depends on the contributions of Sidney, Washington and all the up-and-coming Kenyan birders, but where are the experienced voices of Moses, Mwangi, Chege, Zachary, Wilson and Edwin on these matters? I would like to encourage all of you to contribute to such discussions because I truly feel that your voices are missing here. This shouldn&#39;t just be a conversation for wazungu - these are YOUR birds! Your perspective is really important and I challenge you to give your opinions on this forum. Nobody expects you to &#39;compete&#39; with the taxonomic experience of Michael and Don (I certainly cannot, that&#39;s for sure) but at least offering your view is so warmly welcomed. Please join in.</div><div><br></div><div>Most of us lead wildly different lives outside of the the EA birding scene (I&#39;m currently a software developer in London, for example) and few have the time to commit to such conversations but, when we do, it is a great learning and sharing experience. </div><div><br></div><div><b>Michael, Brian, Nate and Don</b> - thank you so much for your contributions and insight here, all of which have helped me understand more about the position of Birdlife/ HBW. I think the discussion so far has been helpful in concluding that this is still very much a work in progress. One of the most valuable insights, for me, is that many of these &#39;new species&#39; are in fact &#39;old species&#39; that have already been described, only to be lumped and now reinstated to species level. This in itself raises several new questions;</div><div><br></div><div>1. Does &#39;reinstating&#39; remove the need for a new paper or study entirely, or does work still need to be done? </div><div>2. The scientific name of such a &#39;new-old species&#39; is recorded in history and, therefore, has precedence over any new name but what happens if that name is already in use? </div><div>3. Where a form has been formally described previously, such as Ruvu Weaver <i>Ploceus holoxanthus</i>, is it fair game to be treated as a species within a new field guide (e.g. that of Brian and I) even if it is not yet treated as such by Birdlife/ HBW? We&#39;ll be treating it as a species regardless but it is good to get an idea of the issues that this creates.</div><div><br></div><div>Any guidance of these questions will be greatly appreciated.</div><div><br></div><div>I would also like to point out that the Birdlife/ HBW team are not solely about splitting for the sake of splitting. In some cases, they have been quite reluctant to do so, such as in the case of Willard&#39;s Sooty Boubou, a newly-described form from the Albertine Rift, that Birdlife/ HBW have lumped with Mountain Sooty Boubou from West Africa (This is not to be confused with Mountain Black Boubou [as we know it from Stevenson &amp; Fanshawe] which has been renamed as Albertine Sooty Boubou).</div><div><br></div><div>Very best to all,</div><div>Adam</div><div><br></div><div>p.s. an apology from me re: my previous response. It appears that Google autosave didn&#39;t save a change as I had expected. So here is the once-truncated sentence from me all put back together again.</div><div><font color="#3d85c6">With the studies that Alex Kirschel has done on Tinkerbirds, for example, the extensive field research is combined with mDNA to produce a worthwhile reason for the split.</font><br></div><div><br></div></div></div></div></div></div><br><div class="gmail_quote"><div dir="ltr">On Sun, 6 Jan 2019 at 10:02, Brian Finch &lt;<a href="mailto:birdfinch@gmail.com" target="_blank">birdfinch@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br></div><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left-width:1px;border-left-style:solid;border-left-color:rgb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex">Dear Michael, Nate, Don and All,<br>
Thanks so much for your comments. Whilst obviously we are concerned<br>
with our own geographical area, it would not surprise me if this same<br>
scenario is not taking place all around the globe. To answer the<br>
comments as they have arrived;<br>
<br>
Michael,<br>
Thanks for all the time that you have given into the very detailed<br>
reply, and taking the trouble to make the Tobias Scoring System more<br>
lucid.<br>
The invaluable work that has gone into producing the BirdLife World<br>
Checklist must have been vast, but surely the findings by the<br>
investigators must have been placed in the public domain, but there<br>
are no such references for many of the “new species.”  I feel that<br>
this shortsightedness leads to much of the doubt cast on the validity<br>
of some of their work. This all relates to the necessity of having<br>
stringent guidelines to formalising the announcement of a new species.<br>
By breaking away from tradition (not always a bad thing), it seemed<br>
retrogressive rather than progressive, as we had drifted away from<br>
what we call the “species concept” which is an intangible anyway, and<br>
through the new principals entered an even greyer area. That saying we<br>
have entered into the era of “shocking revelation” where outrageous<br>
disarrangements of our way of thinking about the taxonomic<br>
classifications don’t in fact shock us anymore!<br>
<br>
I think most of us appreciate that the production of the checklist was<br>
intended as a work in progress and not as a fait accompli, but I<br>
cannot help but feel that the forms being elevated to species level,<br>
would not have been better served as “probable species following<br>
further study” rather than jumping in with a new system that had no<br>
genetic backing, and expecting the world to unite and follow it. Had<br>
the suggestions of the new taxa not been set in stone with a probably<br>
misinterpreted arrogance by the birding public at large, then in all<br>
possibility it might have ignited people to become involved to prove<br>
that the Tobias concept did in fact prevail. I am a morphologist<br>
first, and believe that genetic analysis partners to give a near<br>
complete story, but not the morphology standing alone, nor the<br>
laboratory work standing alone either.<br>
<br>
I fully understand what you are saying about how taxonomy has evolved,<br>
initially everything was described as a species, then before there was<br>
anything more than morphological data available many forms got lumped<br>
together as belonging to the same species, it is just in the last few<br>
decades that we (at least in East Africa) have been re-examining the<br>
forms and through genetic markers have found that they represent novel<br>
species after all and are reinstating the original stand alone species<br>
status, and in this regard there is still much to come. But what I<br>
think we are realising that the most convincing results are<br>
morphological/genetic analyses. I can’t agree with any genetic<br>
information being excluded so that it levels the playing field for all<br>
birds for that same reason, and believe that if there was such<br>
existing genetic data it should have been integral to the result. It’s<br>
a bit like acknowledging if we do it this way we will get one set of<br>
results but if we do it the other we might get a different set of<br>
results, so for me the only really level playing field is the<br>
combination of the two methodologies.<br>
<br>
I want to see BirdLife triumph in uniting the various factions towards<br>
a unified agreement regarding the bird species on the planet, but I<br>
don’t think this will be possible until genetic assessment comes into<br>
the equation, so that the propositions are more solid and convincing.<br>
<br>
Nate,<br>
Here in Africa we have regions with regards to which authority we<br>
follow, East Africa and Horn of Africa is unified, Southern Africa is<br>
unified, and West Africa is unified but Africa isn’t completely, and<br>
it would be true to say that there is no overseeing body that is<br>
actively uniting the continent. There has been much progress with<br>
acceptance of both Common and Scientific names and we are fairly much<br>
all speaking the same language ornithologically. However each country<br>
is autonomous when it comes to the preparation of its country<br>
Checklist, and there lies the problem regarding which authority to<br>
follow.<br>
As a country Kenya is very supportive of BirdLife, and just how much<br>
it helps us to protect our birds and habitat, but when it comes to the<br>
BirdLife list the tendency is not to accept these changes at species<br>
level without seeing a peer reviewed paper first. I have no idea how<br>
the different countries on the continent are variously facing the same<br>
situation, perhaps Michael has some inkling here.<br>
What you must remember is that Africa is a vast region and very much<br>
unlike Europe and North America, and with maybe the exception of RSA<br>
there are not more than a few Professional Ornithologists in any of<br>
the remaining countries, and to get groups of Professional<br>
Ornithogists to come together as a committee to sort out taxonomic<br>
issues usually has to involve outside assistance.<br>
<br>
Don,<br>
I agree with all you stated,<br>
<br>
Best for now<br>
Brian<br>
