Hi Shailesh,
The genus Anthene (hairtails because most have six projections on the
rear of the hindwing) are a difficult group, at a glance it looks like
you have A indefinita female above and male below,
Best for now

Hi Shailesh!

GREAT to hear you've been photographing butterflies!

The very BEST thing to do with your images is to upload them to the
Virtual Museum - a sister project to the Kenya Bird Map and the data for
which is openly shared with anyone who wants to use it. The Lepidoptera
Society for Africa (LepSoc), uses the VM as a basis for depositing
'specimens' (in the form of a digital image) and there are recognised
experts who go through and identify photographs that people submit for
them.

This way your images are going to be kept for ever as an historical
record of that species at that place and time and will contribute to
building up our knowledge of butterfly distribution and status.

If you need help in how to upload, there are help documents on the site.
It's a bit slow to start with, but once you're used to it, it's very
straight forward.

Best,

Colin

Hello,

While in Nairobi for 3 weeks in January 2019, I took lots of wildlife
photographic. For the next few weeks, I will be posted photos where I
need your help to id them.

The photos are taken within Nairobi. Please have a look at the
attachments and tell me what is as follows:

Photo 1.
Photo 2.

I don't know if photo 1 and 2 is the same species or not.

More to come later.
