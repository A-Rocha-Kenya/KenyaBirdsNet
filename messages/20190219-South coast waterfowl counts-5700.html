<div dir="auto"><p dir="ltr">Greetings everyone</p><p dir="ltr">South coast waterfowl counts were conducted on Sunday 17th Feb. We started our day at a swamp behind kenya bixa in Tiwi, we had a great number of pygmy geese and little grebe, a new record for me in South coast was white-backed duck and garganey(pictures attached), also seen were intermediate egret, grey, purple and great white egret. Interesting land birds were northern wheatear and black-collared barbet. We then went to Mkurumudzi river estuary, which is like a second mida creek, lots of crab plovers(picture attached), many small waders, lots of reed cormorants, a big roost of terns and gulls and a good number of Palm-nut vultures(8)! The days only osprey was seen at KISCOL DAM with 2 African darters and a couple of reed cormorants and cattle egret. We finished the day with the KISCOL swamp, seeing lots of openbill storks, again many pygmy geese, some African jacana, two purple heron and the days only black crake and pied kingfisher. Reed cormorants, black headed herons and cattle egrets were also seen roosting in the reeds. Also attached is a spreadsheet picture of the counts. In the end we managed to log around 120 species in 2 full protocols and 3 adhocs.<br></p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr">Mustafa Adamjee</p></div>
