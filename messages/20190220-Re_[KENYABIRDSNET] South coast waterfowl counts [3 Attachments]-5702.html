Wow Mustafa,
That is very impressive, I honestly did not know that there were so
many interesting areas on the south coast that I was never aware of.
Very interesting and thanks for sharing,
Brian

Greetings everyone

South coast waterfowl counts were conducted on Sunday 17th Feb. We started
our day at a swamp behind kenya bixa in Tiwi, we had a great number of
pygmy geese and little grebe, a new record for me in South coast was
white-backed duck and garganey(pictures attached), also seen were
intermediate egret, grey, purple and great white egret. Interesting land
birds were northern wheatear and black-collared barbet. We then went to
Mkurumudzi river estuary, which is like a second mida creek, lots of crab
plovers(picture attached), many small waders, lots of reed cormorants, a
big roost of terns and gulls and a good number of Palm-nut vultures(8)! The
days only osprey was seen at KISCOL DAM with 2 African darters and a couple
of reed cormorants and cattle egret. We finished the day with the KISCOL
swamp, seeing lots of openbill storks, again many pygmy geese, some African
jacana, two purple heron and the days only black crake and pied kingfisher.
Reed cormorants, black headed herons and cattle egrets were also seen
roosting in the reeds. Also attached is a spreadsheet picture of the
counts. In the end we managed to log around 120 species in 2 full protocols
and 3 adhocs.
