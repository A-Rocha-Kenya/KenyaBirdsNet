Dear Wamiti,
Pay special respect to the Ol' Bolossat hippos,I had a friends son
killed there by one some years back, don't take any chances!
Spoonbills should soon be nesting at Nagalomon Dam in NNP.
Best for now
Brian

Dear Birders,

I have to have observed 3 African Spoonbills on nests yesterday,
20-Feb-2019 at Lake Ol' Bolossat. The nest is a heap of reeds (*Phragmites
sp.*) raised for nearly 12 inches or thereabout above water. They were
about 10-20 meters apart. There was a flock of about 50 other spoonbills
around the nesting birds.

I had plans to access the nesting area (wading through) for other research
interests that would have given me an opportunity to see contents but a
male Hippopotamus occupying this area showed up feeding as early as 15:00
hrs. Would you have proceeded?

I hadn't seen these birds nest before - nature of habitat, nesting
material, associates etc. I guess there is one more nesting site within the
Lake.

I though it might be of some interest for some of you too.

Wamiti.
