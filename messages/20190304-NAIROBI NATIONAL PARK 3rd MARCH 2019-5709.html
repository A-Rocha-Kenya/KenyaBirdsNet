NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 3rd MARCH 2019

Dear All,
At 6.15am I met up with David Guanieri who has just spent a week back
in Kenya in the west, and Ben Mugambi who was with him. Being Sunday
there was no traffic on Magadi or Langata Roads, and we arrived at
Main Gate at 6.30am. I was still night time and the sun was not yet
above the horizon. The drought had continued and there was no recent
rain. Sunday is a busy day, but it also coincided with the Game Count,
there were many people being processed for entry and the queue was out
the door, but in ten minutes we were done and entering the Park. It
was still dark when we drove along the entry road, an African Goshawk
was clicking by the road and nothing was calling.

Our first stop was Ivory Burning Site, and little was to be seen or
heard, nothing at the Mokoyeti Bridge and Nagalomon Dam was at a low
ebb. We had one African Spoonbill, a Great Egret, seven Darters, we
heard a Green and there were two Wood Sandpipers, two Common Snipe and
four Black-winged Stilts. A Nightingale was singing from the scrub, as
was a Zanzibar Greenbul, a surprise for the time of year was a female
Violet-backed Starling. There were small gatherings of Barn Swallows
here and at many dams, but hardly any over the plains.</pre></div></body>
