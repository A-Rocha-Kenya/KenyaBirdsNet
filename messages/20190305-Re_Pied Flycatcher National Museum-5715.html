Thanks very much Peter,
Very nice collection, it's strange that in light and in shade it
appears as two different birds, I have noticed this with other images
taken of it. It's a very happy bird, from images you cannot see, but
when I videoed it last week it can be seen to be singing! You won't
have been aware of this but there were three on Mt Elgon ten days ago
seen and photographed by David Guanieri and Ben Mugambi, and
Washington had one in Kakamega. Last year Kakamega also had three, all
photographed. It now seems to be a regular migrant to western Kenya
now end Feb/early March, but it is difficult to believe that since the
original as you say 54 years ago it has been overlooked. All five
records are included in the next batch for the East African Rarities
Committee and following acceptance it loses its rarity status. But who
would ever have imagined in their wildest dreams that one would
venture east of the Rift! Now we want a nice male Collared!
Best for now
Brian

Some excitement in the bird world this week. A European Pied Flycatcher was
spotted in the Kenya Museum grounds. This is the first recorded sighting in
Kenya in 54 years, of this migratory bird. I took a few images of this shy
and restless bird that remained distant from the camera throughout.
Thanks to Peter Murithi of Nature Kenya, these pictures were possible. His
sharp eyes and camera support resulted in nine usable pictures out of the
64 images taken.
