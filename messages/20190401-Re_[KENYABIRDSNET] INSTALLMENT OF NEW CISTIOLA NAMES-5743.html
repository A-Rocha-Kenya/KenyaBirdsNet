      <p>Dear All,<br>
As expected the Union for Uniformity in Nomenclature have produced the<br>
awaited new common names list for the Cisticolas, what are peoples<br>
feelings about adopting the recommended these new names?<br>
<br>
RECCOMMENDATIONS OF THE UNION FOR UNIFORMITY IN NOMENCLATURE<br>
Occasional Paper from the Committee of the U.U.N. No. 17 Cisticolas<br>
<br>
The committee for the UUN has met a number of times and considered the<br>
poor choice of names surrounding the Cisticolas in Africa, and has<br>
voted on the change of the names to those more appropriate.<br>
<br>
As there was only one species uniquely found outside the Afrotropical<br>
region, the Golden-headed Cisticola, the vote was unanimous, this is a<br>
perfect name showing its unique golden crown and remained unchallenged<br>
and unchanged.<br>
<br>
Now we come to the African Cisticolas, and start with the plain-backed<br>
group and the committee finally agreed on the following;<br>
<br>
Singing Cisticola is an appalling name the bird has no musical<br>
qualities and the most fitting name is the Sneezing Cisticola on<br>
account of the many calls that sound like a sneeze, Richard Cisticola<br>
was also tabled as it is another call frequently given, but the<br>
majority ruled in favour of Sneezing.<br>
<br>
Red-faced Cisticola is a simple transition to the name of Orange-faced<br>
Cisticola as this is the colour involved, not red.<br>
<br>
Whistling Cisticola is a poor name as the bird actually siffles but<br>
wisely this name was not opted for as a species which will no longer<br>
bear that name after this paper is adopted, already exists. The calls<br>
are rising and descending cadences depending on the location and the<br>
name Escalator Cisticola was agreed on unanimously.<br>
<br>
Trilling Cisticola is not a trill and the name chosen to replace this<br>
is Vibrato Cisticola.<br>
<br>
Rock Cisticola also goes into bushes as well as bounding on boulders<br>
so it might not always be found on rocks so requires a qualifying name<br>
and we chose Rock-preferring Cisticola.<br>
<br>
Chubb’s Cisticola  is nearly well named in that it is rather a plump<br>
bird and we chose Chubby Cisticola.<br>
<br>
Hunter’s Cisticola is a patronym which does not assist with the<br>
identification, from now on it will be Undulating Cisticola because of<br>
the wavering call.<br>
<br>
Now we come to the small short-tailed grassland species.<br>
<br>
Desert Cisticola is an atrocious name as it is found in many grassy<br>
habitats up into higher altitudes than the desert is found. It is<br>
probably the most widespread species and we have selected Universal<br>
Cisticola.<br>
<br>
Wing-snapping Cisticola is more often heard than seen and because of<br>
the difficulties in observing the bird we have opted for Invisible<br>
Cisticola.<br>
<br>
Zitting Cisticola is very widespread outside of the African region and<br>
the name will be Common Cisticola.<br>
<br>
Pectoral-patch Cisticola is not changing, the name is perfect as it is<br>
and we only change the name if it is an improvement.<br>
<br>
Black-backed Cisticola has a very distinctive chestnut-cap in the<br>
breeding male, and is very attractive. It also has a unique pale<br>
collar in birds in all plumages which is why Crescent-naped Cisticola<br>
was thought a good alternative.<br>
<br>
The small Cisticolas with plainer backs have been rearranged as follows;<br>
<br>
The word Siffling as in Siffling Cisticola is archaic and refers to<br>
the whistle that an old-fashioned whistling-kettle made when the water<br>
has boiled and the gas turned down. As this word is not used any more<br>
your Committee decided on Kettle Cisticola.<br>
<br>
Tiny Cisticola is small but not many cisticolas are Tiny, keeping with<br>
its latin name nana which comes from a French word for Dwarf we<br>
decided that it would be wrong not to maintain the French Connection<br>
and have simply chosen Petite Cisticola.<br>
<br>
Foxy Cisticola is a name we do not like as we have never noticed that<br>
they are sly nor steal chickens. But the call is repeated piping thus<br>
the name Picolo Cisticola was the suggestion that garnered the most<br>
votes.<br>
<br>
Long-tailed Cisticola is an appropriate name but not as good as the<br>
one you are going to use in future which is Prinia Cisticola.<br>
<br>
The streaky sometimes reddish-winged group;<br>
<br>
The Winding Cisticola uniquely calls “A,B,C,D” and the name that seems<br>
logical for this species from henceforth is Alphabet Cisticola.<br>
<br>
The Stout Cisticola has a unique habit after breeding shared by no<br>
other congeners, they gather in post-breeding groups. We chose<br>
Flocking Cisticola as we have already heard this name being used<br>
commonly by visitors from outside of Africa, “What’s that, oh it’s<br>
just a bunch of Flocking Cisticolas.”<br>
<br>
Please make the necessary amendments to your countries Bird Checklists.<br>
<br>
The Committee will issue another directive of change which will be<br>
published on 1st April 2020.<br>
<br>
Part two is to follow after the Committees rehabilitation……...<br>
