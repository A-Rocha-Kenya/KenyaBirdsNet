Hi Marco,
Melanism in small hawks makes life difficult for us. There are four
considerations, African Goshawk, Great Sparrowhawk, Ovampo Sparrowhawk
and Gabar Goshawk.

African Goshawk only has three dark bands on the tail, seen from below
the tail almost looks unbanded as the bands do not reach the underside
of the outer retrices.

Great Sparrowhawk is very large and your bird is quite delicate.

Ovampo and Gabar are the two to consider and it can be very difficult.
Both have black rumps and barred tails, in full adults cere and legs
are red, although this bird has very little colour on cere or legs.
But even disregarding rarity with Ovampo being very rare and dark
birds exponentially rarer, and Gabar being quite common and dark phase
merely less common… the Ovampo is quite stouter, the bill markedly
larger, and the Gabar slender with proportionately weak bill. From
side view the bill is a continuation from the curve of the crown in
Ovampo, there is no marked step. In you bird the bill and crown are
not a continuous curve, and there is a marked step on the forehead
because the bill is small and that is why I believe this is a Gabar,
Best for now
Brian

Expert judgement needed!




What do we have here?

A dark morph African Goshawk (most likely) or

Dark morph Ovambo Sparrowhawk.

Juv of one of the two.




Isn’t the middle toe rather long?




I took the picture at Lake Jipe




Thanks,

Marco
