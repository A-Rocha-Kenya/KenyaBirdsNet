Hi Brian,

I am following the conversation with interest. I was in Naivasha in February
2018 and took some photos of what I Iisted as LBBG. Please have a look and
let me know if you think they might be something different. List link
below:

Would be great to get YLG in Kenya but I hope they don’t spread there like
they are here in Rome!

Thanks,

David

Hi Shailesh,
Thanks for stressing that we take an interest in the large gulls we
see in East Africa. I currently have four nominate Caspian Gull
records in with the East African Rarities Committee awaiting
consideration, one Kenyan and three Ugandan. But also have another
half-dozen records to submit later that may involve Steppe and
Yellow-legged Gulls. For the people that went to see the Caspian Tern
at Lake Naivasha in May 2018, and saw a larger and paler-backed gull
with the Baltic (Lesser Black-backed Gulls) images of this bird have
been sent to Klaus Malling Olsen who authored the gull book you are
referring to, and his response was that this can only be a
Yellow-legged Gull!
Best for now
Brian

Hello,There was anemail which Brian Finch wrote about the large gulls
seen
in Kenya. It isimportant to look at the gull species very carefully
especially the large ones.Here in the UK, we the birders are always
looking
for rare or uncommon gull/swhich can either be with a flock of other
gull
species..There is nowa separate large gull species from the Lesser
Black-backed Gull.Lesser Black-backed Gull Larus fuscus is now called
Baltic
Gull Larus fuscusLesser Black-backed Gull Larus(fuscus)
intermedius/graellsii. Ssp. graellsii found in W.Europe, Iceland and
Britain
and hasslate-grey back.Is there any slighting of Heuglin’s Gull
