Hi Adam and Shailesh,
This is weird, I was comparing your gull from several years back
today, with the May 2018 and was thinking, this could actually be the
same bird returning.  Gulls are creatures of habit, look at all the
Ring-bills in UK. It's worth following up.

In answer to Shailesh's question Caspian, Steppe and Yellow-legged
would all be new not just for East Africa, but all subsaharan Africa.
With the new taxonomy we have lost nominate Lesser Black-backed Gull
for Baltic Gull but until there are new studies, still have Lesser
Black-backed in the form of Heuglin's.

Best for now
Brian

Hi Adam,
Large gulls are difficult to id them if they look very similar to other
large gull. The photo you took the one in flight looks like a YLG and you
need to see how much black it is got from P10-P5.
Do you have Klaus Malling Olsen email address? And, if you do please send
your images to him. He will tell you what gull it is.
If the YLG is confirmed, is it going to be new for Kenya.

Hi Brian, Shaliesh et al.,
Your 'Yellow-legged' Gull appears identical to my Naivasha gull Brian (from
2013 I think?), so I wonder why the 'experts' did not suggest that my bird
was a YLG?
Can you see any visible difference from these images?
CheersAdam

    Hi Shailesh,
Thanks for stressing that we take an interest in the large gulls we
see in East Africa. I currently have four nominate Caspian Gull
records in with the East African Rarities Committee awaiting
consideration, one Kenyan and three Ugandan. But also have another
half-dozen records to submit later that may involve Steppe and
Yellow-legged Gulls. For the people that went to see the Caspian Tern
at Lake Naivasha in May 2018, and saw a larger and paler-backed gull
with the Baltic (Lesser Black-backed Gulls) images of this bird have
been sent to Klaus Malling Olsen who authored the gull book you are
referring to, and his response was that this can only be a
Yellow-legged Gull!
Best for now
Brian

Hello,There was anemail which Brian Finch wrote about the large gulls
seen
in Kenya. It isimportant to look at the gull species very carefully
especially the large ones.Here in the UK, we the birders are always
looking
for rare or uncommon gull/swhich can either be with a flock of other gull
species..There is nowa separate large gull species from the Lesser
Black-backed Gull.Lesser Black-backed Gull Larus fuscus is now called
Baltic
Gull Larus fuscusLesser Black-backed Gull Larus(fuscus)
intermedius/graellsii. Ssp. graellsii found in W.Europe, Iceland and
Britain
and hasslate-grey back.Is there any slighting of Heuglinâ€™s Gull Larus.h.
