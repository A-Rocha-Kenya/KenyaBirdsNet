Greetings birders

The record for the number of birds seen on a Nature Kenya’s Wednesday Morning Birdwalk has been broken again – and again at Paradise Lost and environs in Kiambu! Well, to tell the truth, we were birding until nearly 1 pm.

The day started with rain and flying termites everywhere. By the time we turned off Kiambu Road towards Paradise Lost the rain had stopped and the birds came out to feast on the fallen termites, giving us stunning views of birds feeding on the ground and a Brown-backed Woodpecker flycatching!

Northern migrants included Common Sandpiper, Eurasian Nightjar, Red-backed Shrike, Lesser Grey Shrike, Isabelline (Red-tailed) Shrike, Willow Warbler, Common Whitethroat, Common Nightingale, Spotted Flycatcher, Tree Pipit.

Intra-African migrants included African Open-billed Stork, Grey-headed Kingfisher and Chestnut Weaver. 

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
