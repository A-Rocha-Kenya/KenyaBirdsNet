Thanks very much for this Patrick,
I have a photograph of what likes Lygodactylus capensis that was on
our garden gate, I can try and locate it for you if you wish. A
atricollis is widespread and common in NNP and we have them in our
paddock.
The chameleon seems to be the first from actually inside NNP, though
recorded from the immediate surrounds both above (Carnivore) and below
the Park (Emakoko, Ololo both south of the river).
Very best
Brian

Thanks Brian  for this record. It's expected as they are also present in
Mlolongo  area which is not far from NNP.  Here they are sympatric
Lygodactylus  cf capensis,  Hemidactylus angulatus and H. mabouia,
Acanthocercus atricollis minutus just to a few.

Dear All,
In the last report for NNP, I mentioned that we had found a pair of
Side-striped Chameleons Trioceros bitaeniatus on the Ololo track, it
was a new reptile in the Park for me, and I had never actually heard
of them being found in NNP before. There were so many birds on the
montage and not enough room for the chameleons! Here are images on
abundantly flowering Asparagus racemosus,
Best to all
Brian
