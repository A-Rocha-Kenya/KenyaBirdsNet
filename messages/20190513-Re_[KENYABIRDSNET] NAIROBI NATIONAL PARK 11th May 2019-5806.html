Dear All,
After posting the report for 11th May, I quickly received a reply from
Hatton Stratfield….
“Do you have any more images of your Wahlberg's Eagle? I believe the
picture you sent is of a dark Tawny. The feet look quite heavy and the
bill IMO is very strong. We are now studying Wahlberg's in the Mara
and I spend a great deal of time both observing them in the field and
handling them. “

Hi Stratton,
Having blown up Washington's image, though I haven't got a full res
that he took, the bill is too deep for a Wahlberg's, also the dome to
the head profile more continuous. I have to go along with a Tawny, but
there are some strange things on this individual, the bill appears
pale with only the tip blackish, but as this was against a low setting
sun, I believe the almost blue tint is a light distortion and it may
well be yellow. I don't think that the legs do look powerful in this
image or the trousers very extensive, the suggestion of the elongation
of the nape feathers is just feather ruffle, and the whole bird looks
a bit dis-shevelled which might also account for the illusion of a
flat crown and a fairly slim appearance.  But you are perfectly
correct, there is no denying the bill and this is a Tawny and not a
Wahlberg's and just goes to show the importance that any interesting
observations must be backed with images. I am sad that I have lost my
first Wahlberg's in NNP, but delighted that it shows that no matter
who has an observation of an unusual bird like this might have been,
that any observations have to be supported by photographic evidence
that can be readily accepted  as the claimed species, by others. It
reduces Wahlberg's Eagle in NNP back to unsupported sight records
only.
Thanks for pointing this out so quickly, any idea on the terrestrial Peregrine?
Very best
Brian
