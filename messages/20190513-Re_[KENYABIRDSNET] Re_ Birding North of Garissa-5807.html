Thanks so much for all this Chege,
Can I use your images as a back up for the nominate Somali Sparrow
submission? I must admit that I too noticed that the tail of the Wild
Cat was extraordinarily long and took the liberty of forwarding it to
Tom Butynski who has all of the mammal people contacts that exist and
was sure it would be of interest to them.

Back to Somali Sparrows, it certainly looks now like we have been
quietly invaded!

Very best and will let you know as soon as anything comes concerning the cat,
Brian

Dear Brian, Itai, Don James, Darcy and all

Thank you for your notes, comments and concern about the species and do
appreciate that you all enjoyed reading the notes.



I checked my notes too on safaris I did with clients to the area and we had
no records of Somali Sparrows. Now I think I should have photographed all in
each centre but while at this trading centres I did avoid using camera.
However I tried my best to photographed some individual for the record on
one trading centre before Mado Gashe.



Looking at the Somali Sparrow on a whole dimension I dag out some old photos
from different places I have seen them. I could find more if only I was well
organized with my photo filing. So Im still missing some good shots that I
can remember taking.



Anyway on the attached photo

“A” marked photos are of 1 individual male bird from North of Garissa. Birds
marked “B” are a single bird in different angle on the same trading centre.
Female B was together with individual male B. I put the head part because I
would have thought individual A might be hybrid though having more chestnut
head than the 2 photos  (photo 2&amp;3) of hybrid birds in Turbi (middle left).
But looking at the bird North of Garissa “A”I would question myself what are
the crown feather colors when molting from an immature bird to subadult and
subadult to adult? May be the bird North of Garissa A that I think and call
it hybrid is just another Somali Sparrow molting comparing with photo 2&amp;3.



I also dag out my yellow birds from Kapedo that I have always called
breeding males because the illustration on Stevenson saying breeding male.
So naturally that made me think others were non breeding males when yellow
was absent. I did not photograph but I 90% think I remember a yellow bird on
a bridge north of Marsabit but would have to keep an eye if back there



Then I added the Selempo’s one at the Sala Gate and I added a House Sparrow
they were feeding together on the same flock before flying on the building



Thanks too for looking at my mystery bird. I hope we can know what it was
and can be found again.



Don I really did doubt my cat when I looked at the illustration on the
Kingdon’s field guide. This cat looks thin and elongated than what the
illustration shows but ok the marking of the front legs and the tail do
much.  If there were races then that might be the reason.



James… The mystery birds about 15 to 20km north of junction to Rahole
National Reserve and Mado Gashe



Anyway with all these questions on birds north of Garissa I think it would
be a high time we went back there as a group

Many thanks for now

Chege

Thanks Chege for your most interesting photos.  I’ve never seen or heard of
a Wild Cat with such a long tail - simply amazing.



Your Somali Sparrow records are of particular interest, and I hope you
managed to get some photos, if not could you please post a description with
particular attention to the underparts.



Somali Sparrows in Kenya seem to come in a variety of colours, and hybrids
with House Sparrow seem to becoming more common.



Nominate Somali Sparrow has pale yellow underparts, while the race fulgens
shows much brighter yellow on the belly.



The plain buffy-white underparts of birds from Marsabit south to Isiolo and
Garissa districts may represent an undescribed form ( as mentioned by Van
Someren back in 1932). There is a good selection of them in the Field
Museum, Chicago with a few also in the NMK collection.



Cohen &amp; Mills (2010) “Mystery sparrows in Somaliland”  in Birding Africa
(June 2010) also showed an interesting selection of photos.



Meanwhile I seem to recall some time ago James Bradley showed us all a
photograph I think by Simon Carter along the Galana River of all places
which had pure white underparts.



A review of the Somali Sparrow in Kenya will I’m sure be a very worthwhile
exercise for us all.



Best wishes

Don Turner.
