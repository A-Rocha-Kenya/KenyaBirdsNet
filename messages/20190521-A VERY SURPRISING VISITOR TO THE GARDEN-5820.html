Dear All,
A frustrating visitor was in the garden next door. I heard it three
days ago and thought to myself where has the Ruppell’s Robin Chat now
learnt to mimic Golden-tailed Woodpecker! Late this afternoon it
called from the woodland again, initially I thought it was the RRC
being annoying again, but then the call came from high in the tree,
and then further away high in a tree and by the time I had got myself
organised with IPad, binoculars and camera, I could hear it down the
drive, by the time I was outside I could hear it disappearing into the
distance and although I played a recording it was too distant at that
time. I would imagine it will return as it was very noisy and
obviously looking for a mate, and doing a wide circuit. The only
problem is it chose the time when I was off on a ten day safari and
won’t be here if it does come back! Presumably it is something to do
with the Karen Blixen Museum Gardens and the Ngong Racetrack birds. I
used to live with Golden-tails in the Mara and so the calls are
familiar to me, even if I do think it’s coming from a RRChat! It’s
worth being aware especially for residents of Mukoma and Kisembe
Estates, but might even get into Kisembe Forest in NNP.
Best for now
Brian
