NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 3rd JUNE 2019

Dear All,
On 3rd June, Fleur Ng’Weno and myself arrived at the Main Gate and
were soon inside the Park.
Although there had been some good rains it was overcast but dry this
morning, and fairly chilly. The common species were calling as we
drove to Ivory Burning Site, including the Emerald Cuckoo recorded
last Thursday near the Entrance. IBS was also quiet and we continued
to Nagalomon Dam. Here there were four Yellow-billed Storks around the
edge, but on the island were eight adult Open-billed Storks resting
amongst the breeding Darters, and it was looking like they might soon
join this colony, however a pair seen mating last year did not come to
anything. A few pairs of Long-tailed Cormorants were incubating. Only
one African Spoonbill was incubating but another pair in breeding
condition was present. A bird that was incubating for six weeks
without any results had now given up. A little further around the dam,
only visible from the eastern end, is a tree attracting large numbers
of Sacred Ibis and looks like another colony is about to spring to
life. Amazingly today, although we did not visit Athi Dam, we recorded
no Marabous! The small Great Egret was present around the edge with
the resident African Jacana. On the water was a Red-knobbed Coot, only
the second I have seen on this dam. A Gabar Goshawk flew over the
water, many Yellow-billed Kites were present, and were a common sight
in much of the Park today. The first of several Red-chested and the
first of many Diederic Cuckoos were calling, a couple of Pied
Kingfishers fed around the island, and Speke’s Weavers were nest
building in reeds and around the edges, and were found commonly all
through the Park today, indicating a large incursion into the area.
The only bird singing on the Causeway was a Spotted Morning Thrush.</pre></div></body>
