Greetings birders

It had rained all night. The morning was dark, cloudy and cold. But a hardy group of birders turned out at the Nairobi National Museum for Nature Kenya's Wednesday Morning Birdwalk and went to Karura Forest. 

The first and biggest surprise was a Lesser Flamingo flying over the meadow near the Amani picnic grounds! Karura Forest is not flamingo habitat. But thereâ€™s been a successful flamingo breeding event in Lake Natron, and the young flamingoes are now dispersing across East Africa. Alkaline lakes are not far away as the flamingo flies.

When we crossed the swamp, a Red-chested Flufftail called out to us! We were delighted, but did not have the equipment to call back. Other highlights included Black Cuckooshrike with yellow shoulders (also seen in Langata 3 weeks ago), Brown-chested Alethe, and two Narina Trogon.

Thanks to Friends of Karura Forest, 

Fleur
