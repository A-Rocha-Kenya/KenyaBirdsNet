Hi Ben,
Oh I see. So I identified a Common Snipe of Washington's, I had
assumed the Kingfisher bird had come to the ground as I had not
received any photos of the bird on the bush so only commented on what
was attached.
This leaves a bit of a quandary now as I now fully agree with
Washington that the perched bird is very grey, almost certainly far
too much for a spring plumaged Common Snipe, also there is great
contrast between the cold grey upperparts and the very white
underparts... and I must go with NNP's first documented record of an
African Snipe, and of course a Pentad first... thankyou, it's made it
the 488th for the list, not sure what it is for NNP as it hasn't been
calculated for quite a while.
So I did a fairly thorough search through the literature and on the
net, and nowhere at all can I find that there has been any reference
to an African Snipe perched calling bird like this (whilst normal in
Common Snipe) off the ground. So I am going to ask the South Africans
to comment on this, with your images.
Best for now
Brian

Many thanks for sharing these interesting photos of such unusual birds.
The snipe was no longer around when we looked on Sunday!

Greetings birders,



Thanks Sidney for sharing these exciting records. Below are a few more:



1. On behalf of Ben Allen, Jennifer Oduori and myself, a Common Snipe –
which should be thousands of miles away on its breeding grounds in Northern
Europe and Asia – singing (if repeated, monotonous pip pip pip pip can be
called singing) from an Acacia at the swamp near Kingfisher Picnic site on
23 June 2019. Photo by Ben Allen..









2. On behalf of Peter and Ann Usher and Sukhy and Jaytinder Soin, the fabled
Quail-plover in hiding. Photo by Peter Usher.









3. Finally on June 29, with the Nature Kenya and Dakatcha Woodland
Conservation Group team, we visited Bura oxbow lake and Gandini wetland,
north of River Galana-Sabaki near the town of Garashi. At Bura oxbow lake
there were expanses of white water lilies and thousands of ducks – at least
500 White-faced Whistling Ducks and 500 Fulvous Whistling Ducks, as well as
Spur-winged Geese and Knob-billed Ducks – many African Open-billed Storks,
and a variety of other birds, including Squacco Heron, African Fish Eagle,
Black-winged Stilt, Jacobin Cuckoo, Brown-headed Parrot and Mangrove
Kingfisher.. At the smaller, shallower Gandini wetland, the birds were fewer
but almost entirely different, and included Pink-backed Pelican,
Yellow-billed Stork, Great White Egret, Little Egret, Glossy Ibis and
African Spoonbill. In the forest and bush Black-bellied Starlings gathered
in noisy flocks and we had brief views of gorgeous African Golden Orioles.



Wishing you good birding, Fleur
