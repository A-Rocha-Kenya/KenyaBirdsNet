Thanks Don, Darcy and all,
Interesting that again, the only displays observed were aerial and
from the ground. I am sure that Dr Cecilia would have mentioned any
that called from elevated perches as in the NNP bird, but there just
doesn't seem to be any documentation covering the subject,
Best for now
Brian

Dr Cecilia Gichuki chose the African Snipe for her Doctorate degree.  Here
is a summary of her Thesis:

This thesis gives the results of 34 months (March 1997 to December 1999) of
field study of the African Snipe at Lake Ol' Bolossat (36° 26'E 00° 09'S)
and surrounding highlands. The area is characterised by extensive
destruction of marshes and catchment of the basin. The African Snipe is very
sensitive to habitat destruction and can be a useful indicator of habitat
quality. The aims of the study were to determine population characteristics,
foraging behaviour and factors that influence reproductive success of the
African Snipe. The focal animal-sampling technique and radio-tracking
methods were used to study foraging behaviour and movement of marked and
unmarked birds respectively. The relative age of individuals was determined
from changes in pulmage and body size. The sex of adults was determined from
cloacal examination and DNA analysis. The diet was investigated by observing
foraging birds, analysing faecal material and potential food items collected
at foraging sites. There was a resident population of African Snipes that
bred and foraged in the study area throughout the year which numbered 900 to
1200 birds. The mean population density was 14.7 + 0.17 birds km-2 and the
average sex ratio of 1.24:1 was slightly skewed towards males, especially
early in the breeding season. Whereas most of the snipes (86.7%) occurred in
Lake Ol'Bolossat Basin, a few (14%) were found in upland marshes. The study
has shown that African Snipes are monogamous. Males performed distinctive
aerial and ground displays, defended small breeding territories (&lt;10 ha) and
guarded the nest. The females selected the nest site, built the nest and
incubated the eggs. Nests were in more elevated sites (mean 8.49 + 1.60 cm
above water or ground), which were in shallower water (mean 3.51 + 0.47 cm)
and in denser clumps of grass (mean 26.02 + 0.8 plants/m2) than random
locations. Clutch size ranged from two to four with a mode of three eggs.
The egg-laying dates (Julian Dates) varied significantly among pairs nesting
in stream-marshes, lake-marshes, tall wet grassland and abandoned
cultivation with mixed herbs (F 3,141 = 278, P&lt;0.001). The incubation period
ranged from 19 to 21 days and did not differ between nests built in
different periods and sites. Hatching success ranged from 54 to 69% and
varied significantly between pairs nesting in different periods and habitat
types. The maximum hatching success of 1.98 + 0.14 hatchings per nest
occurred in 1998 while minimum of 1.63 + 0.39 hatchings per nest occurred in
1997. The average fledging success of all pairs during this study was 1.26 +
0.47 fledglings per nest. The overall reproductive success of snipes
breeding in the study area was estimated at 38.2% (146 juveniles/382
hatchlings), indicating that only one out of three chicks hatched survived
to adult age. African Snipes foraged in a wipe range of wet habitats within
a mean home range size of 39.08 + 4.6 ha (n = 7 birds). Its diet mainly
consisted of large invertebrates, particularly annelids (34.4%), crustaceans
(20.7%), insect larvae (17.8%), and molluscs (5.8%). While searching for
food and nest sites, the snipes moved in altitude from the lake basin (2340
m) to as high as Dundori Hills (2700 m).

Recoveries of ringed birds indicated that most of the snipes made localized
movements but a few vacated the study area for extended periods. During this
study, a decline of about 34% of the African Snipe population was estimated
in Kenya.
