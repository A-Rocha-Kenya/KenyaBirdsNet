Hi Jonathan,
I think your Grey Cuckoo-shrike has come down from higher levels like
Aberdares as with a number of elevation migrants escaping from the
cold, but is a great record. However I think you have an even rarer
record for the Nairobi district in that Black Heron. This species has
never been recorded in Nairobi National Park, and the closest I have
seen it is Naivasha where of course it is not a rarity, and Tana
Bridge on the Thika Road where before the floodplains were cultivated
it was regular,
Best for now
Brian

That’s a great find!

Grey Cuckooshrikes were resident in Karura Forest in the past, but I have
not seen one recently. It’s good to know they are still in or near Nairobi!


I wonder whether it came down from highland forest because of the cold
season?

Best wishes, Fleur

Today 4th August 2019 we had an early bird watching me and guest starting
at 6.48 am, the sun raise was so beautiful from our main entrance to the
reception on Acacia tree birds active was so live on the branches, We saw
a Chin - spot Batis  Olive Thrush, Commo Bulbul and 20 lesser striped
swallows on the roof at least 13 sitting and 7 other were flying feeding.
We proceeded to the Forest on the right side of the Jogging truck another
activities of water birds, Sacred Ibis, Great White Egret, Black Egret for
my first time at Windsor and the number of Reed cormorants were higher
than usual at least 42 on the trees Little grebe Yellow Bill Duck African
darta and Grey heron at the lake. As we proceeded to the Forest we had
another chance with feeding party after a walk where I was so challenged
with a bird till I share to my guest that I see a new bird here. First I
thought was White - eyed Slaghty Flycatcher but it’s movement on the tree
was strange, I had to check it again and again, the reason we had fog and
view was not clear. Finally I tracked it till I identified it to be Grey
cuckoo shrike.

Birders is the bird on the transit or is at the Migrating feeding zone
first time at Windsor it is my second time see it, first I saw it at
Arabuko Sokoke Forest mid 2000.
Keep birding
