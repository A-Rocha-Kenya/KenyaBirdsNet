That's an interesting incident Colin, do we know what race? Nothing
will ever beat the Belgians that pulled that Marsh Warbler out of a
net at Ngulia with a ring on it, put there by themselves in Belgium
earlier in the season though!
Best for now

....and, whilst not a long-distance recovery, there was an African Pygmy
Kingfisher that was ringed during work on the Kayas on south coast in
c.1994 by Waiyaki of Ornithology Dept that he then controlled himself in
a different Kaya c.40kms away. Not sure if that ever was reported to the
Scheme, Graeme? Quite probably not. Hopefully as we get to digitising
the ringing data, this will come to light - and others like it.
Actually, if I remember right, Waiyaki didn't realise it was a control
when he caught the ringed bird and it was only when schedules were being
written up much later than it was realised it had been ringed in a
different forest patch!. I forget the details of actual dates and which
kayas were involved - someone at Ornithology could probably hunt them down.

Dear All,

There are three ringing recoveries of Afrotropical kingfishers that I
know of affecting East Africa.

Two Grey-headed, both ringed in Ethiopia by the late John Ash; one
(ringed 16 Oct 1970, 7°36N) was caught by a ringer at Masogo near
Kisumu, Kenya on 19 Nov 1976; the other (ringed 4 Oct 1974, 11°34N)
was found dead at Zombo near Mombasa, Kenya on 1 Mar 1975.

A Pied Kingfisher ringed in Ethiopia, 8°N, 21 Jul 1970 was caught at
Lake Kyogo, Uganda, in Nov 1971.

Cheers,

Graeme
