<div class="moz-text-flowed">I don't believe the details of the race were checked at the time, Brian 
- but I am pretty certain it would be the migratory natalensis - same as 
we have in Watamu. (does the resident race occur on the coast?? not sure 
it does - though Don would be able to tell us, I'm sure...)

<br>There are three ringing recoveries of Afrotropical kingfishers that I
<br>know of affecting East Africa.
<br>
<br>Two Grey-headed, both ringed in Ethiopia by the late John Ash; one
<br>(ringed 16 Oct 1970, 7°36N) was caught by a ringer at Masogo near
<br>Kisumu, Kenya on 19 Nov 1976; the other (ringed 4 Oct 1974, 11°34N)
<br>was found dead at Zombo near Mombasa, Kenya on 1 Mar 1975.
<br>
<br>A Pied Kingfisher ringed in Ethiopia, 8°N, 21 Jul 1970 was caught at
<br>Lake Kyogo, Uganda, in Nov 1971.
<br>
<br>Cheers,
<br>
