NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 9th AUGUST 2019

Dear All,
Nigel Hunter and myself met up with Mustafa Adamjee visiting from
Lunga Lunga on the south coast, at the Main Gate to Nairobi National
Park a little after 6.30am, and were soon through the formalities but
the entry through the gate was a little tardier. It was Mustafa’s
first visit to NNP, so we were in for Atlassing and impressing him
with what we had!

The week had been a dry one, and now it was a glorious sunrise and
whilst we appreciated it, it magically disappeared as mist rose
immediately to obscure it and it grew colder. Birds were reluctant to
call or show themselves, but we slowly picked up the commoner species
with our first stop at Ivory Burning Site. With nothing of note here,
and missing the Zanzibar Greenbuls in such a long time we continued to
Nagalomon Dam. Whilst the Sacred Ibis colony further down the dam was
in full swing, the only nesting birds on the island were Darters, with
about ten present including young birds. Around the edge were four
Yellow-billed Storks, five Great Cormorants which might be the highest
count of birds together for this Park, the first of about twenty
Black-winged Kites recorded today throughout the Park, a Red-knobbed
Coot is possibly the first on this dam, four Grey Crowned Cranes, no
migrant waders but two Violet-backed Starling were however migrants
from within Africa (or the southern Middle-east).

Taking the back road to Hyena Dam it was quiet apart from numerous
White-winged Widowbirds and Red-billed Queleas which were both
throughout much of the Park today. We had the first of three Augur
Buzzards, but that was it apart from the delightful House Sparrows!
Hyena Dam gave us very little, a Yellow-billed Egret, three more
Crowned Cranes, the first three returning adult Black-winged Stilts
and a Wood Sandpiper, an adult African Jacana, the days only Barn
Swallow, three Chestnut Sparrows which is the first in the far north
of the Park, and the first of the Quailfinch which were throughout the
grasslands. We continued along the Mokoyeti and back around to
Nagalomon Dam, there was a Great Egret, but nothing else on the ox-bow
whatsoever, the first of two Red-faced Cisticolas with the other being
at Ololo, but the grass was abounding with seedeating species
including many Common, two Black-faced and thirty or more
Orange-breasted Waxbills (see image), a few Parasitic Weavers, thee
Cardinal Queleas and the days only Rosy-breasted Longclaw in
non-breeding dress.

Heading towards Kingfisher area, we had the only Diederic Cuckoo of
the day, and at Kingfisher swamp coaxed a pair of African Water Rails
in with one coming into view (see image), whilst the female sounded if
she were staying out of sight with chicks. Out-of-plumage noisy
Yellow-crowned Bishops whistled past us without stopping, and a
Highland Rush Warbler called from cover. The Picnic Site was
reasonably productive, the days only Red-chested Cuckoo called towards
the river, as did the first evidence of Fish Eagle for the day.
Otherwise it was the usual Red-throated Tit, Brown Parisoma and the
Red-fronted Barbets were nesting in a branch. The only Greater
Blue-eared Starlings for the day were also here. Further along the
road we had a pair of Secretarybirds, it was a good day for them with
eight individuals of which three were pairs, and likely no
duplication.

On the road to Ololo there were numbers of Chestnut Sparrows including
full breeding plumaged males, a few Speckle-fronted Weavers, and
Grey-headed Social-Weavers both carrying nesting material and a very
young bird. Banded Parisomas were also here. At Ololo there was a
surprising amount of activity with many common bush birds including an
African Pygmy Kingfisher in the same place as last week, another Brown
Parisoma, Hildebrandt’s Starling, and a pair of Crimson-rumped
Waxbills. After leaving here we had a Long-crested Eagle and a second
bird near Rhino Circuit.

It was quiet as we passed Baboon Cliffs up to the woodland above Hippo
Pools, the days only Long-billed Pipit (see image) and
Cinnamon-breasted Buntings were on the ascent, but in the woodland we
only added a pair of Ruppell’s Starlings. Quiet also along the
Mbagathi and Rhino Circuit where there were numbers of Marabous here
and at Athi Dam, a Striated Heron, a number of new birds for the day
included all three normal Woodpeckers, Southern Black Flycatcher and
Lesser Masked Weaver. Near the Pipeline, there was a pair of
Painted-snipe in the same place in the run-off which still has water,
and Vitelline Masked Weaver close by.

Athi Dam was a disappointment, so much has left with no interesting
substitutes, plenty of Marabous, four Yellow-billed and two
Open-billed Storks, the days first two African Spoonbills, three
roosting Black-crowned Night-Herons, a Fish Eagle, pair of Crowned
Cranes, the only thick-knee was one Spotted, two Black-winged Stilts,
a single Kittlitz’s Plover, three Common Sandpipers and a Little
Stint. The day’s only Laughing Doves were in the bushes. The Vulture
Drinking Pools were only attracting White-backed as well as many
Marabous and there was another Little Stint.

On the homeward run we had a male Hartlaub’s Bustard and a dozen
Wattled Starlings in the grasslands, nothing at Karen PS Dam, and
numerous Black-headed Herons at Eland Hollow (as well as all over the
Park), and the days only pair of Banded Martins. Another Striated
Heron was at the Nagalomon run-off but nothing additional on the dam.
Finally heading towards Langata Gate we added a beautiful African
Goshawk, Hartlaub’s Turaco, Yellow-rumped Tinkerbird, Yellow-whiskered
and Cabanis’ Greenbuls, White-eyed Slaty Flycatcher, White-starred
Robin and Amethyst Sunbird.

We were through the gate at 5.15pm, having recorded an all time August
high of 187 species, for a first time visit you would have to be
impressed with the place!

Presumed male of the pair at Kingfisher Swamp which sounded as if they
had chicks.

2	LITTLE STINT
This worn adult at Athi Dam is not showing much of the rufous breeding
plumage but may be one of the less colourful individuals.

3	ORANGE-BREASTED WAXBILL
Quite a frequent sight usually flying away over the grasslands,
particularly the circuit from Hyena Dam, along the Mokoyeti and back
to Nagalomon Dam.

4	GROSBEAK WEAVER
