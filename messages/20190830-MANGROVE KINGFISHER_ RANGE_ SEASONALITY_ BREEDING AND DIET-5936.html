Dear All,
I have been back through the old kenyabirdsnet sightings, and was
unable to locate any records of Mangrove Kingfishers outside of the
April-November window. I was particularly  interested in the Tana
Delta as it had been suggested that it might be resident there. I did
find a very interesting piece of evidence that highly suggests that it
is a migrant there like everywhere else in coastal Kenya.
It was in the Dowsett-Lemaire's report in Oct-Dec 2006, they surveyed
the avifauna of Tana Delta based at Kipini; under Mangrove Kingfisher
they state " Very common (and noisy) in coastal thickets in Oct.,
singing in duets at dawn and dusk. Heard two singing to each other in
forest clumps opposite base camp (Oct.,early Nov.); seen at new camp.
Heard at forest edges in Witu Extension and Luimishi. Not singing in
second half of Nov. nor Dec. and then easily overlooked (none seen in
Dec.).
Best to all
Brian
