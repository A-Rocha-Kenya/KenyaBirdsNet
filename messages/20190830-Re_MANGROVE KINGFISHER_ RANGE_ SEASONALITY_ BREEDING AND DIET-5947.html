Dear Don,
I must confess I did not know that they were racially separated, but
it does look like quite a bit of confusion that someone is
perpetrating, I can accept that if there is a disjunct resident
population in Southern Somalia it could very well be a separate form
from the wintering birds, but to give a separate name to a bird from
Pangani in Tz all through coastal Kenya to Somalia which is a migrant
from somewhere else, rather suggests that the taxon is coming from
further south in S Tz and Mozambique, and we don't see nominate at all
as they migrate between KZN and Eastern Cape, or it's a monotype in
two or possibly three populations, I really think what you have told
me cannot happen. If there are distinctions in the races, I cannot
imagine that no-one took images of the bird netted at Boni, would we
be able to determine race from an image?
Best for now
Brian

Dear Brian. There are TWO POPULATIONS: Nominate birds are strictly Southern
African, white our birds are ranivorus (Type locality Pangani).
Whether ranivorus is worthy of separate subspecific status is debatable
however.

One thought being that nominate birds extends up to Dar-es-Salaam, Zanzibar
and Pemba, with ranivorus from the Pangani River north to Somalia.

All depends on who you want to follow.

Hi Nate,
You have been impressively busy, this is such a good haul of data,
thanks so much for all this input.
I don't know exactly how to drive eBird, so did not get to the
individual records themselves, but I did get into the images. For the
East African records they all fell into the March-November period
except, a bird on Mafia which could have a resident population like
Pemba.
When Don had his breeding record it was August which is when Mangrove
K's are in Kenya. On your detailed sighting list, the only record
outside of it was Doris's Tana records on 3rd and 4th Feb 2017, which
is interesting.
What I do find very intriguing is that when our birds are present, is
exactly the time they winter in KZN where they do not breed, which
certainly supports there being two different populations. When our
birds go south, so do the KZN birds to breed in the Eastern Cape. It's
dangerous to suppose anything in birds nowadays, but it would suggest
that our birds do not go as far south as Natal and are southern
Tanzanian and Mozambican birds.
Best for now
Brian
