Thanks Brian.   Every now and then, a Mouse can help a Lion.

If people would like to drill down on December-February records only,
this web link will pull that up:

Again, it helps to click the "Show Points Sooner" box on the right
side of the page to make the individual site markers more distinct as
you zoom in.

There are a finite number of eBird reports from December-February in
Kenya - they are listed below (except the Ngulia record which has
already been mentioned)

Working north to south:

January 8, 1987 - Eric VanderWerf had one just west of the Sabaki
River Mouth near the Malinidi-Garsen Road bridge.

February 17, 2019 - Ri Nique had one at 'Bofa-Kilifi'.

December 7, 2016 - Doris Schaule had one at the Nguuni Nature
Sanctuary just north of Mombasa.

January 10, 2015 - Laurent Esselen had one just east of Haller Park
outside Mombasa.   <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S21277789">https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S21277789</a>

January 8 2015 - Andrew Rains reported two south of Diani Beach.

January 10, 2016 - Simon Carter had two at the Gazi mangrove
boardwalk.   Notes say "Calling to each other. Recording Id'd by James
Bradley."  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S26813864">https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S26813864</a>

February 4, 2017 - Rob Williams had one in Shimoni at the 'Deep Sea
Adventures" garden.   <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S34172736">https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S34172736</a>

February 14, 1995 - four were reported around Vanga to the Kenya
Birdfinder project from a National Museum of Kenya Ornithology
Department waterbird count.


The bulk of them seem to be in the past four years - perhaps this is
an artifact of eBird not existing until recently.


Good birding,

Nate

Hi Nate,
You have been impressively busy, this is such a good haul of data,
thanks so much for all this input.
I don't know exactly how to drive eBird, so did not get to the
individual records themselves, but I did get into the images. For the
East African records they all fell into the March-November period
except, a bird on Mafia which could have a resident population like
Pemba.
When Don had his breeding record it was August which is when Mangrove
K's are in Kenya. On your detailed sighting list, the only record
outside of it was Doris's Tana records on 3rd and 4th Feb 2017, which
is interesting.
What I do find very intriguing is that when our birds are present, is
exactly the time they winter in KZN where they do not breed, which
certainly supports there being two different populations. When our
birds go south, so do the KZN birds to breed in the Eastern Cape. It's
dangerous to suppose anything in birds nowadays, but it would suggest
that our birds do not go as far south as Natal and are southern
Tanzanian and Mozambican birds.
Best for now
Brian
