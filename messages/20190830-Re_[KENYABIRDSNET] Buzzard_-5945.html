Hi Fleur,
It really is a very early date for a Common Buzzard, but
Honey-Buzzards do sometimes oversummer, although I haven't heard of a
bird doing that in Nairobi before but a good forest like Karura would
be ideal as long as there are bees and wasps,
That's all I can suggest,
Cheers
Brian

Greetings birders

As Brian noted, I used to think of July and August as quiet birding months,
but Nature Kenya's Wednesday Morning Birdwalks have been recording long bird
lists in July and August this year.

At Karura Forest this week (Aug 28) we had a variety of raptors – Ayres’s
Hawk Eagle, Long-crested Eagle, Augur Buzzard, Black Kite. Then a buzzard
flew rapidly across the playing field near the swamp. It seemed the right
size, shape and coloring for a dark Common (Steppe) Buzzard. But August 28
seems awfully early. Any advice?

Wishing you good birding, Fleur
