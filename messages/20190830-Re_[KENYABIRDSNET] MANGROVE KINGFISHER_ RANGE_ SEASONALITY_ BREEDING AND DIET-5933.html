Thanks for this Don,
That Ngulia bird was certainly a migrant, can you remember if it was
caught at night because it's likely that's when they move but if late
November it's getting pretty late. It also begs the question why it
would be so off course if it were going south, if coming north it has
plenty of space in which to deviate, but going south it can't have
started moving from very far north of Ngulia anyway! Ngulia is 180km
from the nearest piece of coast which is strangely equidistant all the
way from Kilifi to Mombasa! In Horn of Africa it states it occurs in
Somalia north to the Jubba and Shabeelle Rivers where it is "a
presumed resident."
Do you know of any completed nest record cards for Kenya?
Two interesting kingfishers in succession!
Best for now
Brian

Dear Brian.  All very interesting.  All I can offer is one year I recall
finding a Mangrove Kingfisher nesting in the hole of a tree in the middle of
Gede Forest. It was going to the edge of the forest (thick bush) and taking
food back to the young.  Certainly not crabs !!

Remember the one ringed at Ngulia on 01 December 2003.  Long way from any
crabs for sure.

Worth calculating in a straight line how far that was from the nearest known
locality at the coast.

Best wishes
Don
