Sorry - I meant to say " For what it's worth, changing the eBird

Fascinating conversation everyone.

I did a species search for Mangrove Kingfisher records in eBird and zoomed in to look at Kenya reports.   There are many reports (some with photos) besides those mentioned thus far.

To view them, visit this web link to a Mangrove Kingfisher search on eBird - check the "Show Points Sooner" box on the right of the screen to display better:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://ebird.org/map/mankin2?neg=true&amp;env.minX=&amp;env.minY=&amp;env.maxX=&amp;env.maxY=&amp;zh=false&amp;gp=false&amp;ev=Z&amp;mr=1-12&amp;bmo=1&amp;emo=12&amp;yr=all&amp;byr=1900&amp;eyr=2019">https://ebird.org/map/mankin2?neg=true&amp;env.minX=&amp;env.minY=&amp;env.maxX=&amp;env.maxY=&amp;zh=false&amp;gp=false&amp;ev=Z&amp;mr=1-12&amp;bmo=1&amp;emo=12&amp;yr=all&amp;byr=1900&amp;eyr=2019</a>

One can alter the search for specific months by clicking the "Date" pull-down in the menu near the top of the page.   For what it's worth, changing the search to only the months from March-April still yields quite a few results in coastal Kenya.

Since Don's breeding record at Gede was in August, I looked for eBird reports from late July-September.    There are quite a few:

Sunday August 10, 2008 Brad Bergstrom photographed a Mangrove Kingfisher on the Lower Tana River Delta between Anasa and Kibokoni:   <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S37155792">https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S37155792</a>

Other eBird reports of Mangrove Kingfishers at the Lower Tana River Delta Hotspot are:
February 3rd and 4th 2017 - Doris Schaule
April 9th 2019 - Mustafa Amanjee

Tuesday September 20, 2011 Fiona Reid observed a Mangrove Kingfisher at Che Shale (Kenya Birdfinder historical record entered into eBird).  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S39111039">https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S39111039</a>

There are several eBird checklists reporting this species from the Sabaki River mouth, including:

August 15, 1989 - David Holyoak.  Notes say "S. shore of estuary"    <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S19612770">https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S19612770</a>

Monday September 7, 2009 Doug Macaulay observed one at Lake Jilore's north edge

Monday September 7, 2009 Doug Macaulay also observed one in the northern Arabuko-Sokoke Forest.  Mouth-watering checklist with Mangrove Kingfisher photo:  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S7299010">https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S7299010</a>

There are multiple other eBird reports of Mangrove Kingfisher in August-September from the Arabuko-Sokoke Forest. A sample:

Saturday October 6, 2018 Albert Baya observed one at Lake Jilore

There are multiple September-October eBird reports from Gede Ruins.

There are multiple reports from multiple sites around Watamu and further inland on Mida Creek from August-October.

Also a couple of October reports from Kalifi, a couple of August reports from Vipino Ridge, and numbers of reports from the Mombasa area (Mamba Vilage Crocodile Farm, Haller Park, Bamburi, etc)

There are also numbers of eBird reports from Shimba Hills in late July, August and September.

Plus various other reports from coastal areas.

Good birding,

Nate

Dear Brian. The Ngulia bird I think was caught in the early morning (no doubt arriving in the night).

Other dated records that we have are:

Historical specimens from Mombasa area Sept-October 1900.

50+ in mangroves around Vanga (Lunga Lunga) 29 April 1990. Certainly suggestive of a movement ( returning north maybe ??)

Malindi August 1984; Sabaki early November 1989.
My breeding record at Gede was in August.
Very vocal around Witu and the Kipini conservancy during October 2006, but gone by late November onwards.

Mombasa area: present June-August. Also a single November record.

There are NO RECORDS from Sunbird Tours to the north Kenya coast during January and February which would point to it being absent from the coast late November - March /April.

So it seems to be largely present on our coast from April - mid November.

Reportedly resident all year at Dar-es-Salaam and on Pemba, but on Zanzibar largely October - February only.

Only a couple of nest records cards that I know of, one of which was is unreliable. The other points to an early October breeding (Kenya coast).

Hope this helps. It certainly points to it being a migrant to our coasts April-October.

Best wishes
Don

Thanks for this Don,
That Ngulia bird was certainly a migrant, can you remember if it was
caught at night because it's likely that's when they move but if late
November it's getting pretty late. It also begs the question why it
would be so off course if it were going south, if coming north it has
plenty of space in which to deviate, but going south it can't have
started moving from very far north of Ngulia anyway! Ngulia is 180km
from the nearest piece of coast which is strangely equidistant all the
way from Kilifi to Mombasa! In Horn of Africa it states it occurs in
Somalia north to the Jubba and Shabeelle Rivers where it is "a
presumed resident."
Do you know of any completed nest record cards for Kenya?
Two interesting kingfishers in succession!
Best for now
Brian

Dear Brian. All very interesting. All I can offer is one year I recall
finding a Mangrove Kingfisher nesting in the hole of a tree in the middle of
Gede Forest. It was going to the edge of the forest (thick bush) and taking
food back to the young. Certainly not crabs !!

Remember the one ringed at Ngulia on 01 December 2003. Long way from any
crabs for sure.

Worth calculating in a straight line how far that was from the nearest known
locality at the coast.

Best wishes
Don
