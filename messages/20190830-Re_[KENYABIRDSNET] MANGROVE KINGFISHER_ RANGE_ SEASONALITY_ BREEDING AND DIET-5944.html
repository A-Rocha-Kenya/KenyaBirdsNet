Hi Fleur,
Thanks for this, we are all learning something. Although your records
fall into the normal window for the species, Boni-Dodori might even
have a separate population as is suggested for southern Somalia, or
both the Kingfisher and the Robin-Chats were all southerners  and left
shortly after you did!
Best for now
Brian

Coming into this discussion a bit lateâ€¦.

Museum researchers and ringers caught a Mangrove Kingfisher in early
November 2013 near Mangai in the Boni-Dodori area. What a bird to see up
close! The same ringing session caught a netful of Red-capped Robin Chats.
Mangrove Kingfishers were also recorded in riparian forest in the
Boni-Dodori area in the first half of April 2014.

Mangrove Kingfishers are often seen in Dakatcha Woodland, a good distance
from the sea. (There are fresh-water crabs, but only obvious in the rainy
season.) I did not realize these kingfishers were migrants from the south
and wondered why sometimes we do not see them in Dakatcha forests. Now I
understand.

Good birding to all, Fleur

Fascinating conversation everyone.

I did a species search for Mangrove Kingfisher records in eBird and zoomed
in to look at Kenya reports.   There are many reports (some with photos)
besides those mentioned thus far.

To view them, visit this web link to a Mangrove Kingfisher search on eBird
- check the "Show Points Sooner" box on the right of the screen to display
better:

One can alter the search for specific months by clicking the "Date"
pull-down in the menu near the top of the page.   For what it's worth,
changing the search to only the months from March-April still yields quite
a few results in coastal Kenya.

Since Don's breeding record at Gede was in August, I looked for eBird
reports from late July-September.    There are quite a few:

Sunday August 10, 2008 Brad Bergstrom photographed a Mangrove Kingfisher
on the Lower Tana River Delta between Anasa and Kibokoni:

Other eBird reports of Mangrove Kingfishers at the Lower Tana River Delta
Hotspot are:
February 3rd and 4th 2017 - Doris Schaule
April 9th 2019 - Mustafa Amanjee

Tuesday September 20, 2011 Fiona Reid observed a Mangrove Kingfisher at
Che Shale (Kenya Birdfinder historical record entered into eBird).

There are several eBird checklists reporting this species from the Sabaki
River mouth, including:

Saturday October 6, 2018 Albert Baya observed one at Lake Jilore

There are multiple September-October eBird reports from Gede Ruins.

There are multiple reports from multiple sites around Watamu and further
inland on Mida Creek from August-October.

Also a couple of October reports from Kalifi, a couple of August reports
from Vipino Ridge, and numbers of reports from the Mombasa area (Mamba
Vilage Crocodile Farm, Haller Park, Bamburi, etc)

There are also numbers of eBird reports from Shimba Hills in late July,
August and September.

Plus various other reports from coastal areas.

Good birding,

Nate

Dear Brian. The Ngulia bird I think was caught in the early morning (no
doubt arriving in the night).

Other dated records that we have are:

Historical specimens from Mombasa area Sept-October 1900.

50+ in mangroves around Vanga (Lunga Lunga) 29 April 1990. Certainly
suggestive of a movement ( returning north maybe ??)

Malindi August 1984; Sabaki early November 1989.
My breeding record at Gede was in August.
Very vocal around Witu and the Kipini conservancy during October 2006, but
gone by late November onwards.

Mombasa area: present June-August. Also a single November record.

There are NO RECORDS from Sunbird Tours to the north Kenya coast during
January and February which would point to it being absent from the coast
late November - March /April.

So it seems to be largely present on our coast from April - mid November.

Reportedly resident all year at Dar-es-Salaam and on Pemba, but on
Zanzibar largely October - February only.

Only a couple of nest records cards that I know of, one of which was is
unreliable. The other points to an early October breeding (Kenya coast).

Hope this helps. It certainly points to it being a migrant to our coasts
April-October.

Best wishes
Don

Thanks for this Don,
That Ngulia bird was certainly a migrant, can you remember if it was
caught at night because it's likely that's when they move but if late
November it's getting pretty late. It also begs the question why it
would be so off course if it were going south, if coming north it has
plenty of space in which to deviate, but going south it can't have
started moving from very far north of Ngulia anyway! Ngulia is 180km
from the nearest piece of coast which is strangely equidistant all the
way from Kilifi to Mombasa! In Horn of Africa it states it occurs in
Somalia north to the Jubba and Shabeelle Rivers where it is "a
presumed resident."
Do you know of any completed nest record cards for Kenya?
Two interesting kingfishers in succession!
Best for now
Brian

Dear Brian. All very interesting. All I can offer is one year I recall
finding a Mangrove Kingfisher nesting in the hole of a tree in the
middle of
Gede Forest. It was going to the edge of the forest (thick bush) and
taking
food back to the young. Certainly not crabs !!

Remember the one ringed at Ngulia on 01 December 2003. Long way from
any
crabs for sure.

Worth calculating in a straight line how far that was from the nearest
known
locality at the coast.
