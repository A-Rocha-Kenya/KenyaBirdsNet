Southern Somalia has a very large population of Mangrove Kingfishers (surprisingly it seems “yet to be found in mangroves in Somalia" (Ash &amp; Miskell 1998). Given that, I wonder how many Somali birds move south during the December-March period, which could account for reports in coastal Kenya at that time.

I think there is still a lot to learn about some of our kingfishers.

Don

Interestingly I see that there have been three southern Somalia records of Levaillant’s Cuckoo (March, April and August, and the April one was an all-black morph.  Now what does that tell us ??

Thanks once again Nate,
The December to February records are something to worry about. It is
unfortunate that not one is accompanied by an image. Simon's Jan
record of birds calling on the South Coast with confirmation of the
recording taken by James Bradley as Mangrove would seem irrefutable,
Doris on her home patch at Nguni has seen enough MK's in her time.

There is one issue which cannot be tested without images, and it might
seem insulting, but immature Grey-headed Kingfishers after leaving the
nest take a while to acquire the chestnut underparts and start off
plain below. In fact at this stage they do not look like GHK with
their whitish underparts. They are also found on the coastal fringe
where resident (race hyacinthina). Of course GHK has a blackish centre
to the back whilst MK have a bluish-grey back. Visitors could be
misled by juv GHK if unfamiliar with our avifauna.
But then again maybe the odd bird in some years doesn't go back.

Then as we see, we have someone like Clive who studied birds on the
coast for a number of consecutive years and never had one out of their
normal window of appearance.

So I think these records are exceptions rather than any rule, I don't
know how other people read into this.

It would be good if Colin Jackson could help with the Bird Log at
Arocha, and Neil Baker for the situation as per the Tanzanian Atlas,
both of these would weigh heavily to support the exact status one way
or the other,

Best for now
Brian

Thanks Brian.   Every now and then, a Mouse can help a Lion.

If people would like to drill down on December-February records only,
this web link will pull that up:

There are a finite number of eBird reports from December-February in
Kenya - they are listed below (except the Ngulia record which has
already been mentioned)

Working north to south:

January 8, 1987 - Eric VanderWerf had one just west of the Sabaki
River Mouth near the Malinidi-Garsen Road bridge.

February 17, 2019 - Ri Nique had one at 'Bofa-Kilifi'.

December 7, 2016 - Doris Schaule had one at the Nguuni Nature
Sanctuary just north of Mombasa.

outside Mombasa.   <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S21277789">https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S21277789</a>

January 8 2015 - Andrew Rains reported two south of Diani Beach.

January 10, 2016 - Simon Carter had two at the Gazi mangrove
boardwalk.   Notes say "Calling to each other. Recording Id'd by James
Bradley."  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S26813864">https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S26813864</a>

February 4, 2017 - Rob Williams had one in Shimoni at the 'Deep Sea
Adventures" garden.   <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S34172736">https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S34172736</a>

February 14, 1995 - four were reported around Vanga to the Kenya
Birdfinder project from a National Museum of Kenya Ornithology
Department waterbird count.


The bulk of them seem to be in the past four years - perhaps this is
an artifact of eBird not existing until recently.


Good birding,

Nate

Hi Nate,
You have been impressively busy, this is such a good haul of data,
thanks so much for all this input.
I don't know exactly how to drive eBird, so did not get to the
individual records themselves, but I did get into the images. For the
East African records they all fell into the March-November period
except, a bird on Mafia which could have a resident population like
Pemba.
When Don had his breeding record it was August which is when Mangrove
K's are in Kenya. On your detailed sighting list, the only record
outside of it was Doris's Tana records on 3rd and 4th Feb 2017, which
is interesting.
What I do find very intriguing is that when our birds are present, is
exactly the time they winter in KZN where they do not breed, which
certainly supports there being two different populations. When our
birds go south, so do the KZN birds to breed in the Eastern Cape. It's
dangerous to suppose anything in birds nowadays, but it would suggest
that our birds do not go as far south as Natal and are southern
Tanzanian and Mozambican birds.
Best for now
Brian
