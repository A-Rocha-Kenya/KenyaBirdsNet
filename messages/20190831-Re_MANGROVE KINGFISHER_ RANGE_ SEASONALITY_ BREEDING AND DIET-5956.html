Hi Don,
Somali birds coming down, now there's a thought! Maybe the Ngulia bird
belongs here being early Dec, and they of course breed along the
rivers well inland to start with. You would think there would be more
wanderings further into the inland than we have, with just two,
especially if they have no interest in mangroves at all.
Even in Grey-headeds Ash &amp; Miskell say that nominate is permanent
resident whilst hyacinthina in the south is completely migratory not
being found from Dec, then they must boost the Kenya population.
You are so right, there is definitely a lot more to be learnt about
our Kingfishers!
Cheers
Brian

Southern Somalia has a very large population of Mangrove Kingfishers
(surprisingly it seems â€œyet to be found in mangroves in Somalia" (Ash &amp;
Miskell 1998). Given that, I wonder how many Somali birds move south during
the December-March period, which could account for reports in coastal Kenya
at that time.

I think there is still a lot to learn about some of our kingfishers.
