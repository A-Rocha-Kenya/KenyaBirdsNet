Hi Hugh,
It's a pleasure, but I think we also owe you in showing the way that
we really don't know much about our own Mangrove Kingfishers either
and we are all now learning that we don't!!!
Everyone who has contributed will have received the thanks with the
cc's, and will certainly keep you advised. I will now disappear until
the 5th in Madagascar when I will be re-attached to Wifi.
Best for now
Brian

Hi Brian,

Please convey my sincere thanks to all who have contributed info about
this little-known kingfisher species. Replies have been hugely
interesting and its been evident to me that we all still have much to
learn about this sparsely populated bird, particularly with regard to
diet dependence in breeding and non-breeding seasons. One can also ask
why this species only occupies the east coast of Africa, and why its
never colonized part of the western side of this continent.

Please keep me in the loop with any new information that may surface.

Kind regards

Hugh Chittenden

Thanks very much for this Neil.
As you say it is difficult to read into the monthly individual reports
without the added information of geographic distribution that shows
calendar distribution. I must admit I am intrigued by the spike in
October where it is nearly twice as much as the months either side of
it. I wonder if this marks the main departure southwards out of Kenya
and Somalia to breeding grounds further south, and the other spike in
April again nearly twice the number as the months either side mark the
return from the south. You must admit it looks very odd, and does fit
with what we are learning about movements in Kenya.
Just as a bye the bye, apart from Pemba and maybe Mafia are you aware
of many breeding records in Tz?
Best for now
Brian
