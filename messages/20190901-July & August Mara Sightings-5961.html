<p style="margin:0px 0px 10.66px"><span lang="EN-US" style="margin:0px"><font color="#000000" face="verdana">Here are a
few interesting records from the Mara from July/August.</font></span></p>

<p style="margin:0px 0px 10.66px"><span lang="EN-US" style="margin:0px"><font color="#000000" face="verdana">July 30<sup><font size="1">th</font></sup>
–A <b>leucistic Lappet-faced Vulture</b>
was seen near Black Rocks just north of the Sand River in the MMNR. See the
attached photo. This individual was seen earlier this year in Naboisho
Conservancy. A family of <b>Mountain
Kestrels</b> was seen on their breeding cliff in Olderkesi Conservancy. </font></span></p>

<p style="margin:0px 0px 10.66px"><span lang="EN-US" style="margin:0px"><font color="#000000" face="verdana">July 31<sup><font size="1">st</font></sup>
– A singing <b>Red-capped Robinchat</b> was
seen at Cottars 1920s in Olderkesi. </font></span></p>

<p style="margin:0px 0px 10.66px"><span lang="EN-US" style="margin:0px"><font color="#000000" face="verdana">August 1<sup><font size="1">st</font></sup>
– A <b>Eurasian Hoopoe</b> was seen in the
SE corner of the MMNR. See the attached photo. This bird was seen following an
African Hoopoe around. They looked and acted like a pair. A pair of <b>White-naped Raven</b>s was seen feeding on
a Wildebeest carcass close to Makaria Forest. See the attached photo. </font></span></p>

<p style="margin:0px 0px 10.66px"><span lang="EN-US" style="margin:0px"><font color="#000000" face="verdana">August 6<sup><font size="1">th</font></sup>
– An adult male <b>Blue Swallow</b> was seen
in the Mara Triangle feeding close to the salt lick area. A pair of <b>Pearl-spotted Owlets</b> was found calling
close to the Maji ya Ndege campsite in the Mara Triangle. I rarely see this
species in the Mara. <span style="margin:0px"> </span>At least 6 <b>Marsh Owls</b> were seen quartering the
grasslands in the late evening by Serena in the Mara Triangle. See the attached
picture. </font></span></p>

<p style="margin:0px 0px 10.66px"><span lang="EN-US" style="margin:0px"><font color="#000000" face="verdana">August 7<sup><font size="1">th</font></sup>
– An <b>African Crake</b> was flushed from
wet grassland close to the Ngiro-are Ranger base in the Mara Triangle. A pair
of <b>Black-headed Gonoleks</b> was heard
duetting along the stream by the Ngiro-are Ranger Base. I think there are
multiple pairs of Gonoleks resident in this area of the Mara. </font></span></p>

<p style="margin:0px 0px 10.66px"><span lang="EN-US" style="margin:0px"><font color="#000000" face="verdana">August 5<sup><font size="1">th</font></sup>
– 8<sup><font size="1">th</font></sup> - While driving grass tracks in the Mara Triangle I noted lots
of <b>Black Coucals</b>, <b>Black-backed Cisticolas</b>, <b>Broad-tailed Warblers</b> and <b>Red-winged Francolins</b>. Seems the late
rains really helped these species. </font></span></p>

<p style="margin:0px 0px 10.66px"><span lang="EN-US" style="margin:0px"><font color="#000000" face="verdana">August 13<sup><font size="1">th</font></sup>
– Three <b>African Cuckoo-hawks</b> (2
juveniles and 1 adult) were seen in Lemek Conservancy. The juveniles were
feeding together like harriers out in the grassland. It was fascinating to
watch them. See some attached pictures. An adult <b>Shikra</b> was seen in Lemek Conservancy. I rarely see this species in
the Mara. Multiple pairs of <b>Lizard
Buzzards</b> were seen and heard in Lemek Conservancy. </font></span></p>

<p style="margin:0px 0px 10.66px"><span lang="EN-US" style="margin:0px"><font color="#000000" face="verdana">August 15<sup><font size="1">th</font></sup>
– The first big flocks of <b>Caspian
Plovers</b> were seen out on the short grass plains in Naboisho Conservancy.
Great to have them back! </font></span></p>

birding,</font></span></p>
