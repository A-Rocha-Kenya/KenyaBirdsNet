Dear All,
After 7 weeks of being away and not being able to bird Nairobi
National Park. I was in there today (21st) with Nigel Hunter and Fleur
Ng’Weno. It turned up a very good bird, new for Nairobi and dare I say
also for Finch Pentad!
This is an alert so that those interested can try and see this bird,
(images attached), rather than wait for the full report of
observations.
There are only two records of Short-toed Snake-Eagle in Kenya, this
appears to be a pale adult (below) lacking the white tips to tail and
flight-feathers. It has been multiply shot in the wings, and the
demise of whoever did this whilst it was on migration would make this
world a better place. It’s healthy and no apparent body wounds, it has
an appetite and was on the old burnt area, which is the open ground on
the right, two kilometres from Kingfisher Picnic Site on the way to
the metal bridge across the river valley en route to Maasai Gate.
Best of luck to all who try for it.
Brian
