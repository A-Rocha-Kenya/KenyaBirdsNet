    <p>Dear Don / Brian,</p>
    <p>It's a wee while since this conversation but I had promised I
      would share the plot of Mangrove Kingfisher phenology from records
      submitted to the African Bird Atlas Project (i.e. for us the Kenya
      Bird Map). These were extracted and plotted by David Clarance who
      has produced some excellent resources for anyone with a little bit
      of R knowledge to be able to download the data for any species /
      area and look at them. <br>
    </p>
    <p>The first plot is of all records of Mangrove Kingfisher for the
      coast with a Loess smoothing function applied. The second shows
      the whole data set (red) against north coast records (green) and
      south coast (blue).</p>
    <p>There is no doubt at all that the Mangrove Kingfisher is strongly
      migratory in Kenya - and to answer your question about
      territories, Brian, yes, they definitely do hold territory on the
      non-breeding grounds on the coast. We have had a bird that was
      always at our compost heap and while s/he has disappeared this
      year, I have another bird which has been calling regularly from
      the same spot elsewhere on the Watamu peninsula. <br>
    </p>
    <p>I would echo your sentiments about the validity of the apparently
      relatively many records in Dec-Feb - for sure there will be a few
      (and it would be very interesting to consider if these are indeed
      Somali birds wandering down to us), but it is clear that this is
      an Afrotropical migrant to the coast.</p>

I'm in Mad. at present and for next five weeks but wifi tonight!
I wanted to thank you for all your very interesting latest input. The
dates on that bird retrapped 13 times, do they suggest a double
passage? It could help us learn a lot. In fact all the retrap details
contribute to the bigger picture. Do any individuals stake out a
non-breeding territory along the Watamu coast or are all on the move
to get elsewhere?
It would be very nice to see a map of dated distributions from atlas
data, I am pretty confident that it will confirm what we are learning
about it being a migrant late March-early Dec but records outside of
this period are the exception whilst any breeding records are
exceptional!
Best for now
Brian
