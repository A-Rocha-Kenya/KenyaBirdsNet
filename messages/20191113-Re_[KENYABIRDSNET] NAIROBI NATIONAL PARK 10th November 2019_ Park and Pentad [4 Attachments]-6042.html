<div dir="ltr">Hi Brian,<br><br>Thanks for the great report as always. The Common Buttonquail is exciting. I&#39;ve never seen one in the park. Was the Lappet-faced Vulture an adult or immature?<br><br>Regarding the African Hawk Eagles, it&#39;s not too uncommon for this species to hunt cooperatively. They are similar to Verreaux&#39;s Eagles in that regard. One of my most memorable sightings was watching a pair of Af hawk eagles go for helmeted guineafowl at Olerai Conservancy (Kajiado). Athough they very narrowly missed them! I suspect there may be a new pair nesting either along the Mbagathi or somewhere close. I know of a pair nesting 15km south of the park but the frequency of recent sightings makes me think there is another closer pair. Please let me know if you see them again as I&#39;m very keen on them.<br><br>Cheers,<br clear="all"><div><div dir="ltr" class="gmail_signature" data-smartmail="gmail_signature"><div dir="ltr"><div><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><font color="#444444"><b>Sidney Shema</b></font><div><br></div><div><a href="http://www.shotsbyshema.com/" style="font-size:12.8px" target="_blank">www.shotsbyshema.com</a><font color="#444444"><span style="font-size:12.8px"><br></span></font></div><div><font color="#444444"><span style="font-size:12.8px">Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ShotsByShema/" target="_blank">Shots By Shema - Untamed Photography</a> <br></span><span style="font-size:12.8px">Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shotsbyshema/" target="_blank">@ShotsByShema</a></span></font></div><div><br></div><div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><b style="font-size:12.8px"><span style="font-size:12.8px">Join the </span><a href="http://kenyabirdmap.adu.org.za/" target="_blank">Kenya Bird Map project</a> and contribute directly to bird conservation through citizen science!<br></b></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><br></div><br><div class="gmail_quote"><div dir="ltr" class="gmail_attr">On Tue, Nov 12, 2019 at 7:53 AM Brian Finch <a href="mailto:birdfinch@gmail.com">birdfinch@gmail.com</a> [kenyabirdsnet] &lt;<a href="mailto:kenyabirdsnet-noreply@yahoogroups.com">kenyabirdsnet-noreply@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br></div><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex">

      <p>NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK 10th November 2019, Park and Pentad<br>
<br>
Dear All,<br>
<br>
The visit to the Park last Monday was devoted to the Atlas, and has<br>
been posted to the net. My home Pentad came in with the highest total<br>
at 172 species for the day.<br>
There is a provision for recording for five consecutive days in the<br>
one Pentad, and so for Finch Pentad we decided to build on this 172,<br>
and although I was home all week and did not leave this property, over<br>
Tuesday up to Friday 8th I made three forays per day up into the<br>
Paddock, early morning, late morning and late afternoon to evening. In<br>
those ensuing days in spite of the inexplicable absence of migrants, I<br>
added in old taxonomic order Yellow-billed Egret, Scaly Francolin,<br>
African Harrier-Hawk, African Goshawk, African Hawk-Eagle (only our<br>
second ever), Long-crested Eagle, African Crowned Eagle, Martial<br>
Eagle, Barn Owl, African Green Pigeon, Emerald-spotted Wood-Dove (our<br>
days ridiculous miss in NNP), Hartlaub’s Turaco, Mottled Swift, Common<br>
Swift, Montane Nightjar, Eurasian Bee-eater, Golden-tailed Woodpecker,<br>
Black Cuckoo-shrike, Blackcap, Yellow-whiskered Greenbul, Yellow<br>
White-eye, White-starred Robin, Parrot-billed Sparrow and Village<br>
Weaver which brought the Full Protocol for the Pentad to 197 species.<br>
<br>
On Saturday morning a Golden-breasted Bunting was singing away outside<br>
the window but too late!<br>
<br>
When we had the Long-crested Eagle, I was trying to photograph it and<br>
whilst doing so an adult African Hawk-Eagle was as mentioned before,<br>
only our second for the property, and is rare enough in NNP coming<br>
from lower drier habitats, came hurtling into the paddock, so I<br>
stopped concentrating on the Long-crested turned to photograph the<br>
African Hawk-Eagle and finished up with neither. There must be a moral<br>
here!<br>
……………………………..<br>
<br>
On 10th November birding in NNP was going to be different, I was going<br>
for the day but my wings would be clipped as we would be looking<br>
concertedly for mammals, and birds would be as good as off the menu!<br>
<br>
Biddy and Charlie Davis and myself left the house, the roads being<br>
clear we were at the Main Entrance of NNP in twelve minutes. There<br>
were not many people at the paying station just one group of four<br>
ahead of us, and we were through the gate at 6.20am. The very first<br>
bird was a Black Cuckooshrike, a species not see anywhere in the Park<br>
during our big Atlas day last Monday. We did not visit either<br>
Nagalomon or Hyena Dams, but headed straight out towards Athi. Along<br>
the Mokoyeti there was a male Pallid Harrier, and one seen later had<br>
chosen a very strange perch, on the top or the SGR!<br>
We had a pair of Lions at No.8, Kitili and his brother. All through<br>
the day, other searchers were asking if we had seen anything today,<br>
and we would answer two lions at No. 8, and everyone all through the<br>
day replied that they had seen them. So there must have been many<br>
hundreds of people today who left the Park contented as they saw this<br>
pair which remained on show for most of the day evidently.<br>
We found our first Rhinos, and between the Hyena basin and Athi basin<br>
we were to find 23 Rhinos, 8 Black and 15 White, but strangely none at<br>
all in the Kingfisher area where they are usually to be found.<br>
Amongst, the other mammals we had 11 species of Antelopes, the most<br>
interesting being a mixed group of Common and Defassa Waterbucks near<br>
the descent to Athi Dam (see image). Mammals resembling both former<br>
species are unquestionably present, but the validity of even accepted<br>
racial differences in Kenya is questioned, let alone acceptance as<br>
full species. So only one Waterbuck is in the list of our eleven<br>
Antelopes. We encountered five Black-backed Jackals plus nearly the<br>
whole range of other plains game. In the evening we found twelve more<br>
Lions loafing in a valley on a track I had never been on before, along<br>
a valley that must be the Kisembe River near No. 29.<br>
What I found is, (and maybe this is a bit prejudiced), on birding days<br>
in NNP, we see an impressive variety of mammals, yet on a dedicated<br>
mammal day, you just don’t see the birds! I suppose it is because<br>
birders are slow and methodical searching every corner for something<br>
tucked away, and in doing so discover some good mammals. Mammal people<br>
are already programmed for a different type of search, with larger<br>
targets that are not necessarily more obvious than a small bird, but<br>
many are oblivious to small things sitting on bushes let alone waiting<br>
to see what hops through the interior of a bush. It would be true to<br>
say that all birders are interested in the mammals, it’s a shame the<br>
reverse is not true as with the complete package it has to give a<br>
better reward at the end of the day. I will stop philosophising now!<br>
But whilst mammaling I did see a few birds of interest, Athi Dam was<br>
really dead, one African Spoonbill and three Sacred Ibis apart from a<br>
few herons, a couple of Greenshank and a Wood Sandpiper. A Water<br>
Thick-knee was calling but not seen, six Spotted Thick-knees were<br>
though and there was a very noisy Banded Parisoma.<br>
<br>
We took another road I had never been on which takes off to the north<br>
of the road, west of the SGR crossing of the road and exiting the<br>
Park. It winds around the scrub towards the Mokoyeti Valley and loops<br>
back to the main road. This is also in Finch Pentad and interesting to<br>
see, and there was a nice female Common Buttonquail along here and an<br>
impressive Lappet-faced Vulture. We had our picnic lunch at Mbuni<br>
Picnic Site and were immediately beset upon by the resident<br>
Long-tailed Fiscals, surely these are the only scavenging,<br>
bread-eating true Shrikes in the world. We were also joined by an<br>
immature male Eurasian Golden Oriole, my first for this season and<br>
Black-faced Waxbill was also here. (See images). The best bird of the<br>
day was when we stopped to talk to other mammalers above Athi Basin,<br>
and whilst doing so I noticed two raptors way off in the grass. On<br>
looking at them I was delighted to see it was a pair of adult African<br>
Hawk-Eagles, and wondered if it had anything to do with our visitation<br>
in the Paddock a few days before. One bird sat close by, whilst the<br>
second was eating some prey that had been caught. This scenario was a<br>
bit odd, and not being able to differentiate the sexes did not help.<br>
As there was a couple, had the birds prior to our arrival exhibited<br>
social hunting and together they brought down the prey, as it not at<br>
all a common sight to see both members of a pair on the same prey, in<br>
fact I cannot ever recall seeing an obvious pair of raptors at the<br>
same prey well away from any nest site… or had the male caught the<br>
prey and had presented it to the female as part of pair bonding as<br>
only one adult was feeding and the other sat very peacefully only a<br>
couple of feet away. When they flew off down toward the Mbagathi far<br>
below, the bird that had been feeding carried the rest of the prey. So<br>
had they a nest nearby and one bird ate before carrying the rest off<br>
for the nestlings. We shall never know!<br>
During the day we found four pairs of Grey Crowned Cranes which might<br>
be returning birds, two singles and a pair of Secretarybirds were<br>
encountered, a Martial Eagle, Mottled<br>
Swifts coming down to drink at Athi Dam, and a White-tailed Lark<br>
singing on territory at the Vulture Drinking Pools. Black-winged Kites<br>
were in every obscure corner we visited.<br>
<br>
Migrants were restricted to the two Pallid Harriers, a few Eurasian<br>
Bee-eaters, numerous Barn Swallows, and singles of Eurasian Golden<br>
Oriole, Whinchat and Spotted Flycatcher.<br>
<br>
So on this day of non-birding I still had such a very enjoyable day<br>
even though candidly I can think of something that would have made it<br>
even better!<br>
<br>
Best for now<br>

the comment that the entire SGR is in the same Pentad, and we toyed<br>
with the idea of calling it the “Railway to Nowhere Pentad” in view of<br>
recent published articles calling it exactly that. People will know<br>
what Pentad they are in when they are next to it!<br>
