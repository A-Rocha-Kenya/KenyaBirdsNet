ADULT MALE LEVANT SPARROWHAWK, PAIR OF NORTHERN BROWNBULS AND A
POSSIBLY NESTING PAIR OF SHIKRA ON NATURE KENYA SUNDAY BIRDWALK AT
LUKENYA.

On 17th November I was part of the fortunate group of around fifteen
members of Nature Kenya who were on a birdwalk at Lukenya. We recorded
somewhere towards 115 species that day all in the same Pentad (the
exact figure is not out as yet).

This note just covers the three most unexpected species that we saw,
as they are important locally.

I saw a small raptor soaring just off of the escarpment, and said I
think there is a small falcon up there, as the wings were being held
with a pointed scythe-like silhouette, the primaries curving back to a
point, not spread. It was lost behind a tree, but then appeared in a
dive which brought it right past the group as it was now on a level
but still accelerating flight until lost from sight towards the end of
the escarpment. We were all so glued to this bird that in spite of
many photographers present, no-one took a photograph!
The reason being that in spite of narrow wings this was not a falcon,
but an Accipiter; it was showing both upper and underparts. The
upperparts were grey including the rump, but the underside appeared so
white, especially on the non flight-feathers which seemed to flash
white as the bird flapped after the initial dive. It was as if the
ends of the primaries had been dipped in solid black ink, such was the
contrast and all remarked on this striking appearance. The underside
of the flight feathers were also very pale, and although the bird was
travelling fast, the impression was given that the entire underwing
was uniform silvery-white, in stark contrast to the striking black
wingtips. There was a pinkish flush to the upper-breast which also
appeared uniform at that speed. This was an adult male Levant
Sparrowhawk, and there are very few records from this region.

In the same place we had been getting excellent views of a pair of
Northern Brownbuls, they were feeding in thick scrubby trees at the
foot of the escarpment, I have not heard of any records from this area
before, the only regular closest site for this species is Ruiru. I
would expect them at the base of Ol Donyio Sabuk, although am not
aware of records, and the base of Lukenya is very like that, but not
as wooded.

The third species was at a dam not far from the Mountain Clubs of
Kenya (who had been our very gracious hosts for this days excursion on
their land), it involved a vocal pair of Shikras that may have been on
a territory. There are precious few records from near Nairobi before,
and all have related to single birds, but these birds flights out from
the dam and returning, as well as keeping in contact vocally, suggests
that they might breed.

There is still a dearth of migrants, our only Palearctics were a three
Common Buzzards, the Levant Sparrowhawk, a couple of Common Swifts,
one Nightingale, one Garden Warbler, three Willow Warblers and one
Isabelline Shrike, and Ngulia Ringing starts today so it will be
interesting to see what they are recording.

Best to all
Brian
