Thanks so much for your update Mark, really interesting you have a
pair of Shikras on Maanzoni as well, it certainly suggests that they
are moving out of their vagrant status towards potentially rare
resident in this region. NNP has had just three singles ever.
Really sorry you were not with us, even without the three major
surprises, and of course the abysmal presence of migrants it was one
of those truly exceptional days with constantly new birds appearing
the entire time we were there.
Best for now
Brian

All,
My patch is the next door pentad to Lukenya at Maanzoni.
I too have had a pair of Shikra  on my dam, both this year and last year.
So maybe we have a trend!
Mortified I couldnâ€™t join you for the Levant, as I visit Lukenya
pretty regularly.
Mark
