All,
<div>My patch is the next door pentad to Lukenya at Maanzoni.</div>
<div>I too have had a pair of Shikra &nbsp;on my dam, both this year and last year.</div>
<div>So maybe we have a trend!</div>
<div>Mortified I couldn’t join you for the Levant, as I visit Lukenya pretty regularly.</div>

<p>ADULT MALE LEVANT SPARROWHAWK, PAIR OF NORTHERN BROWNBULS AND A<br>
POSSIBLY NESTING PAIR OF SHIKRA ON NATURE KENYA SUNDAY BIRDWALK AT<br>
LUKENYA.<br>
<br>
On 17th November I was part of the fortunate group of around fifteen<br>
members of Nature Kenya who were on a birdwalk at Lukenya. We recorded<br>
somewhere towards 115 species that day all in the same Pentad (the<br>
exact figure is not out as yet).<br>
<br>
This note just covers the three most unexpected species that we saw,<br>
as they are important locally.<br>
<br>
I saw a small raptor soaring just off of the escarpment, and said I<br>
think there is a small falcon up there, as the wings were being held<br>
with a pointed scythe-like silhouette, the primaries curving back to a<br>
point, not spread. It was lost behind a tree, but then appeared in a<br>
dive which brought it right past the group as it was now on a level<br>
but still accelerating flight until lost from sight towards the end of<br>
the escarpment. We were all so glued to this bird that in spite of<br>
many photographers present, no-one took a photograph!<br>
The reason being that in spite of narrow wings this was not a falcon,<br>
but an Accipiter; it was showing both upper and underparts. The<br>
upperparts were grey including the rump, but the underside appeared so<br>
white, especially on the non flight-feathers which seemed to flash<br>
white as the bird flapped after the initial dive. It was as if the<br>
ends of the primaries had been dipped in solid black ink, such was the<br>
contrast and all remarked on this striking appearance. The underside<br>
of the flight feathers were also very pale, and although the bird was<br>
travelling fast, the impression was given that the entire underwing<br>
was uniform silvery-white, in stark contrast to the striking black<br>
wingtips. There was a pinkish flush to the upper-breast which also<br>
appeared uniform at that speed. This was an adult male Levant<br>
Sparrowhawk, and there are very few records from this region.<br>
<br>
In the same place we had been getting excellent views of a pair of<br>
Northern Brownbuls, they were feeding in thick scrubby trees at the<br>
foot of the escarpment, I have not heard of any records from this area<br>
before, the only regular closest site for this species is Ruiru. I<br>
would expect them at the base of Ol Donyio Sabuk, although am not<br>
aware of records, and the base of Lukenya is very like that, but not<br>
as wooded.<br>
<br>
The third species was at a dam not far from the Mountain Clubs of<br>
Kenya (who had been our very gracious hosts for this days excursion on<br>
their land), it involved a vocal pair of Shikras that may have been on<br>
a territory. There are precious few records from near Nairobi before,<br>
and all have related to single birds, but these birds flights out from<br>
the dam and returning, as well as keeping in contact vocally, suggests<br>
that they might breed.<br>
<br>
There is still a dearth of migrants, our only Palearctics were a three<br>
Common Buzzards, the Levant Sparrowhawk, a couple of Common Swifts,<br>
one Nightingale, one Garden Warbler, three Willow Warblers and one<br>
Isabelline Shrike, and Ngulia Ringing starts today so it will be<br>
interesting to see what they are recording.<br>
<br>
Best to all<br>
Brian<br>
