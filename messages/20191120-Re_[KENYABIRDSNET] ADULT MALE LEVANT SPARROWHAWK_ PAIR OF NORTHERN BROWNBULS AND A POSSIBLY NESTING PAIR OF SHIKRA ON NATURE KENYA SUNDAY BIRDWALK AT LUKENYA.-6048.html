Thanks so much James,
I know about records from Kasarani, but never a suggestion that they
(or any others) had bred, has it been documented and I have missed it?
When you read up about the historical distribution, this is all
representing a first incursion into the Nairobi region, which is very
interesting,
Best for now
Brian

Dear Brian and All,

As per Jennifer Oduori and James Kuria N'dungu (and others), Shikra have
been breeding annually in the Makadara/Hamza area of Nairobi (between
Embakasi and Kasarani) for some years now. It's a regular bird in the SE
parts of the city with a few drifting westwards to the NNP and
Karen-Langata.

Thanks for sharing these nice records Brian.

Regards,

James

Thanks so much for your update Mark, really interesting you have a
pair of Shikras on Maanzoni as well, it certainly suggests that they
are moving out of their vagrant status towards potentially rare
resident in this region. NNP has had just three singles ever.
Really sorry you were not with us, even without the three major
surprises, and of course the abysmal presence of migrants it was one
of those truly exceptional days with constantly new birds appearing
the entire time we were there.
Best for now
Brian

All,
My patch is the next door pentad to Lukenya at Maanzoni.
I too have had a pair of Shikra on my dam, both this year and last year.
So maybe we have a trend!
Mortified I couldn’t join you for the Levant, as I visit Lukenya
pretty regularly.
