<div dir="ltr"><div>Hi Brian,</div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;ve been told they definitely breed but the specifics haven&#39;t been documented yet. They&#39;ve been present in SE Nairobi for a good 15+ years I think, and it could well represent a recent northwestward expansion, from the Tana drainage perhaps. Some other species that seem to be slowly establishing, probably also from areas to the SE of Nairobi are Mariqua Sunbird, Lizard Buzzard, Sombre Greenbul, Red-headed Weaver, perhaps also Pallid Honeyguide and Hinde&#39;s Babbler. When taken in combination with the absence of records of real dry country species from Nairobi (Magpie Starling, Southern Grosbeak Canary, Green-winged Pytilia, Black-throated Barbet etc.) since the 1950&#39;s-1970&#39;s, it suggests Nairobi is slowly becoming wetter and warmer. I wonder if the climate data from 1950-present says as much? Can we expect a Peter&#39;s Twinspot or Red-capped Robin Chat in Nairobi in coming years? There&#39;s already been a Bearded Scrub Robin at NMK a few years ago.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Regards,</div><div><br></div><div>James<br></div></div><br><div class="gmail_quote"><div dir="ltr" class="gmail_attr">On Wed, 20 Nov 2019 at 08:13, Brian Finch &lt;<a href="mailto:birdfinch@gmail.com">birdfinch@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br></div><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex">Thanks so much James,<br>
I know about records from Kasarani, but never a suggestion that they<br>
(or any others) had bred, has it been documented and I have missed it?<br>
When you read up about the historical distribution, this is all<br>
representing a first incursion into the Nairobi region, which is very<br>
interesting,<br>
Best for now<br>

&gt; Dear Brian and All,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; As per Jennifer Oduori and James Kuria N&#39;dungu (and others), Shikra have<br>
&gt; been breeding annually in the Makadara/Hamza area of Nairobi (between<br>
&gt; Embakasi and Kasarani) for some years now. It&#39;s a regular bird in the SE<br>
&gt; parts of the city with a few drifting westwards to the NNP and<br>
&gt; Karen-Langata.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks for sharing these nice records Brian.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Regards,<br>
&gt;<br>

&gt;&gt; Thanks so much for your update Mark, really interesting you have a<br>
&gt;&gt; pair of Shikras on Maanzoni as well, it certainly suggests that they<br>
&gt;&gt; are moving out of their vagrant status towards potentially rare<br>
&gt;&gt; resident in this region. NNP has had just three singles ever.<br>
&gt;&gt; Really sorry you were not with us, even without the three major<br>
&gt;&gt; surprises, and of course the abysmal presence of migrants it was one<br>
&gt;&gt; of those truly exceptional days with constantly new birds appearing<br>
&gt;&gt; the entire time we were there.<br>
&gt;&gt; Best for now<br>

&gt;&gt; All,<br>
&gt;&gt; My patch is the next door pentad to Lukenya at Maanzoni.<br>
&gt;&gt; I too have had a pair of Shikra on my dam, both this year and last year.<br>
&gt;&gt; So maybe we have a trend!<br>
&gt;&gt; Mortified I couldn’t join you for the Levant, as I visit Lukenya<br>
&gt;&gt; pretty regularly.<br>
